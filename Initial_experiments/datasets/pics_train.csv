Milky Way over Lion's Head

This is a 12 image panorama of the milky way body over the iconic Lions Head in Cape Town, South Africa. I have been wanting to get this photo for a while now, but is only possible when the conditions are perfect due to the extreme light pollution from the city centre and surrounding suburbs. The perfect conditions require a new moon and low fog rolling over the city from the atlantic ocean to help reduce the light pollution so that the milky way is visible. I have attempted this shot several times which includes hiking part way up Table Mountain and more often then not just sitting in the fog. I finally managed to capture this photo at 5am yesterday morning just as the fog was starting to roll back out over the ocean. Bucket list photo for me :)

Nikon D600, loawa 12mm lens, 25sec, 2.8, 1600"
213;I have a dumb question. I have never seen the Milky Way before with my own eyes and all the pictures I've seen have been from long exposure shots. Is it physically possible to see if with your own eyes with the correct conditions??
214;Astonishing 
215;That is a stunning picture wow!! 
216;The skies over Africa are truly amazing.
217;Hiked up Lions Head a few months ago, it's fantastic! Bring water!
218;Looks like I‚Äôm looking down into a pond seeing a koi fish

222;Mind blowing to me how someone could determine our place in the vastness of this galaxy. Probably why I'm not an astronomer.
223;It freaks me out that we can see the hub of a giant galaxy in the night sky.

318;My final paper in my English class this year was about death as a monster so for my final creative project I attempted to recreate the book of the dead from one of my favorite movies, The Evil Dead. I purchased a tooling double shoulder from Tandy on sale and dyed it with eco-flo oil dye I got from Tandy as well. It took about three days all in all but I‚Äôm pretty happy with the way it turned out. This is probably my third big project I‚Äôve done for anything other than just for fun. I used a swivel knife for most of the detail work and a background tool for the mouth and eyes. The back side I cut with a swivel knife, tooled the ear, and then punched holes with a 4mm craftool a quarter inch each side to get my stick marks and used artificial sinew to make the stitches as well as the binding for the paper and spine. The one thing I probably would have done differently if I were to do it again would be to use a pear shader for the ear instead of a background tool.

1166;"I just took Amtrak up and down the California coast (Oceanside to San Luis Obispo and back). It‚Äôs about 7.5 hours each way. Driving with traffic would have taken 6 hours. Without traffic would have taken 4 hours.

I figured that even though it would take longer, I could sit on the train and get some work done. The train advertised having WiFi. Unfortunately they use cellular service to get the connection so it was only available maybe half the time. Of course, my phone had no service at these same times so no hotspot either.

The train itself has definitely seen better days. The interior just felt very worn.

I looked up why we can‚Äôt have a faster, nicer train going up the west coast, and mostly it comes down to a lot of NIMBY‚Äôs and local regulations that prevent putting up the electrification (overhead electrical cabling) that‚Äôs necessary."

Kind of funny that retard is one of the taboo words when it means having an IQ between 70 and 75, but moron (50-69) and idiot (below 20) are completely fine.

1929;"To create a shot like this is easy.  No, you do not need to edit it.  You need a camera with fstops.   It is called depth of field.  You shoot with a very small aperture setting so that the entire photo is in focus.   Something people did all the time before  digital made it all point and shoot and shoot and shoot.  
  Set you aperture to f22.  Need bright sunlight.   Set everyone up and focus somewhere between the two.  Change your fstops going higher and higher (Smaller and smaller aperture)  until it all comes into focus.

2074;"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/65j4bt/i_have_lost_62lbs_and_still_have_18_to_go/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

In the original post I went into detail on how I did it, but the gist is: it was done entirely naturally. I did not once take any supplements or receive any 'help' from a substance. I merely stopped eating over 4,000 calories a day and mildly worked out. All of the work outs I did were in my room or just walking around Disney for a couple hours. My original goal was 165lbs, which at the time seemed super low and impossible, but once I got around the 180 mark I realized it might not be so hard. After that the pounds just kept falling off. 

I am at a steady weight of 150 - 147 now. Some days I will go up to 155, but by the morning will be back at 150. 

I eat cookies and cake and ice cream and brownies and whatever else you're going to ask me. I eat pizza and pasta and bread. I drink Starbucks and have been known to have a beer or two. 

The trick is to not eat a truck load. Only eat what you need. Eat one cookie and one scoop of ice cream. And that's it. If you want more, drink some tea or coffee and distract yourself with a movie or friends until your tummy settles. Don't let your belly be in charge, but do listen to what it has to say. If you constantly really want cake, you may just be craving sugar or salt. There are plenty of other things you can eat to stop your cravings that are just as yummy but not as bad for you. But once in a while, totally have that piece of cake. You deserve it.

I'm off today and would be happy to answer any questions you may have regarding my weight loss or your own journey. Remember to believe in yourself. You can accomplish anything. 

Just do it.
Don't let your dreams be dreams."

2115;"As a desert dweller, I can tell you that these are actually pretty docile and aren't in danger of getting stung unless you're actively trying to hurt it. They are solitary, so seeing more than one is rare. They are also tend to walk on the ground and when they do fly, it's low to the ground, slow, and not for very long because of how heavy they are compared to other flying insects. They're large and tend to flutter their orange wings while walking on the ground, so they are pretty noticable. Besides, you aren't a tarantula, so it'll ignore you even in close proximity.

tl;dr Unless you're trying to hurt it, it's not going to hurt you. "

2136;"I stayed at a resort in Mexico before I had lasik, and one morning, stepped barefoot on something black that stung the bottom of my foot because I didn't really see it. I got down closer to see it, and saw what it was, freaked out, and killed it. My foot went slightly numb &amp; I was worried because googling led me to believe I'd soon be in excruciating pain.

So, I get a cup from breakfast, put the thing in it &amp; saran wrap it in, take it to the front desk, and ask what it is &amp; to see the doctor. The staff played dumb &amp; said the doctor wasn't in, they didn't know what it was, had never seen one before etc. etc. I told them housekeeping must have let it in because they left your door open while cleaning, and they denied that too, even though you clearly see it throughout the property (the place was HUGE with hundreds of rooms).

2150;I wouldn't call it interesting. I would call it busy and chaotic. The phone camera has added an unpleasant amount of noise and grain. The lighting is too dark so the aesthetics are very poor.
