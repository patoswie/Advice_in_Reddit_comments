[NeedAdvice] Stopping wasting time and working hard;t3_83lkwi;2;"I need to work really hard on some particular thing which I actually and really enjoy working upon. The major problems is not motivation or the desire to work hard, but these three major problems: 

(a) I'm procrastinating very much to start working on that everyday. Like in most of day at night I decided I will work hard on  the day after, but on most of days my routine goes something like this: Wake up at 08, do random useless stuff on computer till 10 and then eat and then do again random useless stuff on computer till noon 01, then sleep, and work on that thing for thirty minutes, that too not focused properly, then do computer/sleep/random useless thing till night. (Although I'm in my senior year of high school, I'm pretty much free to not go to school any day I wish due to some stupid advantage due to some test scores). I realized this is pretty much my daily routine for the past three months and I gotta break from this.

(b) I can't focus on it for more than ten minutes at a stretch. I mean, things like pomorado technique used to help me, but now a days due to not focusing on anything for a long amount of time, I get heavily distracted within five~ten minutes of starting to work on something (this is also since the last three months)

(c) Sometimes I feel very lethargic to work like I don't feel like doing anything and just randomly sit idle and waste my time. I feel like I need some kick to start working, but like say on ~60 % of the day I just simply can't motivate myself to start working.

Any help is appreciated, thanks !";5;"Fix up your morning routine

When you wake up, have a set routine you follow that sets you up for the day.

Make sure at the end you DON'T go on to the computer and do random useless stuff, this will only trigger that neural pathway/habit for you to want to continue engaging in it throughout the day.

I suggest you go to a library or someplace else you're able to work/study from that isn't your normal place of recreation/relaxing.

This will help break the cycle and makes you want to work more because you've already gone through the effort of setting up at a new place.

Also install something like Get Cold Turkey or Self Control to stop yourself from random useless surfing etc when you want to be working.

If you do this you'll find that your levels of focus will boost automatically, just make sure you take breaks at a frequent times";2;0.4;[[0.95560859]];[[0.57218025]];0.9709;0.17800000000000002;0.6970000000000001;0.124;0.7906;0.114;0.838;0.047;-0.013000000000000013;-0.051239837398373976;0.013311688311688323;-0.0645515257100623

Any help is appreciated, thanks !";5;"You need to connect with your 'WHY'. 

It's the motivation that drives each of us to accomplish anything of difficulty. The reason people can battle through tough and even dangerous situations is that they're deeply rooted in their 'why' of doing that thing, whatever it is.

When you can connect with your internal motivation for something, you'll work hard at it despite the obstacles. 

This applies even when it's something you love doing anyway. 
A personal example from my own life is that after singing professionally for some years, I lost the desire and drive to gig after my accompanist went on tour with another band for a period. But when I reconnected with why I loved singing and what initially drove me to do it, I haven't looked back.

Ask yourself why you want to do that thing. Is it for someone else's benefit? Or are YOU getting something from it?

The key is being able to connect with a motivation driven by an INTERNAL desire (one related to what you want and not what someone else wants).

This doesn't mean being selfish. In fact, it's the only way to be truly unselfish. No one would ever sacrifice their own life just because someone else wanted them to. They could only give up their life willingly if they were deeply connected to a deep personal desire. 
E.g. Jesus -&gt; deep personal desire to save mankind
Soldier -&gt; deep personal desire to protect his country/way of life
Mother -&gt; deep personal desire to save the life of her child.

When you truly connect to your own internal motivation, you'll find that you can work on that project or task and not even watch the clock.

And even when things get tough, you'll have the grit to see it through to the end.

[NeedAdvice] How to keep up with need-to-do things like housework when in chronic pain?;t3_83fk59;4;"I have been suffering from severe back and neck pain, and a groin strain that I'm not even sure how I got, for the last month or two and I've noticed I've been unable to keep up with the physical demands of keeping my apartment clean; when the weekend comes around, all I want to do is rest. I work a full-time job, and while I can keep up the pace at work, by the time I get home I'm so exhausted that it's a miracle if I can even get the dishes done.

I feel guilty that the apartment always looks like trash every week; I'd probably be kinder to myself, but I'm not the only one living here as my boyfriend also lives with me and feel guilty having him have to deal with the mess as well. He helps me around the house - he's the primary cook, and we also switch off doing dishes (no dish-washer, so we have to do it by hand) and he also does the laundry which is a big help as our apartment does not have a washing machine so we always need to load up bags of laundry to take over to his parent's place which is about a ten minute walk away. (We also have no car... We live cheap.)

The fact he works much longer hours than me, coupled with these things, typically leaves the housework to me. As our apartment has hardwood floors and is relatively small, I used to have no issue cleaning and it would be done in an hour or two flat, deep cleaning and all. However, since my severe back and groin pain, I've just found it a monumental task to keep up with the demands of it, but I'd feel guilty laying around while my boyfriend literally does everything - that's not right.

The more you notice the pain, the more brain neurons assigned to it, which makes you notice the pain even more.  Try breathing exercises.  Keep your attention on your breathing instead of on the pain.

I do take OTC pain pills, but they're less effective than you'd think.";6;"Hey, sufferer of multiple herniated discs, here.  I know how you feel.  That struggle is real.  And here's what I want you to know:

Every tiny contribution you make *matters*. You are important though you cannot live the way you once did.  Just the reality that you feel bad about not doing what you once did in the way you once did reveals you are a good person.  I want you to capture that good person and start believing in him/her.  

Start by positive focus.  I don't mean fairy tales and unicorns, but find a motivational video that resonates with you or find a motivational blog that makes you feel good about you and *read it every day* without fail.  Don't switch to another blog or video.  Stick with the one that captures your heart and resonates with your inner being.  This is important.  You want to infuse into your own mind your goodness instead of thinking of yourself harshly.  

Put your mind into a position where it is hyper focused on the good in you.  The disability exists, but it doesn't mean you're not GREAT.  The pain is deplorable, but it there are breaks you can take advantage of - not to impress anyone else - but breaks that you can use to find even the tiniest things to do so you can continue to believe in yourself. 

That's what I did.  And here's what else I did:

I took the number of rooms and committed to 10 minutes cleaning per day.  They didn't need to be consecutive, I didn't need to be perfect and I was allowed *to fail*.  I could break up the tasks because my pain would heighten at different times.  Where one cleaning task would hurt, another wouldn't hurt as bad and I had to make that discretionary decision all the time.  I have six rooms in the house, so that is only one hour a day total.   

The power of compounding:  If you spend 1 hour a day split into ten minutes for each room per day at the end of the year you will have spent 365 hours cleaning that house.  Imagine how much gets done over 365 hours! 

I did the same thing with the tile in the bathroom.  I love shiny clean porcelain tile and for years watched sadly as scum and filth grew on those beautiful tiles.  I was despondent that I couldn't jump in and clean.  Eventually, I committed to cleaning 4 tiles at a time until it was all clean again.  Sometimes the first tiles were getting dirty again before I finished the entire bathroom tile, but it was far better than when I started.  I upped the number of tiles per day to keep up.  It was a tiny challenge that boosted my self esteem.  I don't mind saying I cried through it sometimes.  It's tough being in pain such as you are.

And you these things at the time and pace that you need with the only commitment being 10 minutes per room per day.  Can't do anything more than pick up the laundry off the floor?  No problem! You made it to the door!  Let's say you can't bend over any more after picking up socks.  Grab a dirty sock and reach out and dust a surface or two.  Hang in there as long as you can, but no more than  ten minutes.  

Note:  Some people break this down to 2 minutes at a time. It still works.  Ten minutes will help you get caught up possibly over the next month and then you can dwindle it down to 2 minutes.  

The first order of business is to believe in yourself.  

The second order of business is to simply ""suit up and show up"".  Make the commitment to show up for the task even if you don't do much. That's the beginning.  Your initial goal is to establish the habit and find the routine that works for you.  Can you make the walk to the door of the room?  Okay.  Do that.  You're good.  While you're standing at the door way, can you walk over to the dresser and straighten the clothes in one drawer?  Good!  

Keep it simple and be proud of every mental leap you make over the pain being certain to be honest with yourself. 

It takes time!  Be good to yourself in the meantime.  Speak kindly to yourself.  ""Be careful what you tell yourself, you're listening.""

I had to resolve with myself that I was no longer the person I once was and that I probably would never be again.  Then, I had to learn to be okay with that and realize that I am still valuable.  My family still loved me and supports me, right?  Why don't I support myself through this?  

I carried this adventure on to include lying on my side in the grass next to the garden while *weeding*.  I simply was not going to stop living life despite my back pain.  Just those few precious freeing moments where I was doing something I really love made a huge difference in my mental attitude which compounded itself into my own self esteem growing over time.  

It seems the moon and the stars must be in perfect alignment before that right neurosurgeon or doctor's treatment shows up and makes a difference.  

But it will happen and when you're through it you will be amazed at the awesome person you've become.  

Eventually, I had the neck surgery which was a real game changer.  I never once believed I would ever be able to stab a shovel in that heavy clay soil all by myself, but it happened and I'm able to so so much more even with multiple problems in my lower back.

[NeedAdvice] How to get myself to sleep earlier;t3_88r78y;6;"Hello everyone, so this is my first time posting here, hope this is right...

So, lately I've been sleeping at crazy hours at night (like 12 to 1 am) and for school days I have to get up at like 4,5 am and on weekends I sleep at 12 am at best, 1.30 at worst and wake up 10 am at best and 12 pm at worst. Being 15, I feel like this sleep schedule is really ruining me.

For weekdays, I stay up this late at night to finish up my homework after Redditing and playing video games (read:procrastinating), even if I get home at 4(early time) I still manage to drag it on for that long. For weekends, I do the exact same thing since I have nothing else better to do.

This has gone on since like, last year and I feel that it is not that great for me. I'm constantly tired at school, I can't think productively or concentrate and the moment I get on the bus to go home, I mostly feel like sleeping. Literally just now one of my family members found some white hair on the back of my head.

It sounds hokey, but it's been the only thing that has worked for me. Phones and computers are like coke to my brain.

All tips are appreciated~ Also thanks for reading this if you made it this far.";11;"First: If you sense that this might tie into a health problem, discuss it with your health care provider. If you're under a doctor or therapist's care, sleep problems are relevant to their interests. 

If you're solving this on your own, you must start by persuading yourself that nothing but sleep is worth doing after your target bedtime. If homework is more important than sleep to you, you'll have to get it done outside of sleeping hours or else you will remain sleep deprived. If Reddit is genuinely more important than sleep, consider striving for a schedule on which you fall asleep around 10pm and wake up around 6am to Reddit on weekends. 


Once you get your schedule unfucked to free up the time you should be sleeping from other commitments, form the habit -- just as you'd form any other habit -- of placing yourself into your bed, ready for sleep, at your target bedtime. Use whatever techniques you've been successful with for forming other habits in the past to do this. If you find yourself lying in bed unable to sleep, practice meditation and relaxation exercises, or journal. It's also helpful to try to stay away from sun-mimicking lights after sunset -- use a red-shift application on screens, and prefer small reading lights or lamps over a room's overhead lights when given the choice. 

Another option, of course, is to treat sleep cycle skew like jet lag. You can drop your body back into a more normal cycle using drugs that're available OTC in most places -- caffeine at the start of the day, melatonin at the end. Frankly, for your circumstances this approach doesn't seem worth bothering with, because it wouldn't address the underlying causes which, left as they are, would just ruin your schedule again quite soon.";2;0.18181818181818182;[[0.96726867]];[[0.58864275]];0.3832;0.107;0.7959999999999999;0.09699999999999999;0.9719;0.14400000000000002;0.7879999999999999;0.068;-0.06599999999999999;0.06142857142857142;0.207;-0.14557142857142855

Everybody suggests meditation like it's a one-size-fits-all cure-all. Truth is, it's a bit difficult to get into, especially because there's this aura of mystic surrounding it.

Have you tried playing any instruments? Drums have helped me a lot.

What I do is count to five and say GO! and then start doing whatever I need to do. (This works great when taking cold showers). Try doing whatever it is you need to do for only 20 seconds.

I've been through this phase before too, and it can be difficult to break but just like anything, it comes to practice and repetition...

What I suggest may be silly but its worked for me and countless others in the past...

It's to practice waking up and getting out of bed ASAP.

Yeah, literally practice doing that.

Do it until you dont even need to think anymore about the steps you take to get out of bed.

Also put your phone away and out of arms reach.

I've got some more autonomy here and working more individually instead of as a team member and my work is suffering because of it. I've got a few side hustle projects lined up to help me transition out of this job, but my discipline to work hard and actually put in the sweat equity to get what I want seems to have disappeared. Im terrified that I'm going to miss my opportunity to bounce back. Please help";23;"I know it's cliche but see a doctor and talk about.

[NeedAdvice] Should I drop my classes or is there a way to cope and how?;t3_7v4s0b;3;"This is my first post in this sub. For the past month, I have been feeling terrible about everything. Lots of unfortunate life events happened since the start of 2018:
- My family had the flu and then I got the flu, missed the first week of the semester.
- My dad had severe back pain and was unable to go to work. He also fell on ice and sprained his wrist. I saw his life falling apart and it affected me greatly (but he's better now).
- I was stressed out about choosing courses and dropping some because I got a job opportunity.
- Finally found a proper schedule but then I lost my job and it was the company's fault.
- I was depressed for a month and anxious about everything, fell behind in my school work.
- Sought help at university and in group therapy once a week plus on medication (Sertraline) now for the first time.
- Still unable to complete school assignments (even being granted one week extensions).

I just feel so far behind. I'm only in three courses and I have class two days a week and I do nothing but avoidance cope for the other five days. I've attempted my school work several times and I can't get past a couple pages of readings and there is so much to do. I really enjoy these courses but at the slow rate I am at, I'm at the point of giving up this semester since accomplishing these assignments and readings is like a goal out of reach. I didn't want to go back to university this semester. I wanted to take this semester off so I could get help in my coping skills and work around my phobia of essay-writing. I've been struggling with this for a year now and my grades are dropping. I've been stressed out for a month already and these assignments and tests are haunting me because I'm unable to work on them and it's pushing back more things upcoming in the future that I need to start focusing on. I guess I have way too much on my mind and I don't know where to start or how to tackle all this. I feel like I have an unrealistic goal in my head trying to be a perfectionist and accomplish everything which is impossible. I just wanted to ace my courses and give it all I have but time is something I don't have anymore with all the things that have happened so far. I don't know what I should do now. I can't concentrate on my school work at all. I wish I could hit the reset button for this semester and start over so I wouldn't feel this overwhelmed.

Anyways, should I drop my classes? I would lose $2000 which is a lot of money and I would have never thought of doing this but I'm desparate. I would even have to lie to my parents and say I'm still going to classes. I'm not really sure if I would lose out on the therapy and medication as well if I do this. I would also get a strike on my government loans. I would basically lose everything. This would be a terrible option honestly.

What else can I do to stop avoidance coping? How can get I get myself to do my work? I know slowly exposing myself to my work is a possibility but I don't know if I can stick to working. I can't face my fears. This year is going downhill quickly and my health is taking a toll.

I constantly avoid things that give me stress but then I get stress from avoidance coping. Any advice?";2;"Okay, you're basically me in another country so I'll give my two cents.

I just wasted two years avoidance coping. I could have had my MA TWO YEARS ago but I couldn't stop avoiding it because I have OCD perfectionism and I have been too afraid to attempt it, too scared of doing it shitty, too scared I was unprepared... And now I'm worried I'm too rusty, having been out of classes for two years.

I don't want to ever suggest someone do something that would make them mentally unhealthy and distressed, so I'm not going to say ""JUST DO IT!"" That said, I think you might want to consider that you are letting anxiety dictate your reality at the moment, and that's understandable. But imagine for a second that you do your work and damn, it's very shitty, and if you only had less anxiety and a better start to the semester you would have gotten a 100%. Sucks, right? But you meet with your instructor, work on it, fix it, save your grade. Bam. You've made academic progress, you didn't waste 2000 bucks, and you don't have a strike for your loan.

I feel like even the worst case scenario of attempting your academic work is not as bad as anxiety is telling you it is.

I wish SO BADLY that I had submitted a steaming pile of shit to my thesis director two years ago. Because it probably wouldn't be THAT bad and I'd be totally done right now. The reason I waited was because, similar to you, I had some shit hit the fan in my personal life and mental health life, ended up being prescribed meds (Sertraline ftw!), and the phobia of my thesis grew from a slight dread to a roaring dragon with sixteen heads.

So, is there an easy way to ""just do it""? No. This is gonna fucking suck if you do it because on top of everything else you're probably still adjusting to the Zoloft (if it's been less than two months) which could cause you even MORE anxiety. And, yeah, you did not have an ideal launching point to your academic year and you can't get that time back. So the surrounding circumstances are not ideal. And honestly? They never, ever will be. It's true! 

If you do this and pull through, yeah you might be exhausted, but you're gonna have developed KILLER fortitude and brain muscles to achieve IN SPITE of anxiety and you will have honestly leveled up your own brain.

The perfectionist in you is gonna hate every goddamn second of it because things aren't just right and you're not (perceiving yourself to be) doing as good a job as you might have under better circumstances but the perfectionist is gonna have to STFU because the perfectionist in you is gonna like the end  accomplishment anyway.

I believe in you, and I believe in me, and I believe in anyone else like us who avoids.

Exposure to fear is the only way through.

I wish you strength and bravery! This is just my two cents, and if you feel you need to take a break, of course follow your own gut. But I think, two years ago, I was stronger than anxiety thought I was, and avoidance coping only made things a trillion times worse.

[NeedAdvice] I routinely lose motivation to finish a task once I'm 90% there. How do I get more disciprine?;t3_84wfue;6;"Hello Everyone. Just created this account for questions like this one.

It's been this way as long as I can remember. As soon as the end of a task or project is in sight and I know exactly what I still have to do to get there, I completely lose interest in finishing it, as I have mentally already done so.

At work, this is not such a great issue, as I kind of *have to* finish those tasks. If I want to keep or improve my lifestyle that is.

But the problem isn't limited to mundane, boring, or frustrating tasks. It's basically any project, ranging from planting a flowerbed to learning a new language or skill, to playing video games. Particularly the latter makes a good example, I think, as it is something I enjoy a great deal.

Especially when it comes to (turn based) strategy games like Europa Universalis, or builders like Space Engineers, I'll be really into it for most of the game/project, as long as I'm thinking about what to do next (or what goes where). But as soon as victory/a functioning design is in sight, I just don't care anymore and actually going through with it becomes a chore.

So my questions are: Why is this? Why am I like this? And the one you might be able to help with: What can I do to change this? To find joy in (physically) completing work? To be disciplined enough to go through with the execution of an idea? (That last one may be a separate, though strongly related topic).

I'd appreciate your input and perspective";42;"Seems like you've identified a common behavioural pattern. I'm in a similar boat. I find excitement and an adrenaline rush whenever I start a new project, but the interest wanes once I'm actually grinding through it near completion. 

What I've found helpful is keeping a task list of ""Active"" and ""Completed"". A project, task, or item doesn't get moved into my ""Completed"" list until it's actually fully completed. This is a little mental trick that works for me, personally. When I see it in the ""Active"" list, it's stuck on my mind...until moved into the ""Completion"" list.

I'd appreciate your input and perspective";42;"I think that initially joy is novelty, and its not just you who feels this way. The amount of people who get gym memberships on a whim, or start any other hobby only to be disengaged later should tell you that its a common problem. So the good thing is that youre not alone in this.

The truth is that most tasks, especially longer term goals and longer projects, do not give instant gratification. Even playing a video game - most VGs take a while to finish. There's some work to be done no matter what the long term task is and I think thats where you get stuck...you like the initial thought of things but completing the thought takes work, and you avoid that work for whatever reason.

I cant really help you when it comes to video games (maybe just buy better games)? But for serious things, like school or work projects, something that has helped me a lot has been recognizing when that boredom kicks in.

One of the best tricks I can suggest is taking a pen and paper when a task seems overwhelming or long or boring, and then writing down ONE aspect of the task you want done. Sometimes, just seeing that you only have one ""to do"" will spring you into action, and youll get started to the point that you get immersed in the track.

I dont think you becoming bored by games and other recreational tasks is a big deal. If it affects your school work or projects at your job then I think you need to take it more seriously.

Also, its cliche at this point, but meditation (I strongly reccomend Headspace) may change your life.";5;0.11904761904761905;[[0.98275481]];[[0.7974875]];0.9531;0.14300000000000002;0.787;0.07;0.5292;0.095;0.821;0.084;0.061999999999999986;0.14189431258396776;0.09370370370370368;0.04819060888026407

For things that matter and you want to show other people, finishing may be because you fear the response you'll get. If you never finish that flowerbed people can't critique your work because ""it's not finished yet"". Here, realize that you can always try again if you're not satisfied, but you need a finished result or you can never truly start over.

But the problem isn't limited to mundane, boring, or frustrating tasks. It's basically any project, ranging from planting a flowerbed to learning a new language or skill, to playing video games. Particularly the latter makes a good example, I think, as it is something I enjoy a great deal.

Especially when it comes to (turn based) strategy games like Europa Universalis, or builders like Space Engineers, I'll be really into it for most of the game/project, as long as I'm thinking about what to do next (or what goes where). But as soon as victory/a functioning design is in sight, I just don't care anymore and actually going through with it becomes a chore.

So my questions are: Why is this? Why am I like this? And the one you might be able to help with: What can I do to change this? To find joy in (physically) completing work? To be disciplined enough to go through with the execution of an idea? (That last one may be a separate, though strongly related topic).

So, instead of thinking: I'm gonna play some games and then chew out the whole thing in one go (which leads to the playing-games never finishing), then just do a little.

It helps by making rather detailed to-do lists. Pick one minor thing from it, and then finish that. It might only take 5-10 minutes, but try to tell yourself: do that small thing, and go back to playing some video games. Repeat every 1-2 hours.

The point is to get you used to atleast doing something. Eventually you might find it gets easier and easier to do more with fewer/shorter breaks.

The problem is I don't know how to actually go about setting a goal and  formally ""planning"" a goal achievement. Even things like getting a job or getting into University weren't ""planned"", I just did what I thought I was supposed to.

Is there a simple method that you guys recommend for writing down and staying on track with goals?";3;"Write down those 10 goals, then only pick one.

The one you are most interested, enthused, or determined about.

Then set a day each time (when) and a place (where) and the goal you have (what) that you are going to do.

And do something that helps you make progress on that goal for at least 5 to 15 minutes each day.

Then repeat the next and the next and the next.

If you can do this for a week, then keep it up.

If you do it again for another week, then add another goal into the mix but only ONE.

If you don't manage to keep up the first goal for a week, drop it and then go to the second most interesting goal.

Just repeat and cycle through this until you find one that clicks and then keep building on it overtime.

This will help you build the daily habit that will eventually get you to your goals and stay on track.

It helps a lot to also review your goals daily if possible as it's very easy for us to forget them. Another big thing is actually writing down WHY this goal is important to you - there needs be a deeper meaning or purpose otherwise it's easy to drop it when there is the first sign of resistance or hardship.

Then stick with one goal until it's done. Also, define what done is. 

I started going to bed at 8PM. After I did that for a month, I started to wake up at 3AM instead of 5AM. I did that for a month. Then I started going to the gym for 30 mins. I did that for 2 weeks, then switched to an hour, did that for a month, then switched to an hour and a half. 

My goal was 1hr 30min in the gym, but I put in place the habits needed to do that before I ever step foot in the gym.

The first step in accomplishing any goal is understanding what you know and where you're going. The next step is about actually doing the darn thing to get to your goal. In your case, getting back in the habit of getting A's. No one can force you to do these things except for yourself. Of course no one WANTS to study all night, no one WANTS to wake up early for school, etc. But guess what? Having the courage and strength to do it even if you don't want to makes all the difference.

Laziness can be self-perpetuating. Sitting for hours on end, especially in front of a screen, creates inertia. Get up and do something, preferably outside.

[NeedAdvice] What to say to yourself / do when you realize you are procrastinating?;t3_85hnmd;17;"Hey GetDisciplined! 

I've made a horrible habit of procrastinating, I'll procrastinate anything, doing homework, doing chores, going to and getting out of bed. I don't have a lot of will power, and it's ruining my life. 

When I begin to notice that I'm procrastinating or hiding from something, I feel a resistance within me to fully realize it and stop it. I've become really good at doing this, sometimes to the point of staying awake until 5am, deliberately not questioning why I'm staying awake and the consequences of doing so.

What goes through your mind when you notice you are procrastinating or practising a bad habit? What do you say to yourself to stay disciplined, and how do you deal with the inner baby that won't face up to reality?";84;"There are many things you can say to yourself when you catch yourself procrastinating. What will be most effective will depend on your unique situation why you are procrastinating, your personality and the type of activity you are procrastinating. 

One tip that is more general that has worked for me and others I worked with is to realize that every time you procrastinate you strengthen the part of your brain that makes you procrastinate and re-inforce the procrastination habit. Every time we don't want to do something it is an opportunity for us to do the opposite of all that, a chance to strengthen our pre-frontal cortex (your procrastination fighter) and break the habit, making it a bit weaker. All it takes is to get STARTED. Even if you just stay with the task for 5min. It's that crucial moment when you are about to turn away from a task because it stirs up some negative feelings. That is your chance to get better long-term. So I put the focus more on improving my brain, myself, my procrastination in the long-term, than on ""I need to get this task done"". Getting the task done is more of a nice side benefit. The main benefit is training my brain so I can get ALL those tasks done more easily in the future. 

Another key is to be really kind to yourself and resist the urge to get annoyed/frustrated with yourself. Treat yourself like a little kid that is afraid of water or similar. Then just make a fair deal. OK, maybe it is really bad and you have every reason to want to avoid it, but maybe it is not.. you just think it will feel awful to do the task. Why don't we try it. Try to do the task for 5min, and then if it really is unbearable you can stop. Just as you would tell a kid that does not want to go into the water first time. Just put your toes in it and see how it feels.

1) I tell myself ""I am in control"". This re-frames my mind so I become more deliberate in my actions. Almost immediately, I feel calmer. I'm now in the driver seat and not on procrastination's leash. I feel stronger to kick away the urge to procrastinate, I start to question myself why am I not doing it, and I feel much more motivated to do the task.

2) I allow myself only 5 minutes to do the task. This gets over the inertia of starting. Most of the time, I end up doing more.

3) I break down the task. Sometimes, the task is too daunting. Your brain is already imagining how hard the task will be even if you have not done anything. When in reality, the task is actually doable. So to counter this, I break my task up into bite-size chunks. It makes it easier for the brain to process and ease myself into the task.

While I had class five days a week, class didn't start until 11 every day. Here's just a quick general list for you. 

Set multiple alarms.

Have a set wake up time.

Do something during your off days. (work, exercise, learn a new skill) Having class only two days a week gives you a lot of free time, so you need to find something constructive to do and stock with it. Even volunteering could be an option. Hell, learn how to code or something. 

Cut back on video games, reddit, YouTube, Netflix, social media. (I struggle with this too). 

Make a schedule/plan your days 

Make a to do list

I have some questions for you, what purpose does video games serve in your life? What is the benefit? When you're on your death bed, will you look back and say, ""you know, I'm so happy I got to diamond in league!""? What is more important, your gf, or pixels on a screen?

Though legit, if you want somebody to hold you accountable for what you do, feel free to pm me. Been trying to break similar habits myself, and I learned changing habits with another person is beneficial. Cause if one person slacks off the other can whip them into shape, and if both people slack off, they feel bad and want to change it.

For example, wake up 5 minutes earlier. If you get yourself out of bed before then, even better. But make it your goal to be out of bed by 10:55. It's not that appealing at first, but getting there is what is important. 

Same thing with being organized and keeping the room clean. When you start to throw your clothes on the ground, mentally check in with that. Be aware of what you're doing and see the big picture. Dirty dishes? Take one dish when you do leave your room. 

Something that works for me, as far as video games and social media, is getting off of it until your tasklist for the day is done or your at a part of your day that you can do that with. 

Writing a checklist also helps. Try and do things early. Being done with something before you HAVE TO is a satisfying feeling and it feels like you can put more effort into it that way. 

One last thing that has personally helped me, is having someone help you. I know that sounds silly, but if you can't hold yourself accountable, then have someone else help you. Tell your girlfriend your intentions, or just share with her something you're proud of that you did today. Use her to motivate you mentally if it helps. You have to take care of yourself before you can take care of someone else. 

Of course, there are tons of posts on this subreddit about different topics, and I think focusing on one main thing to become habit helps a lot too. For example, right now I'm working on a morning routine. It's doing wonders, but I want to make sure it sticks, so I'm focusing on making sure I do it daily until I don't even have to think about it. 

Good luck! You're already doing better than a lot of people by trying. You're fighting those bad habits mentally. You just have to get over that hump.

As the title says, I feel lost. Not the kind of lost where you don't know where to go in life, or where you don't have anyone you care about or that cares about you. A kind of lost that is somewhat deeper (?), as in I don't feel understood, and I'm not sure if I will ever be happy, and I'm fucking overweight and I've tried so many times to lose weight but somehow it has never worked, and my grandma died on Monday and she got me thinking about all of this. And I also feel alone and the world scares the shit out of me because there are so many things, and you can never grasp all of them and things that I dont understand scare me sometimes. I have a feeling I might be retarded or schizophrenic or something and everyone is just not telling me because of some reason.

I feel like I wanna say so much, I think so much, but I never really do when it matters. SOmetimes I feel like I have a deep understanding of the world and people, but then I remember how little I am and that I might just be another number in the books. I have a lot of ""friends"", I think they are my friends because I like meeting up with them and doing stuff but I really only have two or three close friends that I really trust. I don't want to cut my friends off, but I really don't know as I am too fucking shy to reach out to them and they also never really reach out to me.

I feel like my main problem is my weight. I think I can be super confident but my body is in my way (184 cm, 6'2 that should be - 125kg or something like 275 pounds). When I try to stick to something it works well the first week or so but then I slack off. There is not just one moment where it all breaks down but slowly always. I have thought about getting a tattoo like Casey Neistat to remember to stick to my plans. Also I love to drink, but every time I do I end up being wasted as fuck and not remembering anything, which is super embarassing and I hate myself for not knowing my limits in eating or drinking or really anything and I just wanna be happy but it seems so hard. Also I just started crying because I dont know what the fuck is going on and Im just hoping to feel happy one day and this is very overwhelming. And now I just noticed that I havent been thinking about this much or anything since I got to my computer, so technology might be numbing me? I really have no idea, and I would like to change so much about me. I would like to lose weight, learn to know my limits and stick to them and learn to be kind to everyone and not judge and to put others before myself since I have put myself first most of the times and I hate that.

";4;"Technology numbs you 100%. While you are using the computer or your phone your mind can't think about the problems in your life at the same time. You just get sort of a pain in the back of your mind instead. I've been using technology to escape for years.

About weight loss, let me tell you that you CAN lose it, anyone can. It's keeping the weight off during the bad parts of your life that's the hard part. I lost 35kg and all my family is still obese.

r/loseit is one of the best resources on the internet for how to lose weight. Basically it comes down to this:

- calculate how many calories a day your body needs to support itself based on your height and current weight (search calore calculator)

- eat 500 calories less than the above number

- do not eat anything where you don't know how many calories is in it

- get at least 30 minutes a day of any kind of physical activity to keep your body mechanisms working properly

500 × 7 = 3500 calories = 1 pound. You can lose a pound a week doing nothing but tracking what you eat and letting your body do all the work. I know this sounds like a pipe dream when you're a binge eater but your stomach shrinks when you eat less and you will feel full with less food.

I've read a lot about this, message me and I can coach you.

";4;"Welcome to *Existential Crisis* Central.

First, you're gonna need an anchor to provide some *strong* meaning in your life.  Mine is even just reducing overall suffering in this world a teeny tiny bit is a huge accomplishment.

Second, pick up ""Proper Posture"" good habit, and take a look at pictures of successful **fat** people.  They've got **Proper Posture** on auto-cast.  Trust me on this - our posture has a big effect on our mental well-being cause blahblahblah brain-signaling, etc.

Third, pick up good habits **ONE** at a time. Start with the most powerful and the most simple - Meditation (and Proper Posture).

For why, see: https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/7q9n4l/method_air_water_earth_fire/

**Pocket Meditation**

* Download this app - Breathe2Relax
* Set inhale length to 3 seconds.
* Set exhale length to 3 seconds.
* Set to 16 cycles.
* (optional) Maybe turn off all the audio sounds... up to you.

Every time you feel stress/upset, get this app out - follow the breathing metronome until you feel calm. If you want a proper meditation session, just repeat.

Oh, and 16 cycles per session is really more than enough to calm you down. FYI, our breathing pattern/rate directly affects our brains. Calm people breath differently from afraid, angry, excited people. Meditation is as good as medication.

Low-level to mid-level of meditation is like smoking marijuana or tobacco.

*Mid-level to upper-level of meditation feels like being on high-generating drugs.*";2;0.5;[[0.95332466]];[[0.52591797]];0.9888;0.16699999999999998;0.7120000000000001;0.121;0.9848;0.172;0.802;0.026000000000000002;-0.09999999999999998;0.0867063492063492;0.19272875816993465;-0.10602240896358542

Any advice, or direction to where I might find some advice is really appreciated.";3;"This sounds like a mindset issue, which is something I have personally worked on for the past few years. That is exactly where I would start. 

First, I would start by reframing the issue. Everyone has things they want to achieve in their live… they just may not know what yet. That’s okay. Start looking at it this way: “I haven’t found out what I want to achieve yet, but the challenge discovering what I want will one day make me unstoppable”. Frame is everything. If you think negatively, you will feel that way. Work on placing a positive spin on everything you do.

Sorry for the tangent above. I think an optimistic/abundance mindset is the most important aspect of our well-being. 

My recommended place to start with this challenge would be reading **Finding Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi**. Below are a few notes I took on the book, but I really recommend reading it since these will not give you a full understanding and actionable steps.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Happiness relies less on what we do, but rather how we do it.
Work can provide some of the most satisfying moments in our lives.

Clear goals, consistent feedback, and attainable challenges requiring concentration allow us to enter into flow moments, drowning out all other distractions.

The normal person’s attitude involves spending a lot of effort trying to cut corners, but this is short-sighted. Spending that same time trying to find ways to accomplish more will increase joy in the task at hand. Having the mindset to always improve and become more efficient develops the concentration and challenge needed for flow.

There are literally millions of potentially interesting things in the world to see, to do, and to learn about, but they don't become actually interesting until we devote attention to them. 

Instead of waiting for an external stimulus or challenge to grab our attention, we must learn to concentrate it more or less at will.

This will create a positive feedback loop. If you are interested in something you will focus on it, and if you focus attention on anything, it is likely that you will become interested in it*

How to get motivated to go to gym? [NeedAdvice];t3_7xxqe2;10;"I am sure that many people faced with the problem when you don't have strong enough motivation to go to gym regularly.

**Things I did to get motivated:**

* I bought a subscription to the gym which I like and which is quite expensive for a year, thinking that I would be sorry for the money spent - didn't work long as I always can find a reason why I can't go (to my surprise I always have serious reasons).

* I bought new clothes for training which helped me for some time to get motivated, but not for a long time.

* I watched lots of videos and looked at training programs which inspired me, but not for a long time again. 

* I tried to go to gym with a friend, it helped me most of all as I felt some responsibility. But with time everything is the same.

* I tried to make myself sure how it is important for my health and read many articles about it - I understand the necessity, but don't do it.

For me, my 'why' is because I wanted to show myself that I have what it takes to make a change in my life after being fat for my entire life. Not because I wanted people to stop making fun of me, but because I wanted to show my family, fiance and myself that I have the capability to work hard and reach goals.

Honestly, I never found motivation in my trainin, it's just something ""you do"" like washing your teeth, showering, cooking... It's just part of my rutine and my life. 

I've had different motivations throughout my first year, improve my bench press numbers, lift heavier in my squats... But all in all, the key to presistance is routine and consistence. 

You need to start thinking it's good for you, for your health and for your future, one day at a time, you can't promise yourself you'll go to the gym for 3 weeks, but you can promise yourself you'll go day after day.

If it helps, I used to be quite addicted to podcasts for a while and I would listen to them a lot, so I would just download a couple and go to the gym and do my routine while listening to those, it helped me a lot to make it less hard in days I felt too lazy and/or tired and make me go through it with ease without losing intensity or effort.

I take my stuff with me and I go before I get home.

Doing this on consistent days helps establish a subconscious routine, but habits like that can take an average of 66 days to cement.

&amp;nbsp;

Fun exercise and putting the gym on my way home always worked for me, but I do have another great tip I read in James Clear's habit guide that I really like a lot. It is basically using **small goals to aid in your habit formation**.

&amp;nbsp;

What if instead of forcing yourself to the gym every day you just put your workout clothes on at a specific time and did 10 jumping jacks? 

That is kind of how it works. The goal isnt to be at the gym for an hour every day, the goal is to get in the habit of exercising at a consistent time every day. The duration can vary.

Another way of putting it is you don't want to set a goal of a hot bod. You want to set a goal where you are a person who exercises regularly. The **hot bod** goal leaves every exercise you conduct as a failure because it doesn't result in a hot bod. The **person who exercises regularly** goal leaves you with a win every time you exercise at your planned time.

&amp;nbsp;

What if your goal is to run for 30 minutes today, but your excuse ends up being:

&gt; ""Ahhh I don't have time for a run cuz work ran late, better skip it"". 

With the method above you would just toss your clothes on and run for 5 minutes, or just run a few sprints, or just do a loop around the house. 

What you WANT is the **habit of getting in those clothes and moving your body at a regular time** because that is what leads to a habit of regular exercise and that leads to you becoming the person who exercises regularly.

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of all that? You might just find yourself with a hot bod, but that, dear friend, is not the goal ;)";3;0.33333333333333337;[[0.97390465]];[[0.60248333]];0.9875;0.184;0.7559999999999999;0.06;0.9876;0.109;0.867;0.024;0.039000000000000014;0.10375494071146243;0.15777777777777774;-0.05402283706631532

For example, at one time I used my employer’s gym.  I would schedule time for it like any other meeting.  When the time came the software would pop up a handy message.  I’ve already got years of conditioning that “Outlook message for a meeting means I must Go Do That Thing on the schedule”.   Without thinking about it I’d be in my way over to the gym. 

Likewise once I got a home gym, I realized I had to get in the habit of getting myself there.  Solution was easy: I just started bringing my morning coffee to my basement gym.   Every morning.  Even when not working out.  

When motivation fails habits kick in.  Get motivated, sure, but use that energy to build a solid habit.  Rely on the habit to carry you through those times when your emotions get in the way of your real goals.

You just have to be in the present! Simple! Do not think about what you will do in the gym or why you should skip this day and start fresh from tommorow. 

Just look around you and try to feel this moment (no past no future just present!). Now make a positive affirmation in your head that it is a good day to go to gym (even if it's bad day, just fake it). Go pack your bag, make your workout shake if you have one and drive or walk to the gym.

 Just keep one thing in mind to not think about any other thing apart from this moment. If you are making your shake, give your full attention to how you open the lid of the bottle and how you pour water and make your shake. Use your five senses to remain in present! 

Leave all your past and future aside at least for this moment! If you are walking to the gym, listen to the honking of cars and watch that old man on the other side of road, feel how you crush the leaves while walking and bam!! You are at the gym. Now you are on your own, do the goddamn reps!!!!!

There was never a time I left my house to go to the gym, instead I kept a stocked gym bag in the car at all times (clothes, shoes, lock, etc). When one came in so I could wash clothes, the other bag went out. 

My rule was simple, if I had to drive past the gym (or theoretically- no going around it by driving down a different street) I would go in. I had to spend at least 10 minutes working out or I burned 100 calories, whichever came SECOND. I had learned that my biggest struggle at the gym was that I'd want to quit from minute 4 to 8 (especially on cardio machines). Once I passed that though, my adrenaline was pumping so I'd just keep going. Sometimes for 40 minute, other times and hour and a half. 

It means I go soo much more than if I had to decide to workout. I'm already literally in front of the building with everything I needed to go inside. The other thing that makes it a positive experience is that I listen to comedy podcasts. I can't be bothered trying to regulate the tempo of my music. Sure I may look like a psycho sometimes because I'm just peddling away on a spin bike and chuckling to myself, but the time just flies by. I love to laugh so I save my favourites specifically for the gym. It is my built in reward. This might not work for everyone but it removes the decision and excuses.

I want to minimize my time on Facebook, Instagram etc. My question is will my career affected when I quitting social media?;1;"depends on the way you use it as a designer, I’m a graphic designer too and I don’t really use it to promote myself in any way. I post some stuff to my instagram but it’s mostly visual noise, good source for inspiration but there is a lot of bs on there. Need to clean that up. And facebook, for memes lol. 

I also use tumblr for inspiration but again, a lot of bs on it, same with pinterest. 

I find myself struggling with it too, especially wanting to delete what’sapp but that’s something I can’t afford right now. 

I’d say; only browse social media with a goal.

If you want to find trends then search for trends, if you need to contact a client through any platform then do that. It’s hard, mainly because social media is so distracting that it may distract you from why you’re there in the first place, but it helps a bit.

If you find yourself becoming addicted, it'd probably be worthwhile to remove yourself *personally* from social media, but keep accounts that focus specifically on your career to reap those social media benefits.

[NeedAdvice] Tired of current life situation, learning a new skill to change my life around.;t3_84vg9g;2;"Hey everyone. I've been reading posts on r/getdisciplined for a while now but never thought I'd gather the courage to make my own post. I'm a 27 year old dude from Antwerp and my life is not going the way I want it, and all I did was cry and whine and rant about it. Well, its time to change that. 

There was an article I've read called [""screw motivation, what you need is discipline.""](http://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/) and it got me fired up.


Currently, I work at a job I really dislike but the salary is fine, and I made my decision to start learning web development and hopefully move back to London and one day start my own mobile gaming company.

I want to take all of you who made some awesome posts for the past few months that I've read and gathered this hopefully life-changing courage to finally take some steps. I made a big plan in an app called Bear, and hopefully, I'll be able to share this with you once my 30 days are over. The plan is to code one hour every day, at least, using the 100daysofcode movement.

In the end, our lives are in our own hands and it's high time for me to take responsibility and action.

I know it will take enormous work and discipline for me to succeed, and I'm telling you this because honestly not a lot of other people care enough anyway. I also made a blog to have some form of ""journal"" where I write down my progress. I'd like to see how this month goes and report back to you guys.

If anyone is undergoing something I am atm or changing careers, please let me know, what did you do or how did you do it. I'd love some tips or advise, especially if you are a developer! Good luck to all of you, stay disciplined and focused!

If you have goals that you want to accomplish, but sleeping in is preventing you from making progress toward those goals, then you have a decision to make: 


A) Before you go to sleep, tell yourself “tomorrow I will roll out of bed as soon as my alarm goes off.” Roll out of bed as soon as your alarm goes off.  Do at least one thing (even if it’s only for 5 minutes) that will count as a step toward progressing toward your goals. 

B) Don’t do this and remain unsatisfied (a feeling which trickles into other aspects of your life). 


Exercising discipline in even the smallest things improves the quality of your life in so many ways.

1) Change your alarm's tone (easier to associate this new habit with a new alarm)

4) The second the alarm goes off, leap out of bed, chug the glass of water to interrupt the tendency to go back to bed after dismissing the alarm, and go do the next thing you'd be doing in your morning (afternoon?) routine

I'd love for some advice or some insite how other people may have overcome an issue like that. Thanks!";22;"I've been thinking about this and I've decided my days need a ""uptick"" and ""down setting"". I designed this around my ideal routine once I'm successful at my career/life.

Basically in the morning I get up for the single task of lighting my morning incense- light fragrance like Jasmine. It calms me and I feel like I'm wholesome. If I'm up I just go get in the shower and I'm going- whilst keeping internal dialogue begging myself not to think about it with intermittent profanities, complaining and shitting/being kind to myself helps. After my shower it's a more warm stick which helps me centre myself. Gets me to work.

It's crucial I also create a habit before bed to reinforce my morning routine. I burn a candle (fragrance based on what I need to soothe me), wash my face and stretch. This helps me be mindful and also get to bed with enough time to wake feeling rested. Puts me down basically.  

Taking supplements as part of a routine to track the passing of time makes me feel accomplished, centred, relaxed and...lush. The number of sticks/pills left after a time also help track days I've been successful at keeping the routine. So maybe dream about your ideal future self and incorporate things that acknowledge you're trying, you're becoming that person and help with discipline.

Basically I ""choreographed"" three movements I need to do to get up with parts of the song that is my second alarm.

1. Open my eyes

2. Get in position to get out of bed (I put my arm in a position ready to push myself up)

3. Actually get out of bed (so: pushing myself up and get onto my feet)

I practiced it a few times by lying in bed without sleeping and just doing it a few times. It's been months and it still works. 

 

An important part about this is that I don't have to turn off my alarms, I just let them roll for 1 minute and then they are over. No snoozes. I don't want any movement except for the three steps. It also helps that I say (usually not out loud) the actions at the point of the song I need to do them. So: ""Eyes... and arms... and up!"" (something like that, different language).";1;0.045454545454545456;[[0.9022986]];[[0.6264133]];0.4076;0.114;0.7609999999999999;0.126;-0.4963;0.063;0.851;0.086;0.010999999999999996;0.21153846153846154;0.06923076923076922;0.1423076923076923

I'd love for some advice or some insite how other people may have overcome an issue like that. Thanks!";22;"No amount of alarms or tricks is going to help you. 

What you need is a real reason to get out of bed. Right now you have said you don't really need to get out of bed to make money. So you're comfortable.

Tony Robbins says there are only two reasons we do anything.
1. To obtain pleasure
2. To avoid pain

Right now you get pleasure out of staying in bed and it's painful to get up earlier. 

You need to have a reason or scenario where that is reversed. Where it's more painful to stay in bed and achieve nothing than it is to get up and do something. It could be as easy as thinking ""If my life is exactly as it is now in one year, will I be happy?""

That can be a motivational factor that gets you to set some goals to work towards. If you know you're going to be miserable in one year at the same place in your life, perhaps you will get the ability to get out of bed.

On the pleasure side, visualize what life would be like to make money from your art. How much more satisfied and happy would you be with your life if you had the freedom to work when and where you want.

So set some goals.
And give a lot of thought to WHY you want to achieve them. Not superficial level reasoning but what your real desire is to achieve them. If you don't have this deep level of desire, it will be very difficult to overcome your current comfortable situation.

Hope this helps!";1;0.045454545454545456;[[0.88691288]];[[0.4203325]];0.4076;0.114;0.7609999999999999;0.126;0.9803;0.152;0.79;0.059000000000000004;-0.105;0.21153846153846154;0.12194616977225675;0.0895922917662048

[NeedAdvice] I have no idea what to do with my life, career-wise;t3_7uzyqs;8;"Hey, everybody! (Hi, Doctor Nick!)

I come seeking career advice. I have no idea what to do with my life, career-wise. I am 30 years old, and yet I am stuck in the college freshman mindset of “I wonder what I’ll be when I grow up and get a career! There are so many paths to choose!” I am paralyzed by the fantasy of choice. Certainly one of my hurdles is my wide array of interests and hobbies, and I’m not terribly sure about how to categorize them into “things I like/do for purely for fun” and “things I like/do for money-making.” If I’m honest with myself, I have trouble categorizing them because of silly egotistical purposes (“I want to be the world’s best XYZ-er and then everybody will like and praise me!”).

To give you some background info about myself: I went to an arts high school and most of my American friends today are professional artists; I have a BA with honors in anthropology and I’m a member of Phi Beta Kappa; I have an MPhil in ethnomusicology (2 year masters with a thesis defense—they use the British system in Hong Kong); although I’m from the US, I have lived, studied, and worked in Hong Kong for the past six and a half years (I moved here for love, but we broke up); I’ve been financially independent for the past six and half years, and I just started my own freelance business tutoring English and Latin and I am completely financially independent on my freelance income (I am enjoying this lifestyle for now); I play drums, compose music, and have played gigs and music competitions in Hong Kong; I am fluent in Cantonese (self-taught) and literate in Cantonese and Written Chinese (self-taught), Italian, and Latin; and I have starred in two movies that were shown in theaters in Hong Kong.

So, as you can see, it’s not that I haven’t been doing anything with my life or that I don’t try hard when I’m interested in something. I have lots of life goals and things I would love to do, but I just don’t know how to apply those goals towards making money or furnishing a career. I also feel like I don’t have the resume for jobs that I would like, e.g. translator, music producer, language scholar. Furthermore, whenever I give a career path considerable thought and then decide on one, I get derailed a few weeks later and begin to seriously doubt my choice.

As I’ve aged, I’ve noticed that my interests generally center on language and music. But, as I said above, I have no idea how to translate those interests into career goals. (I have no problem, however, translating them into personal goals, like learning a new language, composing a song, etc.).

Certainly one of my hurdles is my wide array of interests and hobbies, and I’m not terribly sure about how to categorize them into “things I like/do for purely for fun” and “things I like/do for money-making.” If I’m honest with myself, I have trouble categorizing them because of silly egotistical purposes (“I want to be the world’s best XYZ-er and then everybody will like and praise me!”).

To give you some background info about myself: I went to an arts high school and most of my American friends today are professional artists; I have a BA with honors in anthropology and I’m a member of Phi Beta Kappa; I have an MPhil in ethnomusicology (2 year masters with a thesis defense—they use the British system in Hong Kong); although I’m from the US, I have lived, studied, and worked in Hong Kong for the past six and a half years (I moved here for love, but we broke up); I’ve been financially independent for the past six and half years, and I just started my own freelance business tutoring English and Latin and I am completely financially independent on my freelance income (I am enjoying this lifestyle for now); I play drums, compose music, and have played gigs and music competitions in Hong Kong; I am fluent in Cantonese (self-taught) and literate in Cantonese and Written Chinese (self-taught), Italian, and Latin; and I have starred in two movies that were shown in theaters in Hong Kong.

So, as you can see, it’s not that I haven’t been doing anything with my life or that I don’t try hard when I’m interested in something. I have lots of life goals and things I would love to do, but I just don’t know how to apply those goals towards making money or furnishing a career. I also feel like I don’t have the resume for jobs that I would like, e.g. translator, music producer, language scholar. Furthermore, whenever I give a career path considerable thought and then decide on one, I get derailed a few weeks later and begin to seriously doubt my choice.

As I’ve aged, I’ve noticed that my interests generally center on language and music. But, as I said above, I have no idea how to translate those interests into career goals. (I have no problem, however, translating them into personal goals, like learning a new language, composing a song, etc.).

";2;"You need to eliminate any and all distractions in your environment.

Also it wouldn't hurt to do your work at a set place where the above is the case but also where you haven't associated the place as somewhere you relax or do the things you get distracted on.

You've trained your brain/mind to have a scattered focus hence why  you find it difficult to concentrate or not veer off task at the slightest inconvenience or distraction.

It'll take some time but you can train yourself back up to being able to concentrate and focus for extended periods of time.

Start with 5 minutes, and then 10 minutes, to 15, and keep upping it. 

Also it could be that when you suddenly stop and mess around is a time when you need a break, but the trick here is that you don't take a break doing the thing you spend hours of time on such as YouTube. 

You should get up, go for a walk, fresh air, or just wlak around the place, do some body exercises like squats, jumping jacks, or pushups.

";2;"Do incremental exercises. People with short attention spans and easily-distracted focus levels need smaller and stronger bursts of focus. 

Thirty minutes of focusing on X (wherein X is a school lesson, writing, etc) might be too long for someone like you and that's OK. Try fifteen minutes of focusing purely on X. Use a timer. Create clean boxes of your time.

And like everyone has said this before: Force yourself not to look at YouTube. This truly takes effort on your part.

The constant stream of new information triggers the reward system of your brain. If you are procrastinating by using the internet you need to reflect on why you are subconsciously doing so. Laziness is almost never the real answer. Most people are afraid to fail and it's easier to fail when you don't give everything you've got. ( ' I failed but not because I'm incapable or not smart enough'). Some people procrastinate or use  internet as way to handle stress.
So what's your priority? Trigger the reward system of your brain or do you have bigger life goals like getting a diploma ? 

Ive got a few rules for you 


1. At your desk either you're 100% relaxing or 100% studying . There's nothing in between. Stop sitting at your desk all day not studying but also not relaxing either because browsing is making you feel guilty . Trying to convince yourself that you can check Facebook just one minute ? Nope it's not gonna work.  Make a commitment for a specific duration like : I will study 10 minutes and do not do anything else. If you notice you're getting distracted just get your attention back. Do not open any unnecessary websites. You have to consider them as your worst enemy. This is going to be super difficult but do not check those distracting websites ! If 10 minutes work you can start commiting to studying for a longer time.
2. Take breaks in between study sessions but make a commitment before f.e. I am going to take a break for 10 minutes. This break is guilt free. You do whatever you want. 
3. Use a timer that's not integrated in your phone or PC 
4. Use a blocker for website to use while in study mode 
5. I cannot express more how important it is to make a commitment to yourself and not break it. Treat this like it is the most important thing in your life. Because that one hour you're going to study is the most important thing in your life right now. The only exception is your house being on fire. If you think about something you have to look up later, someone you have to text later write it down on a notepad. 
6. These rules are somewhat based on pomodoro technique. But don't keep searching for the sollution online.  There is no quick easy life hack.  The only thing you do is commit to a time and start battling. The solution is in yourself.

People are so vulnerable around me because they trust me (I try to keep these problems at bay so they still think I am the person I used to be 4 years ago) and it's so easy for me to say something so sharp it cuts their heart. I don't want a time to ever come where I do something like that. I would rather die than hurt another person on purpose. But it's getting harder and harder not to do so. I need to get rid of this darkness.

Please help me. I don't know what to do. How do I let all of this go? How do I become a good person again? I don't want to have these shitty feelings inside me. How do I fix this?

Thank you guys in advance.";4;"First of all, you are already a good person. You don't want to hurt people on purpose, so you are a good person. You are human. Humans make mistakes, they hurt people, and then they have to fix them, is a part of being human. 

You have to forgive yourself. It seems like you think that you don't deserve to be loved, that you are fake, or that you deserve a punishment for being so ""bad"". You aren't bad. You may think that if you forgive all the bad things you did to to yourself and others you aren't going to improve and it will be worse.  You don't have to forget your mistakes. You are learning. Learning is making mistakes and looking at what went wrong and what can you do to make it better next time.
 
Depression and axiety are serious issues and, if you can, looking for help will help you tremendously. But first of all, let it go. Forgive. Stop talking bad about yourself. 

And if you are in doubt about what to do next, think: if your most loved person were telling you all of this, what would you say?

Be strong. You can do it, you are not alone, and you aren't a bad person.

[NeedAdvice] How do I work towards becoming a better person?;t3_7vdc3v;3;"problems outwards:
too aggressive, always reacting instead of truly listening and thinking, closed off and not allowing anyone in, gossip, nosiness, cruel, incompetency, lack of a good heart.

problems inwards:
depression, constant self-inflicted stress and pressure about the future, selfishness, distrustful, unkind, ignorance,  escapism,  bitterness, lack of kindness towards self and others, stuck in my head, self-destructive, self-hatred.


I tried to kill myself last week. I'm 18, I've been depressed for the last four years, prior to that I was this sweet nice naive happy girl who wouldn't hurt a fly. Now, I have the issues I wrote above, amongst other problems, like horrible sleeping schedule, bad eating habits, etc etc.

How do I fix these things? When it comes to physical problems like not drinking enough water it's easy to just make a spreadsheet and mark things off and I know I can fix these things. But how do I fix my mental health? These are the demons I keep inside me and it's only getting harder and harder to keep everything inside of me. I don't want to hurt people. I want to be a good person. It's the only reason why I'm still here, maybe I can offer something to the world. People are so vulnerable around me because they trust me (I try to keep these problems at bay so they still think I am the person I used to be 4 years ago) and it's so easy for me to say something so sharp it cuts their heart. I don't want a time to ever come where I do something like that. I would rather die than hurt another person on purpose. But it's getting harder and harder not to do so. I need to get rid of this darkness.

Please help me. I don't know what to do. How do I let all of this go? How do I become a good person again? I don't want to have these shitty feelings inside me. How do I fix this?

Thank you guys in advance.";4;"I'm so sorry you feel this way, and I'm glad you're okay. Please don't hurt yourself again, and please talk to a professional about how you're feeling, if at all possible. With the way you feel right now, it may seem like real change is impossible--I know first-hand how stuck depression can make you feel--but things really can get better; you just have to keep going, taking small steps one day at a time. If you do this consistently, you'll be amazed at how radically your life can change.  

I want you to forgive yourself. Its clear that you feel really badly about yourself right now, and I think those inner problems are definitely at the root of the outer problems that you describe--when you can't be kind to yourself, it's very hard to be kind to others. You might be helped by loving kindness meditation. Compassion is a skill you can develop, and learning to recognize and dismiss the kind of negative thoughts you describe would help you feel more peace in your daily life. 

It can also be really helpful to get outside your own head. If you can, try to take a daily walk and/or volunteer somewhere in your community. Exercise will give you mood-elevating endorphins, and doing something for someone else will help you feel better about yourself and your place in the world. If you can, spend time in nature and with other people who are positive and have your best interests at heart. Contact with the natural world and positive social interactions may help you shift your outlook.  

We all say and do things we regret; it's okay to apologize to anyone you've hurt and then just forgive yourself and move on. Many of us judge ourselves way too harshly, and we can get so wrapped up in our own negative thoughts that we lose all perspective in life. Be kind to yourself. Forgive yourself for being imperfect; we all are! Those nasty messages in your head might seem like reality right now, but they're just stories you're telling yourself about who you are. You can change the narrative. 

Whatever you do, don't try to change everything in your life overnight. If you expect to make an instant 180 and ditch every bad habit and negative emotion, you'll inevitably fail and beat yourself up for it. Instead, try to make slow, gradual, improvements, focusing on small, manageable goals. Go as slowly as you like, and just accept setbacks and move on from them. Celebrate every small victory. This problem took more than a few days to develop, so it will take some time to solve, too, but that's okay. No matter how slowly you go, the whole trick is just not to give up. I know you can do this.

Pick the absolute easiest task you can recall having started -- something you're sure you can make some measurable progress on before you get bored -- and make that progress. Then write it down. Then pick something else you've started, and take the next step on it, and write down that accomplishment too. 

The secret to all the fields of CS is that there's really neat stuff not only on the cutting edge of each one but also in the intersections between them. If you build skills in both graphics and cybersecurity, for instance, you could do fascinating data visualization or crypto acceleration work that few other people in the world would have the background for. But you only start meeting those really neat intersections if you stick with each main field long enough to gain some proficiency at it... and it sounds like you're bailing out before reaping any reward at all for the time you've sunk into a thing.

What you're going to do to eliminate it within a week is baby steps. First, watch less than an hour on your first day. Continue cutting your watching time up to your second day.

Control it up to the point you reached the seventh day without repercussions.

Your imagination will still run wild for some time with the stuff you see in porn but masturbating only to your imagination will break the habit of searching for it on the computer.
Also i highly recommend also cutting off completely the sexy/erotic images for some time so no sites with sexy women images  , just masturbate when you get the urge to go to such site.

[Need Advice]To listen or not listen to your body?;t3_82e5n3;5;"I usually wake up at 9, I have a bad habit of staying in bed for another hour. I am fighting that habit by applying a more strict alarm time for 7 (I'm a postgraduate student with my own schedule, so 5am isn't my goal/necessary atm), I started last week with an alarm of 8.30-8 and 7.30 yesterday. Everything seemed fine but there are some challenges, like I seem to be in a constant fight or flight mode making it hard to sleep at night, or I live in Scotland so it's really dark and waking up doesn't feel natural to me yet(lots of excuses basically). This morning was hard, tiredness from the previous days, restless nights from the weeks before, and even menstruation made me really feel like I need to stay in bed longer. 
My question is, is it right to 'listen to your body' and rest, or fight the urge because it's part of forming the new habit? And if you are fighting a cold, menstruating, or even resting from a long run from the previous days; how much time is best to give yourself to sleep in?
PS. Any advice on making it easy to ACTUALLY wake up, be my guest.   ";4;"What do you think makes you go into fight or flight mode before sleeping?

Should look at what you do leading up to bed and instead implement some kind of evening ritual you can follow through with that will help you calm down and be in a better state of mind to ease into sleep.

Perhaps light reading, journaling, meditating, a bath/shower or anything that helps and allows you to rest.

A big one is to avoid electronics at night if you can because they are very stimulating, also exercising close to bed time can boost up cortisol levels inducing fight or flight mode

Try to sleep earlier if you need to, if trying to set a new wake up time its best to stick to it as much you can, otherwise you can do incremental changes, so set alarm 15 minutes earlier wake up from when you would normally wake up.

Do it for 3-4 days and if it's okay, then push it back another 15minutes so and on so forth until you get to the time you want to wake up. (Helps a lot too to make sure you still get enough sleep/rest)";3;0.75;[[0.95710752]];[[0.63136543]];-0.5579;0.087;0.792;0.121;0.9478;0.134;0.8190000000000001;0.047;-0.121;0.058338038772821385;0.25475341651812244;-0.19641537774530105

PS. Any advice on making it easy to ACTUALLY wake up, be my guest.   ";4;"Several possible suggestions:  

Are you physically tired in the morning, or are you physically awake yet don't want to get out of bed? I find that when the first thing I need to do in the morning is something I'm dreading, even if I'm not tired at all I still want to stay in bed, but if I plan on doing something I enjoy first thing in the morning, even if I'm physically tired I get up right away. Try putting one of your favorite activities first on your schedule. I also use one of those alarm clock apps that senses your movement and tries to wake you up when you're sleeping lightly/already stirring (think mine is called SleepCycle).     

If on the other hand you are physically tired because you're not getting enough sleep, try to address that along with the wake-up issues. Are you going to bed early enough? Are you too stressed to sleep because you're working right up till the moment you go to bed? Could you add some non-school related reading time into your evening schedule, or meditation, or use a blue-light blocker on whatever electronics you're looking at in the evening? Are you working in your bedroom next to your bed, and associating that space with stress (if so can you work in another room or a coffee shop or a library?)  

I've always had problems falling asleep and sleeping through the night, I do all of the above when I can. Sometimes I can't, especially the no-work-right-before-bed rule gets broken from time to time. Sometimes fun gets in the way too.

PS. Any advice on making it easy to ACTUALLY wake up, be my guest.   ";4;I'm not sure I subscribe to the idea that you've got to wake up at 4:30AM and work out to be a productivity machine. You have 24 hours in a day...if you sleep for a good amount like 8 hours, you're left with 16 hours in the day. Whether your 16 hours is from 9AM to 1AM or 6AM to 10PM, it shouldn't matter if you optimize your time. This should be easier especially if you're a postgrad student. Some people are night owls and some are early birds. Within reason, I would focus on doing what your body needs. At the end of the day, waking up early is about discipline. If you have a good routine of waking up at 9 everyday, I think you should stick with it.

If you WANT to create the Habit fight the urges and get up. You may feel like sh°°. It will go on for 1 day, 1 week maybe event a month but eventually your body will get used to it and the habit will consolidate.

Any advice?;461;"Dear fellow redditor, you have to trust me that this problem is so severe on me it almost ruined my SAT exams. We were given three weeks to prepare and I slacked a third of it. 

The problem arises due to ""addiction"" to doing stuff. I can throw an educated guess and say you get distracted easily and/or are on your phone a lot. Trust me, I am the same. 

Here's what I did: I went to a local library. They have this quiet room where talking is strictly prohibited in order to give people a peaceful place to study. Take a book with you, something completely unrelated to your work and just sit there. I bet you havent actually felt bored in a long, long time. 

By this point, assuming you dont have your cellphone in your pocket, start reading the interesting book. At this point, congratulations. It's a downhill run from there.

I hope I was at least somewhat helpful. The trick is to readjust brain from easy dopamine bursts of cellphone to bigger, scarcer dopamine doses that come from achirving stuff. It only takes one successful time. Also, start to actively seek what you've done right during your day, dismiss the slacks. One or two days of slack doesnt give you an excuse to stop trying.

Many sutides have already shown that our productivity peaks at maybe 6 hours a day if it's creative job.

I mean, not being able to wrok even for 1 hours is definitely far below anyone's biological abilities and I struggle with awful work ethic too, but you gotta be a realist. If you can't work 1 hour, work at least for half an hour and if you get ""momentum"", just continue as for another 30 minutes.

Edit: Also, don't compare yourself to people outside of your current league. We all have to start small. And don't even compare yourself to those who are on a similar level to you either. Maybe here and then, just for orientation reasons, so that you know that what you are doing is not completely stupid. But shift your focus onto what you want, on what you are doing, and on how you are doing compared to your own realistic expectations. And keep your focus on those things. Don't get distracted or discouraged by those who are achieving the results now you wish you would be having tomorrow. You may be years behind on them on investment and experience.

[Need Advice] I cant bring myself to care;t3_8438wp;3;I go on and off about being fit and motivated and then just not caring anymore. I went from overweight to six pack and the entire package in a few months, but I'm starting to not care anymore. It's starting to feel like an endless cycle of not caring, then feeling motivated, but it never lasts for long. My grades will start doing better but then drop because I lose interest. I'm unhappy with my life, and I know that I need to change it for my future happiness, and I know I could easily do it if I tried, but I can't give enough of a shit to try. It really feels like the only thing that gets me motivated is exercise, but even then I need to be in a special mood to do that. Apologies if it sounds like I'm just whining, I'm just trying to explain my feelings. (I'm not even really sure I have a right to be complaining lmao, I know there's millions of people starving to death or having much worst problems than me);4;"First of all, **fuck you** for trying to degrade your own personal struggles. I apologize if that came off as extremely rude, but it needed to be said. The situations of starving millions have absolutely nothing to do with your current circumstances. They're physically starving, and you're mentally starving. Just because one sounds worse than the other, doesn't mean you get to write off one for the other. You're both hurting, and that's the ultimate truth. You both need help/guidance. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've struggled with a lot of the things you're struggling with now, so I can understand and empathize with you. Before making my gradual shifts towards self improvement and productivity, I was always that guy that would set up goal after goal for himself. Working out, exercise, dieting, studying, reading, meditation. You name it, and I was probably trying to implement it into my life. One of two things always ended up happening. 

1. Either I'd get a plan set up, a routine or schedule that I'd want to start following for myself, and come the next morning, I wouldn't move. All that motivation was gone and I couldn't be bothered to get started until later that day. Later that day would continuously come until before I realized it, it was already late in the afternoon, and by then, I didn't have time in the rest of the day to see everything through. I'd feel bad and promise myself that **tomorrow*, I'd get everything started. Repeat the cycle. 

2. I'd get a plan started, and would actually stick to it for a bit. Maybe a couple days, maybe a week or 2. If I was lucky and persistent, I could even stretch out a month or so. However, I always managed to hit some emotional wall, without fail. Something would happen that would throw me off my game. I'd slowly lose momentum in my goal, and eventually, I'd revert back to my initial starting point, feeling emotionally drained and lost all over again. In these cases, I'd think to myself that I felt even worse than when I started. 

&amp;nbsp;

If either of these two scenarios sound like you, then I have some great news for you. As someone who's battled through the two, I've found something that worked. I'm just a normal guy, I've had my successes, and I've had a lot more failures. I'm not some genius or special prodigy gifted to the Earth. I'm a regular guy with a desire to improve. If you're also a regular guy with a desire to improve, which through my eyes, it seems like you are:

 &gt;  I'm unhappy with my life, and I know that I need to change it for my future happiness, and I know I could easily do it if I tried.

Then you to can improve yourself. What you're going to need are 3 key factors in your life to reach this improvement within yourself. Those 3 keys are: **Mindset, Responsibility &amp; Persistence**. With these 3 keys integrated into your life, you'll gradually improve yourself until you look up one day and are surprised with the amount of progress you've made. You may not even be totally conscious of the improvement, because if you're really focused on persistence, improvement will become second nature to you. 

&amp;nbsp;

**MINDSET** &gt; ""I can't bring myself to care."" 

Your mindset isn't in the right place. How do you feel about yourself when you wake up in the morning? Are you happy? Are you sad? Maybe even neutral? Your mindset, and how you view yourself, affects your productivity. If you aren't accepting and loving of yourself, then you aren't going to care enough about yourself to change anything about yourself, whether you're happy or unhappy about your current circumstances. How do you view the world around you? Is it shitty? Is it beautiful? Maybe it's a mix of the two? Your mindset also affects your view on people and things. If you've got a positive mindset, you'll search for the positive things in life. If you've got a negative mindset, you'll focus on the bad things in life. If you're neutral, or just don't care, then you'll be in a wandering state, leaving your opinion and views up to whatever you focus on for the day. Change your mindset, and you'll begin to notice that **everything** changes. The best recommendation I can give you when it comes to altering your mindset is what I did, which was watch YouTube videos. I pulled up podcasts and motivational videos and consistently listened to those videos. 

&amp;nbsp;

**RESPONSIBILITY** &gt; ""I'm unhappy with my life, and I know that I need to change""

Responsibility is both the foundation of a self improving and self sabotaging person. If you accept responsibility over yourself and your actions, then you'll be able to achieve things those who don't accept responsibility could only dream of. In accepting responsibility over yourself and your actions, you also need to accept the fact that outside yourself, there is nothing you can control. You can't control other people, and you can't control other things. Everything outside of yourself is outside of your control, so it's also outside of your responsibility. That said, don't stress so much over external factors so much. As long as you do everything that **you** need to do to improve yourself, that's all that matters. Everything in your life is decided upon by your decisions, and if you make good decisions, you'll have improvement and progress in your life. If you make bad decisions, you'll have regret and stagnation in your life. Both outcomes are a direct response to your actions, and are entirely your responsibility. That said, it's good that you've noticed that you have a problem. You're unhappy, and you know you need to change. That's the first step. 

 &amp;nbsp;

**PERSISTENCE** &gt; ""but even then I need to be in a special mood""

Do you ever wonder how successful people seem so full of inspiration and drive to see their goals through? Have you ever wondered what allows those driven to success to keep going against all odds, and regardless of what people say to them? It's persistence. Now, what does that mean? Everyone has persistence in their life. You have persistence to take a shower, brush your teeth, put your underwear on first, your persistence is what you've become accustomed to doing your whole life. The reason you seem to be so off and on with improvement, is because you've been in a negative state for a majority of your life up till this point. Persistence is simply doing something over and over again, and when you do something over and over again, that action or task becomes a habit. It becomes second nature, to the point you no longer need to think about it anymore, you just do it. That is the secret to success. When you try improving yourself, you're implementing a new system into your life that you're not used to. Your current habits will fight to remain while you're working on replacing them. While those old habits fight, you'll come across resistance in your mind. You'll want to take a day off, take a break, put things off till tomorrow. The list is endless. The secret is to push through anyway. Push through until your new habits become the old habits, and before you know it, you'll be doing those new habits without thinking. They'll have become **second nature** ";8;2.0;[[0.96590074]];[[0.64617844]];-0.6275;0.19699999999999998;0.58;0.223;0.9974;0.145;0.762;0.09300000000000001;-0.07799999999999999;0.08577097505668936;0.053175990675990666;0.03259498438069869

Unfortunately, most people think that the normal way is to allow oneself to feel upset when upsetting stuff happens.  Some even insist on the right to feel upset.

Nope, they just get better at feeling upset, which means more upsetting memories get stored in brain until feeling upset is simply predominant.

If you are up for going to the library regularly, just make it part of your routine and get stuff done there. Home can remain a place of respite and entertainment. 

This is actually exactly what I did in college. All of my work got done on campus and my apartment was purely for relaxation.

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to get better at doing productive things at home and have a place you can isolate as a ""productive"" environment (a room without electronics is pretty ideal) I would suggest starting small and just trying to make it into that area and read 1 paragraph every day.

You can always do more, but just try to get in there and practice avoiding all the easy temptations your home has to offer you on a regular basis.

Anybody got any advice on how to kick this bad habit?;15;"Similar thing is happening to me. I think this is mainly for two reasons. 

First, I think being in a library can have a big influence on our desire to read the same way being in a bar makes us want to drink beer or being in a sport's store makes us want to start jogging. Libraries are cool environments that encourage interest in reading. 

Second, I think I like the idea of reading, but often lack attention and willpower to actually read. After all, reading can be effortful at the attention level when just starting. Also, the rewards from reading arrive later compared to tv, games and similar stuff.

I would suggest the same thing other posters did. Stay longer at the library to get some extra motivation or try to get some ""library vibe"" in your own room. In either case, this is just a starting point, because starting to read habitually may demand the same effort that starting some other habit does (for example, exercise).

[NeedAdvice] How do I stop myself from being overwhelmed by my schedule, and find more time for family/friends and hobbies?;t3_7voby4;3;"I'm currently in my senior year of college, last semester. I'm a full-time student. I'm also doing an internship. From Monday through Thursday, I'm up at 7:00AM and don't usually get home until 7:00PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 9:00PM+ on Mondays and Wednesdays. I also have classes on Fridays, though it's only two and I can handle them. Weekends are completely free. I know compared to others who work full time and go to school, or have multiple jobs, it might seem like no big deal, but to me, it's my first time dealing with it, and it's fairly stressful to deal with (senioritis?). I guess it's the fact that all my free time and all my busy time is chunked together, so I'm just constantly looking forward to the weekend.

I feel like I spend so much time at work, at school, or doing homework, that I don't have time to decompress as much as I would like. I usually get home and just feel exhausted and want to be alone. But at the same time, I want to spend time with my family (who I live with), and see my friends and boyfriend. To add to it, I would really like to make time for hobbies. Currently, I only really read or game, but it's not something that happens often. I'm also struggling with finding hobbies that I enjoy, both because I don't really know what I'd like, and because I wouldn't know how to start. I also spend entirely too much time on Reddit just ""passing time"" between classes or briefly at home in the morning and at night. 

My last concern is on how to eat more healthy and exercise and be hygienic given the time constraints. It's much easier to blame the schedule, and not do anything, which is what I've been doing. But I want to be healthier, so something's got to change.

I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to essentially manage my life, because I'm pretty clueless right now. Thanks for reading, and please don't hesitate to ask for my information. I'm willing to do anything it takes to work on myself and be better. &lt;3";11;"I have some experience with this in a few ways. I used to be a teacher and I would regularly work 14+ hour days--leaving for work at 6am, finishing at 2pm but continuing working at school or coming home to work until around 10pm. I also currently work at a university as an advisor for undergraduate students, so I help students with very busy schedules like yourself and connect them with resources.

One thing I'd suggest is listing out everything you have to accomplish in an average week (example: Mon-Fri, I work 9-5. On Fri, I have class from 4-6pm. I have to read 2 hours in preparation for that class..etc etc.)

What I did was list everything out, then assign time frames to each thing. How long will each thing take me? Then, what day and times each week will I do this thing? For example, if you have approximately 3 hours of homework for your classes, what day and time will you work on that? Will it be one hour per day Monday, Tuesday, Thursday? Will it be 3 hours on Sunday? 12-3pm? 9-12pm? etc. Map it all out in detail.

Here's the part that sounds less fun, but is necessary: structure everything, even the fun stuff. Schedule gym time, tv/relax time, etc. It can be a motivational tool to get the non-fun stuff done. (If I don't do my homework from 12-3pm on Saturday like it says in my schedule, I won't have time to go out to dinner with my boyfriend at 6pm, for example.)

It kind of takes all the guesswork out of it. You just always know what you have to be doing and when so that everything gets done and nothing falls through the cracks. 

I don't want to discourage you from taking up hobbies/exercise/etc., but be realistic about the time you have. It's just for this semester, so your time right now looks different than it will in the future. Don't try to fit in EVERYTHING, then get overwhelmed and stressed because you can't accomplish it all; it's like setting yourself up for failure. Work out your weekly schedule, and look at what time you have left. Do you want to add more things into that extra time, or do you want to keep it as ""flex"" time that's unstructured?

I would also encourage you to seek out resources at your university that can help you with this. Most schools have counseling centers, learning support centers, etc. that offer fantastic resources free of charge to students. For example, our learning support office runs seminars/appointments to talk about time management. It could be really helpful!

(PS: For the healthy aspect, consider meal prepping. Lots of resources for that and it's a life saver when you work full time--prep it all on whichever day is most convenient for you, then have grab &amp; go food at least for your lunches all week so you avoid making last minute unhealthy choices.)";4;0.36363636363636365;[[0.96487181]];[[0.65013659]];0.991;0.157;0.789;0.054000000000000006;0.9948;0.13;0.83;0.040999999999999995;0.014000000000000012;0.15697635697635698;0.1160983102918587;0.04087804668449831

Weekend is play.

There's no trick unfortunately you just have to get used to it. Over time you'll adapt and figure out what you can get away with. Who you have time for and what you really enjoy.

Only recently have I started doing things on weekday evenings, but I turn to people and make it clear if I'm busy. If they get bitchy about it then... what? Im supposed to change my entire career/future over someones mood? No. Deal with it.

[Need Advice] Organization in University;t3_85u2km;2;"I started University this year in Germany and I really fucked up my first Semester. 
During the Semester I did the bare minimum if not less. I didn’t go to all the lectures and I didn’t even bother studying at that time. 
That led to me starting to study far to late and not passing the first exam. After the exam I had only one week to prepare for every other exam which is obviously not enough.
So I ended up taking 2 of my 6 exams this semester and failing both and with that losing one try each. I have one written and one oral try left for those exams. If I fail my last 2 attempts I get blocked for that exam and I´m not allowed to take it ever again. 
The other 4 I skipped which means that I don’t lose a try but I still have to take them at some point in order to get my major.
 I´m not sure if it is the same in other countries that’s why I try to explain my situation the best way possible.
I have around 4-6 exams in each of the upcoming 5 Semesters ahead of me. I need help to organize and structure my “Unilife” so something like this never happens again.
I have to learn how to manage my time so I can start studying during the time I have my lectures, how to really study intensely for one topic and how to generally structure my day and life in University.
I hear of people who pass all their exams of a Semester and I honestly can´t understand how people manage to study that much.
 Tl;dr: I fucked up my first Semester passing 0 exams and need help to structure my school life.

I just want you to know that I understand what you're going through. The struggles are real, but they're more common than you think--humanity is remarkably unoriginal. It sounds to me like you are going through depression, even if you don't necessarily recognize or feel it. I've experienced the whole ""life is a drag"" and still fight it from time to time, and I know it sucks. This subreddit is full of tips for getting it together. Physically, you need to take care of yourself, your environment, and your mind. Your body is precious. It carries your life with it. Take care of yourself. 

Just breathe. You're going to make it.

You're never going to change yourself unless you make the conscious decision and act on it. Force yourself to do things that are good for you. I bet you can identify some helpful things that you aren't doing. Well, the only way to find the willpower is to ABSOLUTELY FUCKING FORCE IT. Chunk down the tasks that you need to finish. I wouldn't say ""I can work out for an hour"", but say ""I can do pushups for the next minute. Then I'll rest for a minute. Then another minute of pushups."" Ad infinitum. You don't have to fight forever, you just have to make it through the next minute. And you have all the tools to make it through that minute, I know you do. And if you can survive one minute, I know you can replicate it. You're stronger than you feel. So just breathe... you're not alone. =

Reading posts like these, believe it or not, gives me hope. There is a lot of good left in people like you and me. We just can't see ourselves. I want you to try focusing on the good in the people around you. It's a little inspiring to realize we're not monsters after all. We're people.

A few years ago, I got so bad I would be super anxious leaving the house and get panicky over physical exertion of any kind.

If you only know one thing, know this: You are worthwhile. You are capable of and worthy of happiness, peace of mind, and love. Don't give up hope. No matter how shitty life gets, there is always hope for a better tomorrow.

The number one piece of advice I have is to start as small as you can and do those small things daily. For example: Wanna get out the house more? Go for a 5 min walk everyday. Wanna stop being socially anxious? Talk to someone everyday, even if it's your friend. You're welcome to message me to talk. Wanna get some exercise? Do one pushup everyday. Wanna spend less time online? Spend 5 mins purposefully offline everyday. From those smallest of starting points (you can use my examples or think of your own), slowly build upon them over time. 1 pushup turns into 2, which turns into 3, then 4, then 5, then OVER 9,000!!!!

Remember I said I used to fear leaving the house and physically exerting myself? Well, by starting small and slowly increasing things, I eventually got to a much better place. In fact, this past Sunday, I hiked to the top of a small mountain and hiked back down (3.5 hours in total, 1,640 ft elevation, 2.6 miles). Now, I feel energized to go further and higher.

You can do it, man! We're all rooting for you here! You're not alone!";2;0.11764705882352942;[[0.97511584]];[[0.63972182]];0.9746;0.185;0.687;0.128;0.9734;0.16399999999999998;0.747;0.09;-0.017000000000000015;0.07372442372442373;0.0779140423126615;-0.00418961858823777

Few things I'd recommend you focus on, start journalling pen and paper (yes you can go digital if you want but I recommend pen and paper, there is a difference imo).

Just write everything out that goes through your mind, imagine it's a conversation happening between your past self and your present self. And just vomit on the paper unfiltered all the thoughts, feelings, emotions, events you've been keeping to yourself and hash it all out.

Make this a daily habit, it doesn't need to be long at all, 5 to 10 minutes can suffice.

In your first session though its possible you might go a bit longer because it seems like you've been holding a lot of stuff back. Aside from having someone to actually talk to about all of this, this is probably the best alternative.

In regards to the other stuff, make sure you got your basic life fundamentals locked down.

I'm talking exercising every day or second day, sleeping right, eating right, and meditating.

Just pick one of those along with journaling to get you started and keep at it for at least one, two, or three weeks or however long it takes for you to solidify them

If you can muster up the courage, talking to your parents about the arguing/fighting and the effects it is having on you could also help you out a lot";2;0.11764705882352942;[[0.97129665]];[[0.57717205]];0.9746;0.185;0.687;0.128;0.9781;0.11;0.8759999999999999;0.013999999999999999;-0.039000000000000014;0.07372442372442373;0.0424225245653817;0.031301899159042024

It is the light at the end of your tunnel. However, unless you are desperate to get into Oxford or some top-tier graduate program, this is simply not true.

How many employees at any given company do you think graduated summa cum laude? Except for some crazy industry like Wall Street, the number is low. Even people who graduated magna cum laude are fewer than those with cum laude, which are fewer than those with no honors at all. If employers demanded all applicants to have graduated with highest honors, there would indeed be very few people with a job.

I ""only"" graduated cum laude, and then I went to get my masters. In academia, after you get a masters, it's not that important what your undergraduate grades were, because you have already demonstrated an ability to perform higher level work. What matters is your thesis, the conferences you attended, and the people you know.

I am assuming you want to become a librarian, since you want to study library science. Why don't you contact the library staff at a number of instutions and ask them what their thoughts are? I'm sure they will be more than happy to provide guidance to such a promising and hardworking student who wants to enter their field :)

Also, for what it's worth, have you considered working or studying abroad? If you are considering a PhD, it may prove beneficial to get your masters outside of the US.";3;3.0;[[0.95565274]];[[0.56571645]];-0.8056;0.106;0.758;0.136;0.9834;0.168;0.7859999999999999;0.046;-0.15200000000000002;-0.08381313131313133;0.21090062111801244;-0.2947137524311438

So since you realized that your life is less stressed by having a task block in your moleskin notebook, I'd say that you should get back into that. Is it just you don't wanna be hyper-planned out? I'd say it's worth it if you can get shit done. Trust me I get the same way at times wanting to be ""looser"" with things but then I swing back realizing I get more done.

I would choose like “morning routine”. Then you define what you want to be included in that and then you can focus on completing the group as a whole. This will build the same habits but without the pressure of tracking every single one and thinking you are failing. Also, if you skip a little part of it because you are having a conversation with your partner or what not, I think it would be reasonable to still mark off morning routine completed. 

You can apply with with a nighttime routine as well.

Legit. If only you knew. 

It's so interesting. I was once in your place, and I'm not even sure what I would have told myself. Two completely different minds. What I can tell you is 

1. Read self-development books 

2. Implement small and gradually move onto bigger 

3. Learn to pick yourself back up as quickly as possible 

4. Have hope

5. Stay open-minded and question your beliefs 


This will heal you and give you the life you deserve. Also, get neurofeedback treatment. It's responsible for 25-30% of my healing.  Reduced anxiety, more confidence, more clarity, less mental fog. Easy and no side effects, almost too good to be true. Could be a bit expensive, if you don't have insurance. Also, i'd stay away from medicine, anti-depressants are fraud. Here's a study about antidepressants: 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172306/

I have a file of 20 more studies about depression, anxiety medicine etc. being placebo. They do more harm than good. Lmk if you want the file. 


Really, it's all about if you put in work. If you put it in, you'll get a good life. ""You get out of life what you put into it"" - Ben Carson 


Also, some very critical books you need to read: 

- Success principles, Jack Canfield (Life principles that will give you profound results applicable to all areas of your life - success, wealth, relationships, health) 

- Power of now, Echkart Tolle (How to heal anxiety, depression, negative emotions and live peacefully) 

- Psychocybnertics (How your mind works to achieve the things that it wants. Lots of practical advice) 

- Think and grow rich (A self-development bible)

Hey, OP, get back here!  You and me - we are going to sit back relax and make a little fun at the scaredy cats treating you like an outcast.

My family rescues way way too many cats, so there maybe more cat metaphors.  Yes, scaredy cats - you're so much a loser that they can't even dare being seen talking to you.

(lazy grin at you)  Yes, you're a loser.   Accept it, cause we gotta kill a lot of pride (extra sticky neural wiring) to get out of stress pits we not only fell into, but dug up (and then fell into).

Actually, you did kill some pride by posting about your problems in the first place but... I bet you were hoping for a bit more karma than this, right?  Maybe triple digits, two digits.

Never mind about the fucking karma.  It causes more problems than solutions.  Even the ones who get so much karma are going to end up way too distracted by the karma to really actually apply.

I'm an oldie.  I miss the old internet days when there was no likes, karma and only the goddamn view count to worry about.  Heck, I'm still convinced my decade long writer's block erupted because I ended up being too concerned about getting votes.  It took finally internalizing that to set my writing bunny free.

Don't worry - word count trumps karma AND... money is even better, better than any virtual point system.

And you've got family who cared enough to try to force you to work.  Do me and yourself a favor - please call them, ask them for help.  C'mon, kill that sticky pride.  Ask your family for help.

Most disciplined-successful folks have a supportive family as a major asset, OK?  Heck, only yesterday did I realize that my family is the real reason for more than half of my success rate.

I have written down goals and a lot of plans over the past few years but I never seem to truly work on them besides the initial part when I was motivated to write it down and begin that very day. Motivation videos become dull to me very quickly and I find myself losing to myself when trying to rationalize doing a goal. 

What can I do to fix myself? I don't want to keep going the path I'm going on. I wish I could take a drug like NZT-48 and reach what I set out for myself but I can't...";4;"Your story actually sounds very similar to mine. 

First off, you're not broken. You just learned a certain way of being. Humans are a creature of habit, and you have created certain habits. In order to transform that homeostasis, you must change what the homeostasis is. 

First off, research ADHD. See if the research resonates with you. I learned that I had it late in life, and it changed my life.

Second, habits. Don't expect all or nothing from yourself, if you've been taking it easy forever, that will scare you off. 

Two small things that have had huge results for me:

- Clean your space. Organize it, get rid of anything you don't need (if you haven't touched it for two years, you probably don't need it). Environmental upheaval does wonders for a sense of possibility. Keep that shit tidy and clean. Clean space is a clean mind.

- Commit yourself to meditate for 10 minutes every day for at least 60 days. And I mean COMMIT to it. Every day, and it will do you wonders. Keeping yourself accountable with physical evidence, I recommend checking into https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/

Start in small, reasonable steps. One thing at a time my friend. :)";1;0.25;[[0.97636554]];[[0.56114784]];-0.6279;0.08;0.818;0.102;0.9794;0.17600000000000002;0.7929999999999999;0.031;-0.16699999999999998;-0.0911706349206349;0.12983630952380956;-0.22100694444444446
[NeedAdvice] I really need to improve quickly.;t3_830y3z;3;"I'm 19 years old, I'm currently frequenting the last year in the high school (classical studies), currently I'm focusing on getting rid of my phone addiction (shoutout to *r/theXeffect*), but I have to do more. In the following month I will have to pass 4 important exams: the violin final exam, the driving license exam, the first certificate english test and the admission for Bocconi in economics.

The point is not that I don't have enough time to make it possible, it's just that I'm not that motivated, oh well, disciplined. My marks are pretty good currently, 8/10 here is above average, but I feel I don't study enough, I always end up finishing on doing things that really aren't that important (i.e. playing video games and staying too much staring my smartphone).

My goals are currently: breaking up the phone addiction, meditating and doing night journaling once a day, taking cold showers at least twice a week. 
I really struggle already with the first one, because I tend to visualize myself doing all these things in the future but in the end I barely make it. My study routine isn't neither fucked up, I can still have a regular study program on certain days when I feel productive (like 2h:30 of study). 

I'd eventually feel pretty satisfied even just by passing only the university test, but I need to stay strong and find some energy to keep up the work, or better, to start it.
I already thank you all for the support &lt;3";7;"1. Go to waitbutwhy.com and read the two posts about procrastination. 
2. Read them again. 
3. Turn off your phone and internet and computer, unless you need it for your work
4. Study. Do nothing but study, sleep, eat, shit, and shower. You can do 3 of those at once if you’re crafty. 
5. Make your choice now: Do you want to live a happy life or a sad life? It’s a very easy and simple choice. One life consists of thinking long term and the other short term. Long term thinking means that your rewards will be great but they won’t come for a few weeks, months, or years. But the good thing is, once you get over the first hump of working hard without reward, once that first wave of rewards begin to show up they’ll keep coming forever because you’ve been working on those long term pleasures for so long. Meditation is a perfect example of long term. You’re not gonna notice anything substantial for maybe a month. But once it hits you...booooy you become a superhuman. 

Short term thinking, on the other hand, leads to a life of fucking shit. You’re constantly chasing immediate gratification but you’re never really satisfied. You always need to be playing a game, watching a show, surfing on your phone, listening to a podcast, listening to music, reading reddit, jerking your little dick to porn, on and on and on, and when you stop and look around you realize you haven’t DONE anything, you haven’t worked for anything, haven’t built anything. You’re just constantly feeding your brain what it craves but you’re not getting any real enjoyment. 

This kind of thinking is why people become addicted to drugs and alcohol. 

So decide right now. Do you want to be happy or fucking depressed and broke and unhealthy and sad and just a real waste?

Hopefully you won’t respond because you will have deleted your reddit account and never come back to this website. Hope I don’t hear from you.

I already thank you all for the support &lt;3";7;"Phone addiction is actually quite simple to destroy, if you yourself are willing to go through with the hard part. Basically - get rid of your smartphone all together, and get a cheap prepaid phone for calls. If you are unwilling to do this, I would reset your smartphone back to factory settings to get rid of all the apps and social media notifications you got going on. As long as you maintain self control, refuse to reinstall those apps, then your good to go.

Meditation is just a matter of starting. My suggestion is to do a 10-20 minutes session in the first hour of the morning. Use a phone app if you decide to keep your smartphone like Calm or Headspace to help you get started.

On your last hour of the day, before you go to sleep, spend time away from technology and do pre-sleep rituals. This can include journaling, another meditation session, or visualizing your goals (or all 3). I highly recommend visualizing your goals before going to bed.

Personally, I don't really think the cold showers are necessary unless you have a really hard time getting up in the morning, but personally, having the alarm away from my bed to where it forces me to get up to turn it off and then exercising immediately after I think achieves the same effect. 

Hope some of this helps! Good luck!";2;0.28571428571428575;[[0.96732644]];[[0.54683655]];0.9876;0.165;0.797;0.038;0.9513;0.10800000000000001;0.853;0.039;0.058;0.10660561660561664;0.07886363636363634;0.027741980241980282

Take care of your personal hygiene and get on a sleep schedule. Master that for at least a week or two and then slowly give yourself more to do.

The way I made changes was to start with one ting at a time and for me it was a regular sleep pattern. Getting sleep down for 3-5 days and marking that off as a goal you've achieved and then another 3 days and then another. What I found also worked really well was to make a list of just 5 things that I wanted to change, and they shouldn't be big things. But 5 small things that made everyday life easier. Tidying the space you live in, cooking your meals, regular sleep patterns and connecting with close friends were mine. I focused on sleeping and tidying my room at my mum's house (where I was at the time). I then moved on to making my meals regular and after a while went out once a week for a walk with a friend. 

You're at least in a place where you realise you need to add structure to your life. That mental roadblock is one of the hardest parts to change. Just focus on little things you can achieve and you'll go from there. Don't make it all too big and set yourself up for failure. 

Btw I still have my piece of paper from my original 5 things, I keep it in my office and every morning when I get in, I know if I have had some good sleep, had breakfast, my apartment is tidy(ish) and that i have seen a friend in the last month then I am doing well. It keeps as a reminder that if nothing else, you've done the 5 small important things you defined for yourself.

He hates it. He musters up the courage and strength to make it up 1 hill, but he lays down at the top. Then a guy who runs every day comes up and says this:


It gets easier. You just have to do it every day.


Everything is like this in life. Think about it. If you eat like shit every day it's just easy to do that every day. It's hard to think about what to eat that's good for you. If you play video games all day then it's super easy to just play video games. You're not thinking about what else you could be doing in that moment. It's just like the gym and trying to better yourself - it's hard at first, but it gets easier. You just have to do it every day.

I think that taking it one step at a time is a great idea for a lot of people and the way I handled everything isn't great for my future. However, I feel 100% better about everything after taking a break and then kicking my own ass. I feel in control of my life, my choices, and my future now way more than I did before.

And once you can do that thing, add another one.

I'll share the advice my friend's mom gave. You just have to do one more thing than you have to. You went to the kitchen to get a sandwich? Then your one extra thing might be wiping the counter before you go eat. You went to put your plate in the dishwasher? Good job, your one extra thing might be to load the rest of the dishwasher.

One extra thing meets you where you are. We all know what it's like to be too daunted by an onslaught of ""I need to do this and that and that and also this and this and this too and AAAAAHHHHH screw it I'm just going to sit here and watch more Netflix.""

So you have no hobbies, learn one.
You don't like your body? Either lose weight or buff up, pick one. (Working out = hobby.)
So you don't have friends, get out and make one.

But don't panic over the whole freakin owl, just pick one work on it. Like you're not SOL, you're not a black hole, you're not even close to the event horizon. It sounds more like you started running the race, realized that running was stupid and jogged back to the sidelines to watch. The black hole is WAY further into the race, when you no longer had the stamina to make it back to the stands with your parents. You know you're not an idiot, and you know your feelings about being a failure are only feelings and they're not true and they don't have to hold you back.

It's GOOD that you're having these feelings now instead of twenty years from now. From here, you have a chance to defeat the Huns and be a man.";6;0.03278688524590164;[[0.9571961]];[[0.67118234]];0.8957;0.18100000000000002;0.7020000000000001;0.11599999999999999;0.6444;0.084;0.848;0.069;0.04999999999999999;0.010944264069264052;0.03977272727272727;-0.028828463203463214

“I applied to a lot of jobs today, way to go.”

Literally, that’s what it took. I had to start somewhere because everything felt insurmountable and hopeless.

Exchange pleasantries with retail staff, go to a coffee shop every day at the same time and say ""hey"" to the people working there, write soft core porn for kindle (it's short and if you're good at it, profitable). Once you start working again, you are never going to have this much free time again. Go to the library, learn something: origami, drafting, knitting. Projects! Projects! Projects! They will get you out of your funk. 

Also, don't judge what you want to pursue. If you think you might like learning to pipe flowers onto cakes, do it! Maybe you want to draw bridges, or weird little towns, IDK.

You’re not that bad off it just seems like you lack motivation and drive to do things. Fitness is something that helps me get the energy to do things so what you can do is set up a few minutes of your day to doing body weight exercises (push ups, sit ups, squats) and the  increasing them by five every other day. On days you don’t do them go for a walk or run. The small changes in physique and routine helps change the way I see and approach other things in my life so maybe you can apply that to yours.

 I dropped out of college when I was 21. I then spent 2 years at a government trade program called Job Corp where I earned my A+ Certification in IT to be a computer repair technician. Afterwards, I joined the military and quit about 7 months in, realizing I was only doing what people expected me to do rather than what I wanted to do. I am now 26 years old, with a now expired A+ Certification, no college degree, and living paycheck to paycheck. Its been more than two years since I left the military. Starting in January I weighed 254 pounds at 5'11. After realizing that I was going to get nowhere unless I did something, I made radical changes to my habits and overall lifestyle.

Its only been 3 months since I made that decision, and things have gotten way better. I now weigh 230lbs (thats over 20 pounds in a few months) with my goal to be 175lbs by June. I stopped eating fast food and soda completely. I get up at 4:30 every morning, meditate, and exercise every day. I've taken this entire month...and I do mean, this entire month to visualize and clarify my future, deciding in one years time I will take a trip to Japan and live there for 6 months. By the time that happens, I will have a stream of money coming in from passive income through my writing and my online business of freelance web development. A skill in which I have invested $300 so far in learning since January.

Point is - through action alone, I have radically changed my perspective and outlook on life. I stopped feeling sorry myself and resolved to do something about it, coming under the understanding that I am complete control of my habits and my fate. Am I successful in my goals yet? No, I just started, but that is what matters. I STARTED. And I sure as hell not going back to that blackhole of mediocrity that I have been raised to believe that its okay to be in.

I have learned so much within the past 3 months through action, reading, and studying the behaviors of successful individuals. I'm no life coach, but there are a few things I can suggest that will help get that motor started. It will be up to you on whether you continue or not.

1. Go to bed early and get up in the morning early (I think would 5 be a good time)
2. Exercise immediately after getting up/Or, if your into meditation like me, meditate AND THEN exercise
3. Make your bed
4. Write in a journal 4 things.  ---10 Affirmations---Your dream that you wish to accomplish---The most important things you need to get done today---10 things you are grateful for---

Do all these things in the morning. Motivation, as I have found it, is a myth. You don't need motivation, you need momentum. And you build that through action. That momentum carrys you throughout the day and as you keep doing it, you become naturally a more actionable person.

Honestly, I have learned so much about self improvement in the past few months that it is absolutely mind boggling how many info I have learned and applied to my life to make my life seem so different than it was last year. And if this feeling of progression, of success just in sight can be achieved by me, then it can be achieved by anyone with even an ounce of self discipline. You just got to know the tricks. For example, make sure that in order to wake up in the morning, set your alarm all the way on the other side of the room. Don't have it next to you. I'm a light sleeper, so I have to get up and turn it off, and once I'm on my two legs, then thats it. I'm awake. That is how I avoided sleeping in constantly, and now its starting to become habitual. One time my alarm didn't go off for a certain reason, but I still woke up at the same time and got up anyways. 

So try to rig the game. Rig life in order to best mold you into the best version of yourself you need to be. If you start now at 23, with a constant focus on learning and bettering yourself, you'll probably be fairly successful when your 25 or 26. I know I'll be that way in a few years as well, at least that is what my subconscious is now beginning to tell me.

Hope this helped somewhat.

Think of something harmless that you just really dread doing and force yourself to do it.  Yes, it will be unpleasant.  Accept that.  Get used to it.  The human brain is a weird place - it's really bad at keeping track of happiness over long time scales and figuring out which actions led to which types of happiness.  So we find ourselves drawn to activities that deliver pleasure in the short term because then we feel like we can see the causal relationship better.  But the reality is that, for example, exercise causes you to be happier in general over the long term.  It's just that the causal link isn't obvious so we have a tendency to drop it because in the short term it's uncomfortable ;1;0.005464480874316941;[[0.93187984]];[[0.6070001]];0.8957;0.18100000000000002;0.7020000000000001;0.11599999999999999;0.8805;0.14300000000000002;0.763;0.094;0.016;0.010944264069264052;-0.039473684210526314;0.05041794827979036

Often, our stress comes from having unrealistic perspectives on work, self-improvement, relationships, goals, etc.

There is no one-size-fits-all plan that will help you become disciplined and improve your lot. But a great place to start is with deep self-reflection. What kind of person are you? What are your dreams? What motivates you? What are you good at? What do you suck at? Where do you want to be in the next year? The next 5 years? The next 10 years? Write all of this down in as much detail as you can so you can get it out of your head and see it all written out. This shouldn't take long--like maybe a couple hours tops--, and it's important, so don't think of it as a waste of time. Once you have a good grasp of these things, you'll be able to make better decisions about which discipline strategies work best for you.

If I could tell my 23 year-old self one thing, it would be to spend at least an hour everyday working on a craft that comes naturally to me and that I enjoy (in my case, it's drums, in your case, it's growing hot peppers and making sauces and jams). After 7 years (I'm 30), that not only adds up to a lot of hours (~2,500), which is necessary for increasing skill, but it gives you daily stability and happiness when life sucks.";2;0.28571428571428575;[[0.97148991]];[[0.68378454]];0.9406;0.126;0.8270000000000001;0.047;0.9399;0.11800000000000001;0.84;0.040999999999999995;0.002000000000000016;0.1779304029304029;0.1997863247863248;-0.02185592185592189

[NeedAdvice] How do i make myself stop being a bitch and confront my bully?;t3_88a0id;7;"I am stronger than him and larger than him but i'm a fucking coward.


He is a psychotic son of a bitch with huge ego but he's super weak and plays video games all day. The thing is, i am not very popular at school and he has more friends on his side.


He stated trash talking me on my class's group and i called him out to stop with his shit and if he wants to trash talk me he can do it in private messages and not in front of everyone and emberras himself. He actually went and started saying things that he thinks make me insecure and insult. I told him to stop being a bitch and if he wants to say something to me he better say it in person, i was really angry. He said that he will today, i just have to say place and time but he says it has to be close to him.


I would just ignore him but this is more than dealing with one asshole in my life. I have let people walk all over me my whole fucking life because i am a coward that can't confront people. I plan on meeting him and just punching him in the face but i have never actually done that, i can fight , he can't, he has turned people against me this whole year and when i asked him why he is doing that he said ""because you're a piece of shit and you're annoying and no one likes"". I don't mind the insults, but he's going out of his way to make my life shitty and he won't stop until i finally fucking do something about it.


He thinks that i want to talk to him and that he'll just have a laugh because i saw him on street yesterday and asked him why he's doing this and he just started shit talking me and i didn't do anything.


I need to fucking stand up to people that give me shit for their own amusement. How the fuck do i force myself to actually go there and hit him? I know i can beat him, if you think that it is cowardly fighting someone weaker than you, i am not doing this out of pleasure. How do i actually make myself go there and do it?

It depends what you're willing to compromise. Ask yourself what's in it for you?

You can make this guy's life a living hell just the way he has done to you, if you try hard enough. His friends will leave him. People will turn on him, you can subtly fuck him until things are pretty shitty for him. But that takes a lot of dedication. I hope you're not out to get him, that's a little unreasonable (even though he's made life bad for you)

If you want him to leave you alone, start acting with confidence. I've been bullied before; sometimes, if you go along with it instead of ""standing up to them"", they'll lose interest. You can change what they do to you to twist it in your favor.. as my sensei said, ""he goes over, you go under, he pushes, you pull.."" kinda makes sense? You can deflect what he's doing to you if you're both confident and humble enough. He might stop. And if he doesn't...

If you're determined to use physical violence, first you need to control the situation. Give him fair warning before you kick his ass. If you hit first without warning, everyone in the situation will see that as you being the bully. You don't want that. Say something like ""leave me alone you big bully""--cheesy, but the use of the word ""bully"" is actually very powerful. Make it clear to anyone around that HE is the bully in this situation. You're only the ""victim"". Give him verbal warning that he's going to get his ass kicked. Make it clear. And if he persists in whatever he's doing

Don't be afraid to get hit. Throw away your fears. Seriously, if you're too scared to get hit, you shouldn't have posted this. When you're actually in a fight, getting hit doesn't hurt badly; your adrenaline masks the pain. Your energy is poured into inflicting maximum damage. If you can just throw a scare into that dude, you probably won't even need to go that far. But once you use physical force, make sure you're prepared for the consequences. One of which is, if your bully doesn't scare off when you fight him, things could get a lot worse--just be careful. Is he picking on you just to cover his low self-esteem, or does he geniunely hate your guts? Know your enemy before you go to war!!

That aside, this does need to stop. One way or another you need to prove that you can't be walked on; if you let yourself wallow in that mentality, it really gets to you. So if it comes to kicking ass, by God kick his fucking ass!!!

Also it’s important to model healthy behaviours to your kids. If they don’t see you valuing your health, they won’t value their own so it’s a long term decision.

Babies are great because if you set them down somewhere, they are there when you get back. Also if you lay out a fitness mat you can do crunches, push ups and squats while they goo goo gah and past 4 months when their visual acuity improves they love watching you move around especially if you’re talking to them while you do it. 

As toddlers, get a lightweight umbrella stroller and rip around the block with them randomly. They love surprise, short distractions. 

I think you can find ways to incorporate your supervisory responsibilities into a fitness routine of some kind if you’re creative and it will not just benefit you, but your kids.

As they age, honestly, kids just want to be doing whatever you’re doing. You have built in workout buddies now. Also, kids crave and thrive on routine and discipline. Creating a schedule that matches their needs with your tasks is totally possible. My son struggled with developmental delay and it rarely stopped me from getting things done or self care and I think the challenges we solved together have improved his issues tenfold.

";145;"1)  Every time you feel anxious - Do This:

* Notice.  Be **AWARE** that you are getting anxious.
* (pause)  Stop whatever you’re doing.  Blank out your mind for a bit.
* **BREATHE** deep long slow until you are -
* **CALM**

ABC - Aware, Breathe, Calm.

This is basic Meditation.  Yes... you can do meditation anywhere.  Doesn’t require sit down to get it working for you in a snap.  Just keep doing this, so you can gradually train your brain to associate anxiety with ABC.  Keep it up, and it will become AUTOMATIC.

FYI, there are at least 10 stages-levels in the Meditation Tree.  Most people get stuck at Stage 3.  Those who get to Stage 5 become fans, because that’s where the magic happens.

Next, Proper Posture - basic Strength Training.  This can become AUTOMATIC, too IF you do NOT resent having to do it.

";145;"As an ex HR executive my advice is very simple.

Try to think like your new boss and ask yourself:

What is my job really?

Because first you have to understand and make it clear what you really have to do on a daily basis.

Most conflicts and confusion and disappointment are avertible if we know our responsibilities and obligations in advance.

Our new employer usually want to see us as a productive and competent ""workforce"".

This only can happen if we clearly know what is the expectation with new employees within the company.

So don't be shy to ask around, ask for guidance and ask questions without second guessing.

( for example : I will not ask this because maybe I will look like someone who is stupid or not qualified for the position)

My personal experience as an ex HR person is that asking questions and ask for help at the beginning saved more ass in the company than flying under the radar.

Everybody should know they have a new colleague from now on.

So if you feel you are in trouble, just communicate!

It requires some courage but totally worth it!

Think about it!

In the past - I bet - you were in trouble only because you didn't hear your voice enough.

Maybe it's not the advice you were waiting but life experience is more valuable than other theories.

Good luck for you and I believe you will killing it!

";145;"I had the same exact situation recently. My first recommendation would be meditation. It's helped me keep calm and focused while at work, which has allowed me to be a great worker (I'm constantly reminding myself to be at work when at work, focus on the job and leave personal thoughts/feelings at home as best I can) I focus meditate in the morning to clear my head (set timer for 10 minutes, focus on clearing my thoughts and on my breathing) then I reflect meditate on my day for 10 mins at the end as well (what I did at work, what I could've done better etc)

As for the people you're working with, they are you're co-workers and nothing else, your only opinion that you should care about from them is how they see you as a worker. I use to get a bit stressed about what everyone what at work thought or how I looked, I don't care about that at all anymore. I show up to work with a mindset that is ready to be productive and focus on work. 

I would start excercising a little bit before you go to work so you're a little more physically ready for an 8hr+ shift. 

I would also recommend meal prepping for work. Having a solid breakfast and morning routine will do wonders for your mindset before work. Having a decently healthy snack and lunch at work will help keep you focused and energized. 

Hope this helps man, best of luck.";14;0.09655172413793103;[[0.92353116]];[[0.70148665]];0.9645;0.18;0.789;0.032;0.9948;0.221;0.7659999999999999;0.013000000000000001;-0.06;0.13420745920745922;0.275;-0.1407925407925408

";145;"First off, congrats on the new job - this sounds like a step in a great direction. I'm not sure what field you'll be going into, so I can't give too much specific advice, but here's what I've found to be true across several very different work environments:

-Get to know your co workers. Smile, remember their names and positions, eat lunch with them, etc. etc. Fostering those casual friendships will make the workday more pleasant for you, and can really help as far as group projects go. 
-Over the first few weeks, don't be afraid to ask questions if you missed or just don't fully understand important information or need clarification - even if you feel silly or like you're being a bother. (You aren't!) It's best to be honest and ask for help with something upfront, and will (hopefully) cut back on mistakes you'll need to go back and correct later. 

-Be open, friendly, learn as MUCH as you can about the organization (history, policies, upcoming projects) and your co-workers (role, title, preferences, etc.) over the first month or so.

-As far as sleep goes...have you tried relaxing Youtube videos? Like videos on meditation or ASMR? You could try listening to these on your phone as you to go to sleep; it can be tough to unwind and feel relaxed before you're ready, but you will adjust to the new sleep schedule sooner than you think. 

I hope this helped!! Good luck! ";8;0.055172413793103454;[[0.97334012]];[[0.74256181]];0.9645;0.18;0.789;0.032;0.995;0.242;0.6859999999999999;0.07200000000000001;-0.021999999999999992;0.13420745920745922;0.15966291704928065;-0.025455457841821436

";145;"I don't know that it's advice so much, but, just brace yourself for doing nothing the first week, including cooking dinner when you get home. Just... Prepare for that now. Hell, go so far as to get lean cuisines or take &amp; bake lasagnas with paper plates and stuff because it's so exhausting to start a new job. I remember the last time I did, which has been years now, but it was this insane exhaustion. Meeting everyone, being 'up', trying to remember names, all of it. It was so exhausting. I pretty much inhaled food and passed out. Go easy on yourself, it's a shocker. Don't expect yourself to do your workouts that week- if you can, great. If you aren't feeling it, okay. A week of while dealing with a shock, give yourself a minute to adjust. And the rest is back to school basics- Have your clothes all ready (and make sure work clothes still fit... Try them on) the Saturday before, try to rest up on Sunday and don't do much, be showered and have your haircut those days before, have a basic wardrobe plan for the week ahead (always say do your outfit plan the night before, but honestly I went home and face planted into the bed, soooo week before for the first week), and have that put together, figure out how long it takes you to get ready in the morning, and set timers on your phone for different stages of where you need to be in your routine, try to leave the house 5 minutes before you need to leave by- a 5 minute cushion so you can run back in and grab your lunch/briefcase/etc is helpful. Get lunch/snack stuff the weekend before, keep a cliff bar in your bag at the very least. If you don't have a lunchbox, get one then! The basics, just like back to school. Just... remember to plan to be very tired.

I also tend to get anxiety in Sundays because Monday, our impending doom, comes eventually. Any tips to counter this?";9;"**It's foolish to think one can do something he's never done before. It's equally as foolish to think one can stop doing what he's always done.**

&amp;nbsp; 

What does this mean? Let me ask you something. How often have you consistently worked on being productive and active during your Sundays? I understand your desire to be more productive, and I admire the fact that you choose a day to be productive where most would use the day to rest and lazy around, but desire aside, if you haven't made any meaningful action towards that desire, then it's a worthless goal. It'll only ever always be in your head. Something that you constantly wish for, but can never achieve. 

&amp;nbsp; 


So, how do you become more productive? 

**Begin Being Productive**

&amp;nbsp; 

People are driven by what their habits consist of. Meaning, even though you want to make a change within yourself, if your habits consist of something entirely opposite of that want for change, you aren't going to change. The reason for that is because habits are what our bodies and minds have become comfortable with. They are an action or actions that we've done so many times and with so much consistency, that it becomes second nature to us. So then, how do you become more productive during your Sundays? 

&amp;nbsp; 

What you're going to have to start doing is forcing yourself to be productive during your Sundays. Whatever productivity means to you, write it down on a piece of paper, or type it in a word document and print it off. Read it every Sunday morning, and begin acting in a way that adheres to what you wrote or typed down. The first day will be manageable, and the second may be the same, but eventually you'll hit a point where you'll notice you're losing momentum. Thoughts will start to enter you mind: 

- Maybe I can hold off on doing this task.

- I'm pretty tired, I'll just save the rest for tomorrow. 

- I've done good so far, I'll take a little break. 

- This is stupid, what's one day of rest gonna hurt? 

Your mind will begin to think up excuses and reasons for why you should stop. It's doing this because what you're working on achieving here is breaking a routine you've become accustomed to. It's something you've become comfortable with, and doing things outside of our comfort zone is what our bodies and minds have been trained to keep us from. Ignore these reasons and thoughts that **will inevitably** come to you. If you allow these things to deter you, you'll not only be reinforcing your current habits and routines that you're trying to change, but you'll also begin building up a type of defensive mechanism that your body will use as a new routine/habit when you try to break from it. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Now instead of simply trying to break a habit to form a new one, you'll have to work on reaching that point of discomfort, and fight against your mind using those thoughts of deterrent, which have now become a habitual defensive mechanism. For example: 

&amp;nbsp; 

Someone wants to lose weight. Their obstacles are the following: 

- Get up

- Work out

- Eat healthy 

- Ignore self-doubt

- Time

- Profit 

&amp;nbsp; 

Versus someone who constantly doesn't hold themselves to their goals: 

- Get up

- Work out

- Eat healthy 

- Succumb to self-doubt

- Stop working out

- Stop eating healthy

- Repeat 

&amp;nbsp; 

It can easily become a self-sabotaging cycle. 

&amp;nbsp; 

So, to answer your question once more. 

&gt; Why is it that whenever I want to be productive on Sundays, I fail?

Because you've haven't made it a habit yet. 

&gt; Any tips to counter this?

Force yourself through the discomfort of being productive on Sundays until it becomes a habit. Then, it'll be second nature, and you won't even have to think about it.

Cast your vision for who you want to be.  Take this to the very edge of what you think is possible.  Then break that down into a reasonable 3 month goal that would take you a step closer.  Then break that 3 month goal into 2-week intervals of targets that seem achievable.  
Something like this:

Vision: Get back into peak shape, like I was when wrestling.

Goal: In 3 months, be able to run 3 miles in x minutes, and benchpress y lbs/kg.

Targets: Work out 3 days a week for the next two weeks.  

The subsequent 2 weeks, add in 2 runs a week at a comfortable pace.

Etc. 

This builds a roadmap of achievable targets that end in your 3 month goal.  At the end of three months you iterate through the process again.  Start out with Targets and a goal that you are relatively certain you will succeed at, so you can get a few wins under your belt.  Then start pushing harder and stretching your goals.

This happened in January. And now since then I am feeling very sad, demotivated, depressed. My willpower has also depleted. I know that I need to rise up and continue and let the bygone be the bygone and move forward in life... but I now literally have zero willpower to do so... and ocassionally I have memories of that exam and feel sad... so please give me advice on what to do.

Any help is appreciated :)";6;"Let me tell you a story about my aunt and uncle's cat, Puffles.  She is their very first officially adopted cat.  Meaning she is allowed inside their house.  None of the other strays they feed are given such a privilege.  Of course, such a distinction puffed up Puffles' pride, and well... she just lorded over all the other cats over a territory that's about 3.5 households large.  She was the Queen, the Empress even.

Was, cause... the house next door got their own indoor cat.  Then, another house got 2 dogs and a cat.  And more arrived.  Puffles' territory shrunk.  She was upset.  She fought with each newcomer, one by one, tried to take back her territory.  But it was no use.  Then, one day - Puffles wouldn't leave my aunt and uncle's house.  Same for the next day and the next.

""I think Puffles is depressed,"" my uncle told my aunt.  And he was right.  Puffles had been defeated.  She lost more than half her territory and had to go hide to lick (emotional-mental) wounds.  Took a while before she would venture out of their house.  Til this day, she still doesn't get along with the other cats.

Now, why this story I tell you?  Cause THAT is what happens to the more primitive portion of our brain whenever we suffer a significant defeat.  That enjoyable subject of yours and that very important exam which you prepared so hard for - that was your territory which you worked so hard over.  You lost it, and now your inner animal aka Monkey Brain aka the primitive lizard portion of your brain wants to stay somewhere safe, hide and recover.

In JAN 2018, I too had very bad defeat, caused by too much sudden work.  I actually spent about 10 minutes staring at my own hand frozen in mid-air.  No matter what I couldn't make it budge forward to the mouse to work on my emails.  I could do chores, could vent on Reddit, could talk with family/relatives, but work itself paralyzed me.

How we get out of ""I got defeated"" pits depends highly on how we got defeated in the first place.  Obviously, if the reason was something mostly out of our control - it will be easier to recover from, cause it was mostly out of our control.

Any help is appreciated :)";6;"I am similar, losses hurt and make it much harder to continue on with a task. This is what has helped me:

1) Understand that success and failure are not one time events. I started just repeating to myself that the only time I'd truly fail is when I quit trying over again. I've failed big tests in subjects I've liked, heck, I've failed entire classes in subjects I've liked. But I try, try, try again and eventually (one class took 3 times smh) I will pass. As its your last year of high school, things seem final, but maybe you can take the subject at a community college or even an online class so you have another chance to ""win"" rather than the loss you keep mulling over.

2) Understand why you are doing whatever. If this subject is something you like, something you wanted to study further in, something you see being important to your career, then refuse to accept the failure. HOWEVER, if it's something that you don't see as important to your future, then who cares? As in really? No one cares about high school after high school. Don't be so hard on yourself for failing one test in January of your senior year.

3) Meditate. You're caught in a thought loop about this test it seems like. Any thought of attempting something new will be dragged down with thoughts about that test failure. Meditating helps your mind stay focused, and will make it easier to not let past or future events prevent you from accomplishing what you need to do today.

Another thing to think about is leaving high school is a really weird time emotionally. For many of us, it's the beginning of ""adult"" life and the realization that you won't have this nice laid out path anymore. It can be easy to turn that into this is your last chance to get your adult life started out ""correctly"". I had a lot of weird depression, demotivation, and other negative and nihilistic thoughts and feelings that last semester of high school - especially before official acceptance into college. So, this test just might be the trigger for you. Be kind with yourself.

The ""family motto"" I was told (when I failed that class the 2nd time) was ""Don't let the bastards get you down."" That class was hard as sh*t, and I bet your test was too, don't let it stop you from living your life!

Everything else is simply a lesson that you can learn something from.

So if you **truly** want to fail, then you stop here and give up and don't do anything else with or in your life.

But if you don't want to be a failure, then simply reflect back on this experience, realize it doesn't define your life and that you will likely even be laughing back at yourself 5 years from now wondering why you even stressed out so much about it, and also learn from it what you can and move on.

Keep moving in the direction you want to go, just because you failed the exam doesn't mean you failed or screwed up your life.

You could always re-take it or do whatever you need to do to pass the year or simply just take another route to the destination you want to go.

Start exercising, getting out the house more, and work on making progress to something and you'll feel much better.

Good luck and remember, you haven't failed, you only fail when you quit and give up.

So get up. Get out. And keep going.

The guilt primarily comes from the fact that you fear you are not upholding the *outstanding* image that others (or yourself) have of you. On a deeper level, it is likely caused by a fear of failure mixed with perfectionism. Paradoxically, this leads to procrastination because by avoiding the work, you avoid dealing with the imperfections of the work you deliver. 

Considering practical advice, the first and most important hurdle is to start working. It might sound simplistic but the easiest way to start is to ask yourself: ""if I would not feel this guilt and if I don't care about what others think of me, what should I be working on right now?"". This really helps me to start working. The second hurdle is when you feel like you're getting overwhelmed with tasks and worries while working. There it helps to very clearly and consciously decide what to work on. Only focus on accomplishing this small part, the rest you can worry about at a later time.

After that, you can start learning how to love yourself instead of beating yourself up and making yourself feel bad.

You're not doing what you want to do or know is best to do because you feel like shit and are filled with guilt all the time.

There's 2 ways you can go about this:

1. You can work on your behavior and this will help you on the emotional front.

2. Or you can work on your emotions and feelings that will then in turn help you on the behavior front.

Generally #1 is much easier to do...

You can go for a run, do some physical exercise, simply stand up straight and smile the widest smile you could ever do and you will literally change how you feel.

The other trick is to do your homework for just 5 minutes. Simply set the timer for 5 minutes and do nothing but your homework.

Take a short break after, then come back to it and do it again. You might find you're able to do more than 5 minutes and shortly after you'll feel good for having done your homework.

But #2 is how you actually change and eliminate or limit the issue from arising again in the future. They can both go hand in hand, you just need to try it out and see what works.

In regards to #2, a few things that help include:

1. Regular exercise
2. Healthy diet
3. Meditation
4. Journaling
5. Consistent and quality sleep";1;0.2;[[0.97155058]];[[0.65462879]];-0.7831;0.14800000000000002;0.667;0.185;0.9839;0.149;0.8190000000000001;0.032;-0.154;-0.13261496957149127;0.17329545454545453;-0.3059104241169458
[NeedAdvice] Struggling, at 29 years old, with the same fundamental issues as my teenage years;t3_80em3o;7;"I apologize for the length in advance. There is a TL;DR at the end if you need it.

**Some Background About Me**

I came to Canada as an immigrant when I was 5 years old with my family. Mom/Dad both struggled until I was a teenager to keep us above water; because they worked late nights, I had free reign over my eating and sleeping schedule growing up, which meant I ate like shit and slept very late. I’m not sure if that’s played in a part in how I am today, but it sure seems like it since I have the same morning routine at 29 that I did at 14. 

I should note that I graduated from a top university despite all this and received an honours BA and got a high paying job in my field. This is because I have the capability to “hyperfocus” when I need to and put my mind to achieving the core “must dos” (e.g., school, working) that I was taught. However, the other important parts of being an adult (being on time, eating properly, etc.) are skills I just can’t seem to grasp.

**My Identity**

A big part of my identity is that I **constantly feel like I’m underachieving** and that I have to prove/show people how disciplined I am as a person. In my head, I am/have the capacity and ability to be a built smart buff guy with great posture and a disciplined schedule that would make other men enviable. In my head, I believe that this is easily achievable for me *if I tried*. But I don’t really seem to do the things that require me to achieve it.

In fact, when I actually reflect on reality over the past decade, all I really am is a skinny-fat 140 lbs dude who reads Reddit comments and buys self-help books, has poor posture from years of computer usage, boasts average social skills, and can’t commit to an exercise program for more than 2 weeks. Why is this? Why is my mind so disconnected from my actions?

A part of my identity stems from my dad and siblings acting condescending towards me growing up (e.g., they’d put me down if I sucked when I tried at something - like handyman skills for example). The anger and shame I’ve felt from the fear of them laughing at me has propelled me to succeed in a lot of ways, but it also hangs over my head like a cloud that I have to be the absolute best at everything I do. Everything has to be perfect or they’ll laugh at me again.

**Summary of my Daily Issues**

* **I haven’t been able to get to work on time for years**. Despite living 10 mins from work, I routinely show up 30-35 mins late everyday. Our work times are flexible, but everyone is typically in by 9:10 AM. Part of it is that I do well in my role and am known for my work ethic. I’ve gotten promoted twice already despite my lateness so I believe I can get away with it. This was also the case in high school – I always had high grades (when I tried) so I figured I could waltz in when I wanted. This makes me feel really guilty.

* **Every morning is a stressful self-inflicted rush.** I either wake up late, or, if I wake up on time, procrastinate (on my phone) until I’m at the point where I have to rush to get ready. In either scenario, I’m 35 mins late for work. Consequently, I almost always miss breakfast, pick out the first thing I see to wear (often from a dirty laundry pile), look dishevelled and hurried, and generally don’t feel like I have my life together. I feel better as the day goes on and I can fix my hair, etc., but in the mornings, I feel guilty, anxious, judged, and pathetic.

* **Despite success, I don’t know what it means to have my life together:** Again, I was never taught discipline and could do things as I wanted; my parents only really cared if I had good grades (which I often did). As a result, I am good at doing the “core” things I’m supposed to (e.g., getting good grades or doing well at my job), but struggle with basic “adult” things like keeping my condo clean, keeping my finances in order, waking up on time, etc. 

I don’t know what a well-functioning adult is like, tbh, and feel really depressed when I see friends my age who know how to cook, dress, do handyman skills, and wake up on time.

Here’s the thing, I am past the point of being able to blame my parents. This is just who I am and I don’t know how to change. I try to work out, but can’t keep it up for more than 2-3 weeks because I get overwhelmed at other parts of life (stressful job, balancing relationships, etc.). I tried to sleep early but constantly feel like I’m “missing out” on something if I’m not checking my phone every two seconds.

I look around and I see people who “have their life together” – everyone seems to be able to do basic things like wake up on time, look ready/organized at work, and are able to pack lunch and keep a sleeping schedule, etc. I can’t do any of these things and I’m dying to know what the secret its.

**TL;DR:** Struggling with poor eating habits, chronic lateness, procrastination, and waking up rushed since my teenage years. Always did well school and job-wise despite these deficiencies. At 29, still can’t do basic things like wake up on time, pack lunch, or have a daily routine/schedule.

In fact, when I actually reflect on reality over the past decade, all I really am is a skinny-fat 140 lbs dude who reads Reddit comments and buys self-help books, has poor posture from years of computer usage, boasts average social skills, and can’t commit to an exercise program for more than 2 weeks. Why is this? Why is my mind so disconnected from my actions?

A part of my identity stems from my dad and siblings acting condescending towards me growing up (e.g., they’d put me down if I sucked when I tried at something - like handyman skills for example). The anger and shame I’ve felt from the fear of them laughing at me has propelled me to succeed in a lot of ways, but it also hangs over my head like a cloud that I have to be the absolute best at everything I do. Everything has to be perfect or they’ll laugh at me again.

**Summary of my Daily Issues**

* **I haven’t been able to get to work on time for years**. Despite living 10 mins from work, I routinely show up 30-35 mins late everyday. Our work times are flexible, but everyone is typically in by 9:10 AM. Part of it is that I do well in my role and am known for my work ethic. I’ve gotten promoted twice already despite my lateness so I believe I can get away with it. This was also the case in high school – I always had high grades (when I tried) so I figured I could waltz in when I wanted. This makes me feel really guilty.

* **Every morning is a stressful self-inflicted rush.** I either wake up late, or, if I wake up on time, procrastinate (on my phone) until I’m at the point where I have to rush to get ready. In either scenario, I’m 35 mins late for work. Consequently, I almost always miss breakfast, pick out the first thing I see to wear (often from a dirty laundry pile), look dishevelled and hurried, and generally don’t feel like I have my life together. I feel better as the day goes on and I can fix my hair, etc., but in the mornings, I feel guilty, anxious, judged, and pathetic.

* **Despite success, I don’t know what it means to have my life together:** Again, I was never taught discipline and could do things as I wanted; my parents only really cared if I had good grades (which I often did). As a result, I am good at doing the “core” things I’m supposed to (e.g., getting good grades or doing well at my job), but struggle with basic “adult” things like keeping my condo clean, keeping my finances in order, waking up on time, etc. 

I don’t know what a well-functioning adult is like, tbh, and feel really depressed when I see friends my age who know how to cook, dress, do handyman skills, and wake up on time.

Here’s the thing, I am past the point of being able to blame my parents. This is just who I am and I don’t know how to change. I try to work out, but can’t keep it up for more than 2-3 weeks because I get overwhelmed at other parts of life (stressful job, balancing relationships, etc.). I tried to sleep early but constantly feel like I’m “missing out” on something if I’m not checking my phone every two seconds.

I look around and I see people who “have their life together” – everyone seems to be able to do basic things like wake up on time, look ready/organized at work, and are able to pack lunch and keep a sleeping schedule, etc. I can’t do any of these things and I’m dying to know what the secret its.

**TL;DR:** Struggling with poor eating habits, chronic lateness, procrastination, and waking up rushed since my teenage years. Always did well school and job-wise despite these deficiencies. At 29, still can’t do basic things like wake up on time, pack lunch, or have a daily routine/schedule.

";6;"There was a lesson that was taught to me in the service that I carry with me to this day. It was prepare before fun, I use to be just like you man. I had almost the same upbringing it sounds like. One thing I would find before I went in was I would come home from work or school kick off my shoes and start having fun with the mid-set of I worked hard today so I deserve some free or fun time. This is completely false, I am owed nothing, but what I reap. Get off work and immediately prepare of the next day, lay out clothes and pack your lunch. Write a note that you will put on your phone that is now at the other end of the room for your alarm saying something like ""GET UP AND CHANGE"" something to motivate you. Immediately hit the deck and do 15 push ups this will get your blood pumping. I would say make your bed in the morning because it does actually give you a sense of accomplishment. Start using tools to make your life organized Iphone task manger, calendar, etc. I literally have planned out free time for me to just do whatever I want everyday around the same time. This maybe to structured for you so you will need to have some trail and error with it. Start a Vlog of just you talking to the camera for 5 mins about the things you did good today, things you can improve on and what is on your mind. 

Hope this helps. ";3;0.5;[[0.97674188]];[[0.64993763]];0.9976;0.147;0.784;0.069;0.9847;0.146;0.826;0.027999999999999997;-0.040000000000000015;0.0723799603174603;0.0988095238095238;-0.02642956349206349
[NeedAdvice] Struggling, at 29 years old, with the same fundamental issues as my teenage years;t3_80em3o;7;"I apologize for the length in advance. There is a TL;DR at the end if you need it.

**Some Background About Me**

I came to Canada as an immigrant when I was 5 years old with my family. Mom/Dad both struggled until I was a teenager to keep us above water; because they worked late nights, I had free reign over my eating and sleeping schedule growing up, which meant I ate like shit and slept very late. I’m not sure if that’s played in a part in how I am today, but it sure seems like it since I have the same morning routine at 29 that I did at 14. 

I should note that I graduated from a top university despite all this and received an honours BA and got a high paying job in my field. This is because I have the capability to “hyperfocus” when I need to and put my mind to achieving the core “must dos” (e.g., school, working) that I was taught. However, the other important parts of being an adult (being on time, eating properly, etc.) are skills I just can’t seem to grasp.

**My Identity**

";6;"This is a lot like me! Yay. 

What works for me:
Morning. Getting out of bed: My feet have to touch the floor within 5 min after I wake up. I know from yesterday that it is not so bad to get to the shower. I can do 1 min, 2 min then with 20min it gets easy. I might have felt bad some mornings, and it can give me a fear that it is horrible to get up (burned kid fear fire).   

Tip two. Food. I choose to follow 1 guideline from a cancer association on recommended diet. It could also have been heart association. That is my only guide in what to eat, and I learn that. This means cutting back on 1000 food tips from the internet etc. and stick with one! Crazy tip, no more development for my food regiment. 

You can read Harriet Learner on overachieving and underachieving. E.g. her book on the dance of fear or dance of relations I think its called. Your father might be a dominant father, and you are the little brother?

I came to Canada as an immigrant when I was 5 years old with my family. Mom/Dad both struggled until I was a teenager to keep us above water; because they worked late nights, I had free reign over my eating and sleeping schedule growing up, which meant I ate like shit and slept very late. I’m not sure if that’s played in a part in how I am today, but it sure seems like it since I have the same morning routine at 29 that I did at 14. 

I should note that I graduated from a top university despite all this and received an honours BA and got a high paying job in my field. This is because I have the capability to “hyperfocus” when I need to and put my mind to achieving the core “must dos” (e.g., school, working) that I was taught. However, the other important parts of being an adult (being on time, eating properly, etc.) are skills I just can’t seem to grasp.

**My Identity**

A big part of my identity is that I **constantly feel like I’m underachieving** and that I have to prove/show people how disciplined I am as a person. In my head, I am/have the capacity and ability to be a built smart buff guy with great posture and a disciplined schedule that would make other men enviable. In my head, I believe that this is easily achievable for me *if I tried*. But I don’t really seem to do the things that require me to achieve it.

In fact, when I actually reflect on reality over the past decade, all I really am is a skinny-fat 140 lbs dude who reads Reddit comments and buys self-help books, has poor posture from years of computer usage, boasts average social skills, and can’t commit to an exercise program for more than 2 weeks. Why is this? Why is my mind so disconnected from my actions?

A part of my identity stems from my dad and siblings acting condescending towards me growing up (e.g., they’d put me down if I sucked when I tried at something - like handyman skills for example). The anger and shame I’ve felt from the fear of them laughing at me has propelled me to succeed in a lot of ways, but it also hangs over my head like a cloud that I have to be the absolute best at everything I do. Everything has to be perfect or they’ll laugh at me again.

**Summary of my Daily Issues**

* **I haven’t been able to get to work on time for years**. Despite living 10 mins from work, I routinely show up 30-35 mins late everyday. Our work times are flexible, but everyone is typically in by 9:10 AM. Part of it is that I do well in my role and am known for my work ethic. I’ve gotten promoted twice already despite my lateness so I believe I can get away with it. This was also the case in high school – I always had high grades (when I tried) so I figured I could waltz in when I wanted. This makes me feel really guilty.

* **Every morning is a stressful self-inflicted rush.** I either wake up late, or, if I wake up on time, procrastinate (on my phone) until I’m at the point where I have to rush to get ready. In either scenario, I’m 35 mins late for work. Consequently, I almost always miss breakfast, pick out the first thing I see to wear (often from a dirty laundry pile), look dishevelled and hurried, and generally don’t feel like I have my life together. I feel better as the day goes on and I can fix my hair, etc., but in the mornings, I feel guilty, anxious, judged, and pathetic.

* **Despite success, I don’t know what it means to have my life together:** Again, I was never taught discipline and could do things as I wanted; my parents only really cared if I had good grades (which I often did). As a result, I am good at doing the “core” things I’m supposed to (e.g., getting good grades or doing well at my job), but struggle with basic “adult” things like keeping my condo clean, keeping my finances in order, waking up on time, etc. 

I don’t know what a well-functioning adult is like, tbh, and feel really depressed when I see friends my age who know how to cook, dress, do handyman skills, and wake up on time.

Here’s the thing, I am past the point of being able to blame my parents. This is just who I am and I don’t know how to change. I try to work out, but can’t keep it up for more than 2-3 weeks because I get overwhelmed at other parts of life (stressful job, balancing relationships, etc.). I tried to sleep early but constantly feel like I’m “missing out” on something if I’m not checking my phone every two seconds.

I look around and I see people who “have their life together” – everyone seems to be able to do basic things like wake up on time, look ready/organized at work, and are able to pack lunch and keep a sleeping schedule, etc. I can’t do any of these things and I’m dying to know what the secret its.

**TL;DR:** Struggling with poor eating habits, chronic lateness, procrastination, and waking up rushed since my teenage years. Always did well school and job-wise despite these deficiencies. At 29, still can’t do basic things like wake up on time, pack lunch, or have a daily routine/schedule.

What would you would recommend for something like this? Is therapy the way to go at this point?



";6;"Just pick one behavior and work on changing it slowly and surely.

Whether it's including one fruit a day to eat in your diet, or making sure you are at least not 5 minutes late etc.

From there you can increase it more and more.

The thing is a lot of us are ""stuck"" because we identify with these stories and experiences we have gone through in the past and we build these 'solid' identities we have of ourselves.

E.g. you believe you eat poorly, are chronically late, procrastinate a lot, and not a morning person or have troubles waking up.

The thing is, the stories and experiences all did manifest from somewhere.. And they manifested from your past **behaviors**.

So there are two ways to going about making 'permanent' change in yourself and how you act, you either completely change your identity i.e. do it from a mental perspective/thought standpoint or better, you change your behavior.

Once you start noticing and seeing your change in behavior, your mind will start believing and associating that you are this new person and overtime this thought will only get stronger and stronger, just as it did in the past for the current identity you hold over yourself.

So the key is to start small, stay consistent with it, and then slowly increase it over time.

So for the diet, you could just eat one fruit a day, do that a few days or a week, and if you succeed then add another fruit.

Then perhaps you can add a serve of veggies or whatever until you  have overridden your poor diet with a relatively healthy diet, then you can tackle your other behaviors such as timeliness, waking up, procrastination etc. ";1;0.16666666666666669;[[0.98662464]];[[0.54058643]];0.9976;0.147;0.784;0.069;0.9403;0.08;0.899;0.021;0.01899999999999999;0.0723799603174603;-0.008522727272727277;0.08090268759018758
[NeedAdvice];t3_82bvqb;3;"Starting next week is spring break for my college getting 2 weeks of. In that time I want to change my entire lifestyle. I’m moving back to my small hometown and hoping to start seeing a little bit of change. I’m not bringing anything to game on while I’m home to try to stop my gaming addiction but I want to do more.

College has had me stressing with anxiety and feeling depressed, it really took toll on my grades causing me to not care as much and now I’m sitting at a 2.0 at midterm. Another struggle I have is sleeping, for the past 2 weeks I’ve been having to take sleeping medicine to put me to bed before 2-3 am and I keep waking up drowsy. The third thing I want to change is my fitness, I have a gym membership at my college but every time I go I feel like I’m doing stuff wrong and looking stupid. 

Sorry if this is long, confusing, and have a lot of grammar mistakes but I just want to start changing my life and not be so much as a bum. 

Thank you for any advice ";1;"By far the best thing you can do is exercise. Don’t worry about what others think of you that are in there, to be honest most ‘experienced’ people in the gym love seeing ‘beginners’ in the gym and would never laugh at you. The only reason you should care about it is because of your form and hurting yourself. Watch a couple videos on YouTube before going to the gym and implement it when you get there. You will build your foundation. 

For the 2 week break, set a couple goals for yourself this break. I usually like to set goals that cover different areas in life so a fitness goal, career/school goal, relationship (SO, family, friends, etc), self development, so on.

Thank you for any advice ";1;"&gt; Starting next week is spring break for my college getting 2 weeks of. In that time I want to change my entire lifestyle. 

First things first, I want to commend you and congratulate you on the fact that you're wanting to change your life for the better. That desire you feel to change is going to help you achieve grand things in life. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I hate to say it, but I've got some bad news for you. That statement of yours that I highlighted, it's not going to happen. I'm not trying to bring you down or destroy your confidence in change, I'm trying to give you a hit of reality before you begin on this journey. You aren't going to change anything too seriously in these next 2 weeks. You definitely aren't going to break or create any new and positive habits in these next 2 weeks. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, what? Does this mean that you shouldn't even try if 2 weeks isn't enough time? **Not at all!** These 2 weeks you've got for spring break aren't going to be the 2 weeks you change your lifestyle, they are going to be the 2 weeks you started the journey towards self improvement. Now, I feel I should explain to you why it is that you aren't going to be changing anything dramatically in these 2 weeks. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Firstly, you've got too many goals. You want to better your academics, quit a gaming addiction, work on your fitness and fix your sleeping schedule. All great things that will greatly improve your life if handled correctly, and I don't mean to say that you having all these goals is a bad thing. I'm only saying that you have too many goals to change in the span of 2 weeks. 

&amp;nbsp;

-  Secondly, I have no clue how old you are, but since you're in college, I'll assume you're around my age. 19-22. I don't know your background or history, but am I right to guess that you didn't grow up with a large amount of discipline? I'd assume if you did, you wouldn't be here asking for advice in the first place. That being said, and if held true, means that you're going to start doing things to yourself that your mind/body aren't used to. You're attempting to break bad habits that presumably have been with you your entire life. Those aren't things you can simply will away just by wanting them to change. It takes time and dedication to break a bad habit, and only after that, can you replace that habit with a different, hopefully more productive and positive habit. 

&amp;nbsp;

-  Lastly, it doesn't seem like you have the proper mindset to begin truly tacking these goals you've got in mind. You mention that college has taken a mental tole on you, and because of that, your attention towards your academics fell. I can completely understand this, as I went through something similar my Sophomore year. I actually ended up failing 3/5 classes, though miraculously didn't flunk out of school thanks to my GPA Freshman year. Anyway, these types of goals require a certain type of mindset to be seen through. You say you didn't care as much about your academics because of the depression and stress, but lets be honest with ourselves here. You did as bad as you did because you chose not to put as much effort as you could have into your academics. There were probably times you were faced with a decision to study vs. gaming/partying/sleeping/procrastinating/etc. Those decisions weren't lead or altered due to stress, those were decisions you consciously made. **Own up to them!**

&amp;nbsp;

Alright. I'm done beating you down. Time to pick you back up. 

So, what is it that you'll need in order to see these goals and changes through? You'll need 3 key things to improve yourself in all these fields:

1. Mindset
2. Plan
3. Patience 

&amp;nbsp;

**Mindset:** Easily the most important factor in changing your life. You need to develop and maintain a proper healthy mindset towards these goals and yourself. You're going to have days where you don't want to work on changing these habits. It's going to happen. I guarantee you it's going happen. **I bet my life right here and now, it's going to happen.** Discipline, motivation, drive, passion, all these things will help you push past the want to slack off, but your mindset will keep you focused when all those other things fade. **How do I develop a positive mindset?** I can only recommend to you a way that allowed me to adopt a positive mindset. **YOUTUBE!**Yes, I'm serious, type in positive mindset in the search bar and watch those motivational speaker videos. Listen to what they say and notice how the things they teach come in line with your own life and lifestyle choices you've made. If you're willing, read about it through Google, it's up to you. I'd recommend this video here to start off with: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iVH5LVRBHU 

If you've got a positive mindset, you can achieve anything. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Plan:** You've got your goals down. Academics, gaming addiction, fitness and sleep. Awesome! Now you need to write down a plan for how you're going tackle these separate issues. Write down the issue you're having in all fields. Ask yourself and write down why you're performing at the current level you are, and write down the answers that come into your head. Once you've got those written down, now ask yourself how you can improve in all fields and **write it down**. Write down whatever comes to you and be serious about it. If you can't take writing your thoughts over these things down, you will not take seriously the effort necessary to act on changing. Once you've got the ways you can improve, start implementing them into your life slowly. You're beginning huge change in your life that you aren't used to doing. You're not going to be studying for 4 hours without fail tomorrow on to the rest of your life. You've got to implement gradually and slowly grow the habits you want for yourself.

&amp;nbsp;

**Patience:** I don't mean to keep bringing this up, but it's important with this final point. You're not going to change yourself in 2 weeks. It's simply not going to happen. **BUT**, what you can do is begin the process of habit creation and begin planting the seeds of improvement that will inevitably create the habits that you're wanting to implement in your life. You want to improve your academics, start by studying your best/worst subject for 10 minutes. Just 10 minutes. This is important: **Document how you feel before taking on those 10 minutes. Afterwards, document how you feel again and reflect on the difference!** The hardest part about doing something is getting started, at least, that's how it works for me. I used to put off things so often because I'd work up in my head the amount of struggle and exertion I'd give to see that task through, only to start, finally, and realize it wasn't nearly as bad as I was making it out to be. However, I'd always forget this simple fact, and would continue doing the same thing the next day. Document how much you don't want to study, how tired you feel and how much of a waste of time you know this is. Then, shut everything up and do it anyway. After those 10 minutes, document how you feel now. Any difference? 

&amp;nbsp;

Change and growth takes time, but if you have the tools necessary to see them through, and the patience to allow them to grow naturally, you'll be rewarded with long lasting productivity and improvement. Take these 2 weeks of your spring break and begin on the road to self improvement. 

All the best. :)";1;1.0;[[0.93375844]];[[0.57306032]];-0.9598;0.086;0.755;0.158;0.9991;0.14800000000000002;0.794;0.057999999999999996;-0.162;-0.11874999999999995;0.04687796771130105;-0.165627967711301

That fear you're feeling right now is very little different than what a trapped animal feels.  And that's because the more primitive part of your brain is really like an animal.  Let's call it your inner pokemon.

Now, this concept is old as fuck.  Very old.  The Bible even likes to call most people baa baa sheep-les.  East Asian mytics call it Monkey Brain.  Scientists call it lizard brain.  Motivational folks like to talk about unleashing our inner animals.

Thing is your inner pokemon is very frightened right now.  It feels trapped.  BUT... it feels worse than you, cause you YOU - rational human being - just know that your parents will just get mad at you.  Maybe yell at you.  Maybe ground you.

Your inner animal, on the other hand, thinks it's about to get eaten.  See, this is why FEAR feels fucking horrible, because the root cause of FEAR is getting eaten a.l.i.v.e.

As for studying, everyone has their own tricks. Personally, I like to listen to calm, somewhat repetitive music without lyrics, chew gum, and get a bit of caffeine beforehand. The music and gum are non-distracting distractions, while the caffeine helps me stay alert and focused. I also find that being out in public helps, probably because I subconsciously believe that people will judge me if they see me wasting time rather than studying.

[NeedAdvice] I'm really close to losing my degree. Why do I self-sabotage myself like this??;t3_83o6i7;7;"This post is hard for me to make, this the first time I’ve ever unloaded 100% like this. 

I've been on this downward spiral for three years now. I'm in my 3rd year of electrical engineering and things are BAD all around. Socially, academically, and health wise. As of this year I have failed 9 courses, my GPA is 1.7, I’m very overweight, and I can't seem hold on to a friend. If I keep going down this path I may be forced to withdraw next year. 

I don’t know what it is with me but I don’t ever step up to the goals I set for myself. Even trivial things take a lot of effort. It’s like I don’t even care. Every time I have a huge assessment, I start doubting myself and I get consumed by this fear of failure. Just thinking about it would make me feel so anxious I end up procrastinating to avoid the feeling. The result? I either panic and study last minute or even worse I succumb to this weird “all or nothing” mentality and I don’t bother showing up. Coming to lectures sucks too, when I do come I can’t keep up with what’s being taught so I end skipping and try self-study to catch up. If skip for too long I get too ashamed to come back because by profs give me disapproving looks (I’m one the only black people among my classes so I stick out like a sore thumb).

When my academics slip, everything I’ve built up with it slips away too like a domino effect. I can’t focus on extracurricular activities I involve myself in because I’m too worried about my grades (Makes for a pretty bad resume). My weight loss regime gets tossed out the window, my social life takes a dip along with my confidence, and all my hobbies are shelved. It’s a sequence that repeats itself time and time again! I’VE HAD ENOUGH. I want to change, I want to make progress, I want to be happy, I want balance. So why am I like this?? Why can’t I stay motivated? When I write it out like this it seems so obvious what needs to change. So why can’t I believe in myself? 

What really baffles me is that I was almost the opposite of this in high school. I had a very active social life, played sports, I had confidence, and I even had the highest average of my grade (I needed to an 90+ average to even get into this program). I know the change from high school to University is big, but this really feels like something else. It’s like I’ve fallen, and I can’t get back up. I’m sorry for rambling so much but I have to know. What can I do to be a better me? Can I even bounce back enough to get job in this field when I graduate?
";51;"Reading your story is heartbreaking for me. Mainly, because I was going through the same thing you're going through now, and I can honestly say that I'm in a much better place. That said, I hope what I share with you today can truly help you understand yourself a little more, and ultimately help you achieve great things for yourself. 

&amp;nbsp;

What you lack at this point and time is a proper mindset towards yourself, and life in general. What I mean by this is that your views on things are properly tainted with negativity and self doubt most of the time. I get this assumption mainly from your explanation of skipping classes and missing lectures. Boy can I say from experience that I understand all that you stated when it comes to feeling ashamed and scared to show up to a class that you've missed 4 days of in a row. I empathize with your setbacks in fitness, academics and social life, as I was in the same position 3 years ago. Lost and oblivious as to how to change it all around. 

&amp;nbsp;

The first thing you need to realize is that you're constantly failing because you've developed a habit of complacency. You've gone through your current lifestyle for so long, that it's something that you're used to doing now. It's why you have days where you suddenly wonder, ""Why am I failing like this? I'm not happy and I want to change."" You'd think that if you were truly unhappy, you'd always be in a constant state of awareness and always be striving to achieve your goals, but that's where the habits come in. 

- Not taking academics seriously
- Not sticking to your fitness goals
- Not growing your social circle
- Skipping lectures and classes
- Procrastinating on important tasks 

All these things are important, and to a certain extend, are necessary. Their necessity is why you find yourself under stress and anxiousness when you have those 'rushing' fits to get them done. When you've got plenty of leeway and time to complete them, you procrastinate, yet when their respective deadline is right around the corner, you rush and panic to see them through, no longer worrying about the quality in which their completed, and only focused on their completion. 

&amp;nbsp;

**STEP 1: RESPONSIBILITY**
The first thing you need to do in order to change yourself, is take responsibility for your previous failures. Don't beat yourself up over what you've failed at in the past, but take responsibility for it. You didn't fail 9 classes because it was too hard, or because the subject matter was too complex for you. You failed those 9 classes because you didn't take studying and preparation seriously. Similarly with your excuse of trying to self teach yourself in courses that you've missed constant days in. You aren't really trying to self teach yourself and catch up, you're trying to avoid those disappointed stares and glares from your professors. You aren't taking your responsibilities seriously and are actively trying to avoid the consequences of your actions through self-reassurance. It's the same thing with your physical health and social life. Though the circumstances may differ for those other two aspects of your life, the result is obviously the same, as you're here looking for help. 

&amp;nbsp;

You need to embrace your consequences head on. The hardest consequence to face in your circumstance is going to be academics. You aren't doing too well, and you're going to need to accept the fact that this is a consequence of your own doing. In embracing and facing your consequences, you can also do it in a productive manner. Go to your current professors and explain to them your personal struggles, don't use them as excuses, but explain to them that you're struggling. Explain to them that you understand the effects of your previous actions and the consequences they have on your grades and performance in class. Apologize to your professors and yourself for not taking them so seriously, and ask them what you can do to improve from this point forward. In regards to your professors, understand that there may be a chance that you're too far gone in a particular class to bring yourself above a passing grade. Let this sink in, but don't let it destroy you. It's be another failure, but it's be something you can actively learn from and use to better yourself in the future. In regards to yourself, no matter how good or bad the outcome of confronting your professors may be, forgive yourself. **Forgive Yourself**, and allow yourself to start moving towards a more productive lifestyle. 

&amp;nbsp;

**STEP 2: MINDSET**
Your mindset will be the single most important thing that helps you maintain your new productive lifestyle. Develop a positive and self loving mindset, and you'll be able to achieve anything, regardless of your current circumstances. Now, the hardest thing to do in regards to mindset and teach people how to improve their current mindset in order to have a more positive and productive one. In this regard, I can only suggest and recommend to you the way I've managed to change my mindset to one of self loathing, excuses and doubt, into one of self forgiveness, loving and positivity. YouTube. Pull up YouTube and type in mindset motivation. Listen to as many videos as you can as often as you can. While you're in the shower, while you're driving, while your walking/exercising, etc. There are many aspects of my life I've tried to change in the past, and I can't say enough how important it was for me to have the proper mindset to see those things through. Before I understood the importance, I'd constantly fail and revert back to my previous lifestyle, never understanding why I couldn't see anything through, why I always failed. After learning about the importance and power of mindset, I welcome adversity and challenge in my life. I no longer allow myself to wallow in self pity and doubt, and I'm motivated and driven to see my goals through. 

&amp;nbsp;

**STEP 3: PERSEVERANCE**
Finally, you're going to need perseverance. Understand something here. You're wanting to change a whole lot about yourself. That's great, and it's something that you're capable of, but do not forget this key fact. **You're currently conditioned to self-doubt, procrastinate, give up, and make excuses. That is your current lifestyle.** Fight and argue with me as you may, this is the simple truth as of right now. These things are habits for you, and are why you continuously go back to them when things don't go so well for you. They're comforting to you, and they're your body's way of dealing with misfortune and failure. When changing any habit, it's going to be hard. You're going to have days when you don't feel like doing what you know you should be doing. Not because you don't want to better yourself, but because your body and mind is used to doing those previous bad habits, and not used to or comfortable with the new habits you're trying to implement. You've got persevere through the resistance your body and mind will **inevitably** give you in an attempt to revert you back to your old ways. It will be hard, and anyone that tells you otherwise is lying. You fill face incredible urges that sometimes will seem unbearable. Fight through them, and you'll eventually reach a point where the new habits you're trying to form will become the norm for you. If you don't persevere, you'll continue to fail and be unhappy for the remainder of your life. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I wish you the best. :)

[NeedAdvice] I'm really close to losing my degree. Why do I self-sabotage myself like this??;t3_83o6i7;7;"This post is hard for me to make, this the first time I’ve ever unloaded 100% like this. 

I've been on this downward spiral for three years now. I'm in my 3rd year of electrical engineering and things are BAD all around. Socially, academically, and health wise. As of this year I have failed 9 courses, my GPA is 1.7, I’m very overweight, and I can't seem hold on to a friend. If I keep going down this path I may be forced to withdraw next year. 

I don’t know what it is with me but I don’t ever step up to the goals I set for myself. Even trivial things take a lot of effort. It’s like I don’t even care. Every time I have a huge assessment, I start doubting myself and I get consumed by this fear of failure. Just thinking about it would make me feel so anxious I end up procrastinating to avoid the feeling. The result? I either panic and study last minute or even worse I succumb to this weird “all or nothing” mentality and I don’t bother showing up. Coming to lectures sucks too, when I do come I can’t keep up with what’s being taught so I end skipping and try self-study to catch up. If skip for too long I get too ashamed to come back because by profs give me disapproving looks (I’m one the only black people among my classes so I stick out like a sore thumb).

When my academics slip, everything I’ve built up with it slips away too like a domino effect. I can’t focus on extracurricular activities I involve myself in because I’m too worried about my grades (Makes for a pretty bad resume). My weight loss regime gets tossed out the window, my social life takes a dip along with my confidence, and all my hobbies are shelved. It’s a sequence that repeats itself time and time again! I’VE HAD ENOUGH. I want to change, I want to make progress, I want to be happy, I want balance. So why am I like this?? Why can’t I stay motivated? When I write it out like this it seems so obvious what needs to change. So why can’t I believe in myself? 

What really baffles me is that I was almost the opposite of this in high school. I had a very active social life, played sports, I had confidence, and I even had the highest average of my grade (I needed to an 90+ average to even get into this program). I know the change from high school to University is big, but this really feels like something else. It’s like I’ve fallen, and I can’t get back up. I’m sorry for rambling so much but I have to know. What can I do to be a better me? Can I even bounce back enough to get job in this field when I graduate?
";51;"I mean this in the kindest possible way, when you say you were the complete opposite in high school, did that success and confidence come easily to you? 

I was you, and god forbid, your future self. 
Everything came very easily to me up until high school. Academics, friends, I had a good body without trying. I have always been told I’m smart and I have an awesome future and I ran with it.

It all went downhill after high school because I had never learnt to WORK HARD. Everything just fell in my lap (probably a little studying for academics) and in university, I had to actually put in effort to do stuff and I had never learnt how. I blamed everything and everyone for my shitty life except myself. I learnt my $20k worth life lesson after I got kicked out. 

If you are anything like me, unfortunately you have to start from scratch my friend. The first thing to build is not smartness, not confidence, not your body by hitting the gym for 6 days a week but in fact, discipline. Once you build that, everything else will fall into place this time. I really wish you all the very best.

";51;fwiw I actually did end up withdrawing, actually I dropped out three times in a row, and it was the best thing I could do for myself at the time. The high stress of college and my general unpreparedness came together and beat my shit down, culminating in a vicious spiraling out of control. A lack of caring about your tasks and low effort/social exhaustion are common symptoms of depression, and I would consider pursuing a therapist, possibly through your University's mental health resources (UMN has theirs through the disability resource center, not sure if your uni would sort it in there or somewhere else). Even if you don't think this is a real depression or that this is all just a self-taught laziness taking over, starting the therapy process is huge. Therapy is easy to practice by yourself as well, but the visits you make first will help teach you how to handle yourself. They can help you to identify your stressors and create mental preparations to compensate for your feelings of doubt and worry trying to sabotage what you really want in your life. Also if you need to talk to your Uni about getting classes and grades retroactively dropped then that paperwork from visiting a therapist will be gold in terms of validating your stress level. I'm by no means a professional but if you wanna talk about it your can pm me whenever. Debilitating stress is legitimate, and its nothing to be ashamed about. ;5;0.09803921568627452;[[0.98372824]];[[0.65469745]];0.9156;0.15;0.721;0.129;-0.9461;0.096;0.7490000000000001;0.155;0.07999999999999999;-0.033535353535353515;0.02671717171717173;-0.06025252525252525

";51;"&gt; If skip for too long I get too ashamed to come back because by profs give me disapproving looks 

Hey, this happened to me too.  It was nothing to do with the colour of your skin dude.  The fact is that quite often, lecturers have huge egos and they think their subject is millions times more important than the others.  They also think that their every word should be listened to even if they're very boring and don't teach the subject well.  

I remember this waste of space tutor at college when he was teaching Project Management.  When the class began to understand what was being asked of us, he would widen the scope of the assignments instead of letting us put in what we had.  He was a c--t.  Used to talk about his boring kids to the women in class.  The f--k has that got to do with me and the money I spent to be there?   So, he used to teach about 'scope creep' happening to projects and then he actually allowed the assignments to creep wider in scope.  It was such time wasting bullshit.  

So what I'm saying is, don't blame yourself too much and don't feel guilty about staying away from a classroom of braying baboons making fart noises and joking around while you're sweating your brains out and the lecturer is over complicating what is very simple to grasp material.  

Having said that, you need to condense all the study material as soon as you can.  You need to skim read the material a few times as soon as you can.  All of it.  Even just the headlines and subtitles, just to find out where you are.  

And you need to set up your room right.  One area/desk for admin, one area/table for study and creativity.   You need enough lights in your room, you need to move all the crap off the floor and put it out or in cupboards.  As Jordan Peterson says: CLEAN YOUR ROOM.  Start there, it's as good enough a thing to start on as anything.  

This shit isn't easy, but if you can just pass the stupid modules, then you've still got something as opposed to nothing.

Even if you end up making the ‘wrong’ choice, make that decision a conscious one. Eventually it gets easier to choose the other way. Idk if that helps, but I hope it does. Motivation isn’t dependable, waiting for it won’t get you anywhere! Each time you have to choose to do the less enjoyable thing.

A NEW QUESTION: I know that maybe it's a little late to post new questions here but I'll try anyway. How do you organize and use the little free time you have to relax?";58;"Jordan Peterson put life into perspective for me. 

The basic system is that life is *hard* when you do nothing, more in an abstract and impending doom sense, life is also *hard* when you are productive, when you do things, but that`s the point, as life has always been through the ages, however, one grants you things the other does not. You have pain when you do nothing but you can have pain and get something. 

You don`t have to agree with Jordan Peterson`s philosophy but some of his content is sound enough to follow.

My recommendations:  
  
Reduce your workload.  
Do fun, satisfying, low stress activities (which DO NOT evolve around gaming)  
Make your to eat properly and healthy.  
Get out in the sun or take vitamin D if there is no sun. (talk with a doc about that one)  
Get yourself evolved in EASY physical activity:
e. g. easy running, yoga, relaxed swimming.   
  
After a 2-4 Weeks you should be fine.

Also, exercise. Do a sport you like, and go to the gym. This helps a lot and to see your body developing is (for me at least) stimulating.

I don't think this is it. I think this is the bigger issue:

&gt;But now that the exam session is gone (pretty well for my standards), I’m losing all the strenght and grit I had to stick to my studying routine.

You need to come up with proactive reasons to do what you're doing, or else your brain will consider everything equal and do whatever is the most fun for it at the time.

What I always recommend to people who have trouble with structured exercise but love video games is to find a fun sport to play that doesn't require a whole lot of structure. If you can go shoot hoops at the local community center, or swim, or run around the neighborhood catching pokemon, or whatever, and then associate that activity with the same impulses as gaming, you'll find yourself running out basically at random to go do those active things for fun.

As for studying, there's no real need to keep an exhaustive studying routine going 24/7. You're not preparing for an imminent exam anymore, so there's no need to study for 100 minutes. Just doing 5-10 practice problems a day is enough to keep the material fresh and strong in your mind in preparation for the exam.";2;0.034482758620689655;[[0.9461744]];[[0.65251998]];0.8534;0.145;0.741;0.114;0.9658;0.149;0.769;0.08199999999999999;-0.036000000000000004;0.007283057851239673;0.13249999999999998;-0.1252169421487603

A NEW QUESTION: I know that maybe it's a little late to post new questions here but I'll try anyway. How do you organize and use the little free time you have to relax?";58;"There are two options. First is start so small that you can’t possible fail. Then work your way up. Do 1 push-up a day, but don’t you dare skip a day. Soon you’ll be like “okay, I’m here, I’ll do 2”

The other option is SCARE THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF YOURSELF. Are you insane!?!? Why are you wasting your time??? Life is so short! You don’t have that many years of energy left! You’re getting older! Do you WANT to do something with your life? Do you want to succeed? Do you know that whatever it is you want to do as a career, there is currently someone out there RIGHT NOW who is working their fucking ass off while you’re whining on reddit!?!?! What do you think will happen when you two end up interviewing for the same job!? How are you going to provide for yourself??? Do you realize how hard it is to make it in the real world? Do you know how expensive big cities are!?! When I was living in Alabama I had a nice 2 bedroom apartment for $700 a month. When I first moved to LA I had a not so nice one bedroom for $1500!!!!! And that’s cheap! San Francisco is worse!! New York!?!? Fah get aboutit! 

You are wasting the only life you are ever gonna get on a fucking website where all that matters is getting a dopamine hit every time you post something and then people reply and you get to see that little orange box. Are you posting to get actual advice!?! If I told you that the best thing you can do is quit Reddit, would you do it!?!? NO! Because you’re addicted! You’re addicted to scrolling through and finding an interesting post and then getting a little dopamine reward. You think you’re any different than an old fuck at a casino pulling a slot machine!? NO! Only it’s worse because you’re young and full of energy and have your whole life ahead of you but instead of actually CREATING something and adding value to the world, you’re sitting on your computer and phone most of the day, waiting for that little drug hit. You’re just CONSUMING AND CONSUMING while the people who made this website and made the content that you are being led to are making money off of YOUR ATTENTION. 

They get money by highjacking your attention, getting your eyes to stare at the screen so they can flash their brand name in front of it and trick you into buying their thing. Think it doesn’t work? THINK AGAIN! It fucking does. That’s why advertisers keep paying for it. That’s how TV is made. Television isn’t made to entertain you. It’s made to make you stare at a screen so they can then flash their brand in front of your eyes so you’ll buy their thing. (Network TV, not cable.)

So what are you gonna do, huh? You gonna keep SEARCHING AND SEARCHING for the secret answer to all your problems on a fucking website? Or are you going to grow up and admit that you KNOW what you need to do, but you’re just to lazy and scared to do it. 

You know the difference between you and Elon Musk? He tried. That’s it. He thought of something he wanted to do and then he tried. And he failed and he failed and he failed and THEN he succeeded. 

Whereas you probably haven’t even taken the REAL TIME to sit by yourself in a room or on top of a mountain for 10 hours and REALLY THINK about what you want to do with your life. You’d rather just look at funny gifs and porn. 

So don’t you dare complain that you’re having trouble succeeding. You haven’t even TRIED. Try like a mother fucker and fail for 5 years straight and THEN come looking for help. 

But don’t do it here. Go to someone who has succeeded and what you want to do and ask them. It’s called mentor ship, HEARD OF IT!?!? 

So delete your fucking Reddit account and go sit in a room for 10 hours without your phone or computer and just think. Just think. And then do. And then fail. And then analyze why you failed. And then make a better plan and try again. And then fail. Analyze, try again, fail. IF YOU KEEL DOING THIS YOU WILL GET EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED OUT OF LIFE. 

Now I have to get off the toilet and go back to work doing the thing I’ve been dreaming of doing my whole life, why? Because I failed at it until I got it. My legs are numb.

I'm in a haze, I don't know which way is up. I don't know what to do.";178;"For people who experience depression, it is common. It's sort of the elephant in the room when talking about depression tbh. Your mind feels stuck, trapped, caught in a cycle of self-loathing. So looking to find a way away from that pain, it will latch onto that. It has more to do with a faulty coping mechanism than laziness. Although, an increase in discipline will more allow you to not indulge in harmful self-talk.

One of the things that therapy teaches, is that you don't have to accept those thoughts. CBT says that you don't have to accept any specific thought at face value. Often, the conclusion of something is faulty or drawn incorrectly. Mindfulness says that thoughts are thoughts and you don't have to engage them at all. 

I also experience depression and manage it daily. Sometime I have a rough day, or week. Eventually, I have some good days though and remember why I want to be here. Countering the depressive thoughts that you have a predisposition for requires discipline. Depressives have a default mindset that feeds harmful thoughts. 

Keep going to therapy. I know it's hard. I know that a lot of this comes across as bull-shit. It takes a long time for you to change thought patterns and look at life in a different perspective.

FWIW, after essentially killing off that lifestyle - methodically replacing everything that sucked about it with things that sucked less - I find myself much better able to shrug off minor failures. It took a year or two to get to this point and stop reacting with such panic to minor things, but it worked eventually. 

So, my 2c is to heed the ""this lifestyle is intolerable"" cues of suicidal ideation by improving rather than destroying your life. If you're scared to discuss self destructive thoughts with your therapist due to fear of being involuntary hospitalized, it's worthwhile to read the letter of the mandatory reporter laws in your state to understand exactly what they can and can't legally keep confidential.

Look, I think your problem isn't that you're not disciplined. Your therapist seems like they're headed in the right direction with you, but they're not quite on the right road to get there. If *you* personally see your problems as rooted in discipline, and you beat yourself up for being lazy and listless, which is easy to get hung up on, you're going to project that in your therapy sessions. Your therapist is going to riff on that. And so here you are.

What are your goals? That's the problem I'm seeing here when I read your post. When you say that you think ""life is always going to be like this,"" is that a realistic assessment? You say you're unmotivated at school, and that you're graduating soon. Do you want to use your degree to find a job? Do you want to go back for more school after your BA? Do you want to leave psych altogether and work as a white water rafting instructor? I think /u/MyOther_UN_is_Clever is hitting the nail on the head. You can't know the future. But what you can figure out is what would make that future better. What would make you happy? Money? Hot dates? A house full of puppies? Anything? Depression makes that question hard as hell because sometimes *everything* feels boring and dumb and useless. But surely something would make you happy, or did at one time in your life.

That's what you need to figure out. Don't worry about motivation or discipline yet. Find something worth getting disciplined *for*. If you don't know what you want your life to be like, you can't work towards it. If you try to tackle your problems as one big blob, you will feel overwhelmed and give up. Break them up. You want to take care of your dog? See if you have time to get a side gig and make some money to get him looked at. Want to be more motivated at school? Think about why you're there in the first place. Is it to get a job after school? Start looking at jobs that seem interesting. Look for an internship. If you don't like anything at all, start trying things in your free time to see if you do like them. The point is, life is infinitely surprising. You never know who you will meet, or when, but you have to understand that there is a future out there where you are safe, relatively content, and not feeling like you're treading water.

All this with a grain of salt obviously. I know it's easier said than done. Hope you find some peace soon. PM if you ever need anything.

In my humble opinion, I’ve learned (after having dealt with depression and similar thoughts) that we are not really our mind. We decide on which thoughts we act upon unconsciously which can create a world of suffering for ourselves. I think if you can detach from the illusion that we aren’t this ego-based self, and get back in touch with our higher selves, the infinite, unconditional love that is connected to all things, you will have a new perspective on life. Chances are you’re living a life untrue to who, deep-down, you desire to be. Realign yourself with your higher self and I’m sure your problems will fade.

You are just aware of your subconscious mind.

Even the slightest aversion contains thoughts of suicide.

For example, you are having a great day and then someone walks by and you can hear the music in their headphones and for a split second you don’t like it.

In that split second, the inner child in you is saying: “Why can’t life be exactly as I want it? I wish I were dead! I wish this experience were not happening!”

What do you think not wanting or liking an experience is? It is wishing to be dead.

While this is NOT specialized advice, from my experience this translates to very strict parents. It is also of a cliche for this to be true in Asian countries, where parents have unreasonable and unhealthy standards for their children.

So I may suggest that you talk about your relationship with your parents with your therapist? Like it or not, 99% of the reasons we're fucked up later in life has to do with something our parents did or did not.

If they gave us too little liberty, we develop a relationship of unhealthy, even toxic codependence. If they've gave us too much freedom, we don't learn how to be accountable for our own actions. If they've been there too much, we take people for granted. If they haven't been there, we develop separation anxiety from people.

It's good that you're seeing a professional about this. I am 99% sure this is not your fault and it is a developed behavior from childhood but if you talk with your therapist about this, you'll get to the end of it. If you can't, find another therapist. I've done this and it helped me immensely, even if I don't feel very keen of talking about it.

Juggling being a student leader for 3 clubs (successfully), getting high honors, doing sports on the side, and (of course) dealing with all the emotional and social drama that HIGH SCHOOL friends and family bring. 

I was succeeding. I was giving up some sleep and some fun to do this, but I didn't mind that much. 

I've been in college for a couple years now, and I've been SLIPPING on EVERYTHING. My GPA has tanked, I stay out of touch with my social circle, often deliberately, and I basically stay indoors most days doing nothing much. 

I don't know what I lost or why. I don't know what happened. Maybe it's because in high school I had an inner drive that said ""the only way to get out of this pain is to go through it."" 

Now that I did go through it. I've let my standards slip. And I've consistently let it go there.

Yes.

&gt; punish yourself for every task you fail.

No.  No.  No.

&gt; my mom doesn't seem to understand how I feel so she just yells at me for ""making excuses.""

Your mom is under a lot of stress.  She is fearful-angry FOR you, NOT (at) you.  OK?  Learn the difference.  She is afraid for your sake, because (throws arm about your shoulder), it will be tougher as you get older unless you can turn the tide against you.

(tightens arm)  Shh...  Breathe deep, long, slow until you are calm.  Imagine I'm a Kung Fu master telling you to start at the basics, always at the basics.  Breathe.  Breathe until you are calm.

There is way too much hype over giant leaps and too little appreciation for the small steps.  FYI, no giant leap happened without a lot of small steps, OK?  Breathe.  Breathing is the simplest step and the most crucial step.

At least the movies got this right - them martial arts masters are basic steps and breathing exercise fans BECAUSE:

*  Small steps is the KEY to making ""action"" ""do something"" neural wiring in our brains.

*  Breathing, mere breathing, has direct effect on our mental state.  Calm people breath differently from fearful, angry, excited folks.

Kung Fu masters have to start with becoming masters of controlling their breathing pattern-first.  Cause when you're calm, you master fear and anger and excitement.  Without those three stooges, big problems are small problems.  Small problems are no problems.  Reverse when they're around.

*  Be **Aware** when you're getting upset.
*  **Breath** deep long slow until you are:
*  **Calm**

ABC - Aware, Breath, Calm.  Just keep doing this consistently and it will become AUTOMATIC.

Now, to help ABC - just as with your mom - you gotta - always as much as possible ALWAYS - try to keep in mind that everyone too has a lot of problems to deal with.

You're probably thinking right now that you have more problems than other people.  That is correct.  And the inverse is also true.  A lot of people have way more problems than you have.  And... animals have it even way worse off...

&gt;  I have no friends, 

Because people tend to gravitate away from those who can't handle their problems.  Please be patient about this.  Because it's human nature.  We each of us have so many problems that we just prefer those who can handle more shit than we can.

But what about me?  Why am I trying to help a stranger on the internet?  Sometime ago, I realized that the more I try to help people (even strangers on the internet), the better I just get at it.  WHICH in turns makes me better at helping those in my real general area.

The more I lower other people's stress, the better they can handle their problems.  Which means fewer problems in my general area, which means less stress for me.

It's slow-going, but every little bit helps.  Always keep this in mind.  Every little task done helps!  We start small, and we keep doing them and in doing so - makes more ""we can do shit"" neural wiring so we can do more and more and more.

The more problems we solve, the better we get at it.  And then, there will be a time when we can actually solve more problems than the number of problems reality throws at us at a regular basis, and boy - does it feel good.

I want you - everyone - to get to that point.  (So, we can get more volunteers at animal shelters.)";45;1.0714285714285714;[[0.95883743]];[[0.51689259]];0.8406;0.111;0.792;0.09699999999999999;-0.9676;0.091;0.782;0.127;0.05;0.05554112554112554;0.08809703098106712;-0.03255590543994158

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.";42;"There’s a lot going on here (including the fact that you’re at an age when your body and hormones are doing crazy things anyway), but most of what you said sounds like me when I was depressed. I was depressed for a long time, until I went to grad school and couldn’t function well enough to hack it until I’d addressed the depression. 

Because what you describe sounds so familiar to me, I’ll recommend the things that changed my life: 1) Sleep. You need to be sleeping at the same general time every night for 8-ish hours. Go to bed early. I used to hate this; now I look forward to it. And I can’t tell you how much more efficiently my brain works. It turns out being chronically sleep deprived is *really* awful for you. Who knew?? 2) Talk to a mental health professional—a counselor, therapist, whatever you want to call it—who is trained to recognize your specific symptoms and can help you accordingly. This isn’t some mysterious, untreatable quality you have because you’re more flawed than the average person; this is mental illness, and it can and should be treated, just as any other illness would be. Also, this is nothing to be ashamed of, so don’t bother with that nonsense. 3) Figure out your medication situation. I don’t know what you already take, but perhaps your dosages need to be adjusted. And if you don’t take an anti-depressant, I’d look into that and see if one might be helpful to you. They changed everything for me, and now I’m getting to see for the first time what it feels like to be a happy, fully functioning adult. It’s pretty great.

Take care of yourself. And know that you’re not the only one who feels like that. SO many of us know exactly what you’re going through. &lt;3";3;0.07142857142857144;[[0.97896089]];[[0.64886154]];0.8406;0.111;0.792;0.09699999999999999;0.8081;0.139;0.7440000000000001;0.11699999999999999;-0.008000000000000007;0.05554112554112554;0.0574074074074074;-0.001866281866281856

The only people I care about are: My mom, dad, grandmother, and brother. So you might say ""do it for them,"" but I can't. No one in my family shows appreciation or excitement for what I do.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have tried everything I could possibly think of, and my anxiety is acting up much more than usual. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.";42;"&gt;  I have tried everything I could possibly think of

This is your only problem. You are still within the prison of self-doubt. You don't believe it's possible for you to break out of your misery. When you say I tried everything I could possibly think of you are stating a falsehood. You can't know what are the things you can possibly think of, let alone try all of them.

My advice to you is to break free out of the illusion that your circumstances are unbeatable. Before you set small tasks, or think of a goal, or do anything you were advised to do on the sub, you need to **believe** that it is possible for you to achieve greatness no matter what are the obstacles laid in front of you in life.

How to break free out of your illusory prison? This is the hardest part. But I will give you a remedy to help you with the process. But before I share my trick with you I need to explain to you exactly why you feel very unmotivated at the moment. 

You fear pain and suffering. You fear discomfort. They are your Babadook. Your fears have cornered you. Because you didn't push back, they kept pressing on until you were unable to endure the simplest, yet the little painful, process of choosing what to have for dinner. Feeling overwhelmed by options so much it causes you anxiety is an indication that your ability to endure any discomfort or pain has been reduced to a dangerously low level. This is the core problem. You can never feel motivated by anything now, because motivation in your brain is now calculated as an incentive to go through unbearable pain. Your brain will resist any attempt or thought that closely resembles a motivation or a set goal. It is protecting you from your Babadook. Your brain is not your mentor, it's your accomplice. He will do what he thinks is best for you based on your beliefs.

The explanation is needed because otherwise my remedy will seem a bit nuts. My trick for you is to take a cold shower. Yeah, sounds crazy and pointless. The trick is a break-through tool when used properly. You may need to do it a couple of times or just once, depends on how much you will reflect on it.

Why taking a cold shower will help you increase your pain/discomfort endurance to a level that will grant you a bit of mobility progress-wise? Because this is how it will go: 
You will go to the shower and turn on the water and see with your hand if it's cold enough to cause discomfort but not make you catch the flu. You will stop and question the sanity of doing this in the first place because some guy on Reddit told you it will help. You will then imagine how discomforting it would be to pour that cold water on your skin, and it will feel like a freaking nightmare. Your brain will use all his power to deter you from going ahead with the plan. But here is the beauty of it, your brain can't reason you out of it because there is no real reason backing up your decision in the first place. You are doing because you simply wanna try if this would help or not. No goals, no motivation, nothing too tangible your rationalizing skill can tackle and defeat. You are doing it simply because you decided to. And if you beat your brain and actually do it, something magical will happen. The nightmarish picture your brain has drawn for you on how this will go will collapse. ""This is not as bad as I expected,"" you might say. Because it is not. Your brain magnifies fears to deter you from doing what he thinks is harmful to you.

Now once you are done taking the cold shower and cursing me for making such a suggestion, I want you to sit and reflect on the experience. This is very important. Think about how scary it was to take a cold shower in your mind before doing it, and how it actually turned out to be. Think about the breakthrough moment, between the you saying ""Fuck this shit I'm not doing it. This is stupid."" and the other you saying ""Fuck you. I'm doing it anyway."" What happened there? Simply put, that was a taste of the triumph of the will over the illusions of exaggerated fears.

Your brain is like an overprotective mother. She acts and talks based on her fears for you. ""Don't eat too much candy or you will get a painful injection."" She knows it's a false correlation but she knows it works. And her intentions are pure. You need to tell her: ""Don't worry, Mom/Brain, I know what I'm doing. I can handle this.""

Feel free to pm if you want. I'll be glad to help. 

As I read your post, I can already feel a person who wants to break out of his self-made jail, the worst, most secure, most cruel kinds of jails. And you will, my friend. You will.

Currently your mom does everything for you. 

And your diagnosis traps you into believing you can't do much. 

So before anything else you have to find a why. In this case, your why is a goal, and your center. It is like gravity, something that pulls you heard it. 

It could be that you are depressed. Or hormonal changes and changes with your medication. Or just life, and it feeling hopeless. It's okay. Accept that this is where you are now. You seem to feel like you have nothing. But you have family, a mom that while stressed takes care of you. And all she wants is that you have some initiative because she is worried for you. She wants you to have a good life, and for that you have to get ready to go for it, it won't all just be given you. Right now is the comfortable part of life. If you keep doing nothing life will get much harder. 

First. Fix your sleep schedule. Stop staying up late. Stop playing games or watching YouTube 1 hour before bed. Go to bed earlier than normal. 

Once you can improve your sleep schedule we can go to step 2. ";1;0.023809523809523808;[[0.9818322]];[[0.69349176]];0.8406;0.111;0.792;0.09699999999999999;0.8909999999999999;0.129;0.795;0.075;-0.040000000000000015;0.05554112554112554;0.1403361344537815;-0.08479500891265597

I agree with the folks who say that you need some sort of outside help.  Ideally, you would find someone who has some experience dealing with people who have a similar mental health history to you.

You mention high school - what is the counseling situation there? One of the facts you should be aware of is that it is much easier to get free outside help if you are under age 18. If you have an assigned counselor and you don't get along with them for some reason - go see another one and request to talk to them. This happens all the time, they don't take it personally.  Or ask a school administrator to be assigned to another counselor ""because you feel you could work better with them"". You don't have to get specific.

I just think that finding someone who knows your HS environment, and can work with you in detail to improve your motivation and discipline because they're already familiar with that environment, would be the quickest way for you to get help.

Do it for your family so that you can bring some happiness to their lives and so they don’t have to struggle in life. You should never do anything just for a “thank you”. That’s shallow. 

Every negative thing you’re thinking is just that— in your head. Your mind is a powerful thing. Trick yourself into believing you want to do something and that it’ll improve your life and bring happiness. You ever heard the phrase “fake it ‘til you make it?”. I’ve been in a similar state when I was younger: no motivation, no cares, no worries, no passion, no confidence, no positivity. Straight depression and no will or drive to do anything. Want to know what changed? You’re going to think I’m a liar. I had a realization, then I made a decision. I realized I enjoyed being miserable. I enjoyed being negative and not doing jack shit about jack shit. I decided to change that. I started to change my mindset and my outlook. Not because I was motivated to do so. Not at first anyway. I just thought about what a shitty person I was becoming and that I would one day be 45 and have provided no value to the world; a burden to everyone in my life. I didn’t want that. I faked positivity and optimism. I tricked myself into believing I wanted to go out, I wanted to learn, I was passionate about different things... I even told myself I was smart and adventurous and I was a social butterfly. Then what happened? Slowly, very slowly, I started to actually care and be motivated by things. Little by little, I found I was actually passionate about things I had started because I tricked myself into believing I enjoyed it. My mindset changed everything about me and how I lived my life. 

And today, I’m passionate about life. I’m motivated and have found a degree of success and wealth. I love learning new skills and meeting people and working. I love doing things for my family and seeing them happy. I’m finally happy. And it all started with a mentality change. It’s hard for sure. And you won’t want to do it. You’ll think it’s dumb. But that positive mental attitude goes a long way. 

You’re young, and most young people don’t know shit about life. Sorry but it’s true. Just do your best to find things you’re passionate about, learn to change your mindset to one of positivity, adapt to change, be kind, and never expect rewards of gratitude or shallow words of thanks. Knowing you helped contribute to someones momentary happiness is a reward in itself. At least that’s my opinion. 

Don’t give up bud. This world is cruel but it’s also beautiful. There is a lot to experience and a lot of growing you’ll need to do. Acknowledgement is the first step. Execution of your plan to improve is next. 

And stop letting people tell you that your mental illness limits you. That’s a poor excuse, honestly. It’s an obstacle for sure, and I don’t mean to speak lightly of mental illness— it’s a serious issue. But it doesn’t define you. The person who can help you the most is you.

I have read tons of posts on here, usually saying things like ""set small tasks for yourself,"" and ""punish yourself for every task you fail."" The problem is, I don't even have the discipline to discipline myself.

You should be motivated to do things for you because you deserve to meet the goals you set for yourself. If you aren't, perhaps you don't value yourself enough to think you should be able to do these things. I also have a lot of issues with this. Please PM me if you're up to it; you really remind me of you at that age and while all the stuff here is great advice, I know how much HARDER and how *impossible* it can be to help yourself when those you love are so afraid for you that they hold you back. You should write your mom a letter, honestly, to let her know how you feel in a rational and calm way. Outline things she can do to help you feel more able. And for goodness sake GO TO BED. Just for a few days try it and see how great you feel after. I always stayed up for the same reasons (watched a lot of adultswim as a kid as a result) and it seriously fucked up my grades, my social life, and my family life. I was always getting yelled at for oversleeping, falling asleep in class, I often didn't have homework done too. I mostly passed because of good test scores. Looking back, I didn't have anyone to tell me that just basic sleep was fucking up my life so much. It didn't get rid of the depression but man it makes wrangling that beast a lot easier.            
You don't deserve to punish yourself for the difficulties you're having. Forgive yourself for every small thing and one day the small things won't be so paralyzingly intimidating.

I might add that goals are goals, but habits let you reach those goals.

Read Duhigg's ""The power of habit"" to learn about habit loops.
For instance, the going to bed at 12 goal is actually a habit that you want to form.
Habits can be fostered by creating a ritual.
For instance, set a daily alarm that at 11:30 you turn off the TV and computer, brush your teeth, change into pajamas, and get into bed.
Do this ritual and your goal/habit will be reinforced. It is up to you to define a good reward for this habit.

Please Help , to overcome this fear .";3;Exposure is the only way to overcome fear. If you avoid it, you build the fear. Expose yourself and come out the other side knowing that you survived. You will build your confidence, not just mentally, in ideas, but in a deep way, at the level of your emotions, your stomach, your subconscious mind, etc. ;4;1.3333333333333335;[[0.93975777]];[[0.6148907]];-0.9948;0.071;0.698;0.231;-0.2023;0.07200000000000001;0.8079999999999999;0.12;-0.11200000000000004;-0.1761904761904762;-0.045;-0.1311904761904762

Please Help , to overcome this fear .";3;"Think about why you fell like that. Why is so important to not feel fear for you? It is because you don't want to be seen as weak? Because if that's the reason behind what pisses you off, maybe you should reevaluate why are you uncomfortable with that, not with your fears. Humans are made to feel fear, that's normal.

And if you want practically in overcoming those fears. Do shock therapy. Go there and allow yourself to feel the DEEPEST fear you can feel, without forcing it. Go slow and take your time.

Please Help , to overcome this fear .";3;"I personally dont kill bugs or animals because 1. It's gross. 2. Because its cruel and unneccessary. What really helped me to start appreciating and tolerating bugs and animals was realizing that they have complex thoughts and lives. I watched them and anaylzed their behavior. And what I saw changed my life. I saw that they make decisions, have mothers, have and care for their children, feel hungry, experience pain, can become anxious and sad just like us (Even though there is no proof I believe bugs can be sad and are more emotionally intelligent than we give them credit for.)  
Seeing them in this new light took away my fear at their foriegness and I realized that I could have easily been born a bug that is only murdered because is was born to be a particular species hated by humans. If your a butterfly youre safe, if you are a pincher bug or a spider that can build a complex web and do other amazing things then you are sentenced to death. If you're a pig you're food, a dog, you're a pet. I believe WE ARE ALL THE SAME TYPE OF BEING TAKING FORM IN DIFFERENT SHAPES. Empathy is what made me less afraid of them. It didnt go away immediately, but this small change in perception put me on the path. Bugs are still jumpy and crawly and unpredictable, but now I can catch them and realease them outside when I find them in my home. Even if it takes 15 minutes. There is really nothing that they do grosswise or scarywise that cannot be outdone 100 fold by humans. We are the scariest and most disgusting beings on this planet, and I challenge anyone to give me something a bug or animal does that can't be out""gross""ed by a human.";1;0.33333333333333337;[[0.95710258]];[[0.59237336]];-0.9948;0.071;0.698;0.231;-0.9124;0.063;0.833;0.10400000000000001;-0.11900000000000005;-0.1761904761904762;-0.05068655303030303;-0.12550392316017314

Please Help , to overcome this fear .";3;"I think you could start with your definition of the word coward. My definition has more to do with running away from physical confrontation-when you have an ethical or moral obligation to stand tall. Maybe you're not a coward. Maybe you're just a guy who doesn't like bugs. These fears you mention about bugs and mice seem pretty clearly something you have developed in your mind. You have attached some pretty negative emotions to the presence of these much smaller creatures. Have you ever tried to consider what you think will actually happen if you just stood there and looked at one of these bugs? Your intent is not to kill or hurt them, right? They are pretty unlikely to kill or hurt you, right? What would happen if you just watched them for a minute or two? When I started confronting my own limiting fears, I often found that my fear was actually based on my erroneous predictions of the future-what would really happen if I faced this particular fear, or that one? If you can get yourself to seriously walk through (in your mind) the few minutes following an encounter with one of these bugs or rodents, what do you really think might happen? Are you sure that your prediction is the only possible outcome? Can you possibly visualize some different outcomes following an encounter with a bug? For me, facing each and every limiting fear I had developed in my life, with this questioning attitude of ""What really could happen?"", and ""Is that really likely to happen"", made a huge difference. I actually started with the old one, ""What's the worse thing that COULD happen?"" and ""Can I live with that?"" These kinds of questions changed my life. Do you think you can try to get yourself to answer questions like that? 
Many fears (I believe most) are learned; and if they are learned, they can be un-learned. Often, we just need some new information, or a new perspective. Or even better, a prediction of a different future.";1;0.33333333333333337;[[0.95403776]];[[0.58677661]];-0.9948;0.071;0.698;0.231;-0.9502;0.081;0.7859999999999999;0.133;-0.10800000000000004;-0.1761904761904762;0.09697450697450698;-0.2731649831649832

I would agree with /u/trchttrhydrn about exposure. It's that way with every fear. From stage fright to fear of the dark. You have got to get comfortable being with it. Get yourself on Fear Factor and trapped in a box with bugs or something! This is definitely something you can overcome muchacho.

You’ll never be disappointed with anyone because you’ll never have to rely on them. 

The law of attraction states that what we focus our thoughts and feelings on, will create the reality we live in. If you’re struggling to make friends and feel like you’re un-likeable, then will experience just that. 

So how do you fix your current situation? 

Stop. Just stop doing all the painful and suffering in silence. 

Start. Begin to accept. You have survived every bad thing that has happened to you so far and you’re still alive,  that means you’re capable! You’re currently winning at life! 

Don’t dwell on the silly things. So what you don’t have a partner in a lab? Feel sorry for those that aren’t capable of doing it on their own and HAVE to do it with someone else. 

Think of how proud you’ll feel completing the experiment by yourself. All that hard work and reward will be because of you and your efforts, no one else’s. 

There is no shame in doing things alone. Take it as a blessing and you’ll realise that other people don’t matter. They never mattered. 

One soon, though, someone will stumble across you and never leave you. There are good people out there, for now the universe is giving you this experience now so you can learn to love yourself and be your own supporter. 

Also, I’ve never met an ungrateful person at a homeless shelter. You can always volunteer to serve food and you’d be surprised the friends you’ll make and what kinds of people they are.

* Slow down your drugs and alcohol comsumption. Its fuel for your depression. 

* Make plan for a whole day. You have stay at school for lunch or between classes? Make sure you have a plan. Study. Read. Learn. Draw. Gym. Sports. Watever. Don't stay alone wandering. Add new activity if you feel you have some energy for it! STOP WANDERING ALONE.

* Think and find your [IKIGAI](https://imgur.com/gallery/Zn59h). Notice that friends are not what is needed for a long and happy life. This is very important to consider. Focus on you.

If it feels like people are handing you forks when you’re asking for help to eat soup I wouldn’t be surprised. 

Recognising that you’re depressed as fuck is an admirable step and I think it’s totally reasonable to say ‘this sucks’. Yes, there is a lot to be grateful for but pretending everything is rosy isn’t healthy either. And homeless shelters are full of ungrateful people, sheesh. Anyone who has spent genuine time with people experiencing homelessness know this.

But it is true that you have a lot of great things going for you, not least your ability to reach out for help. That clearly shows you’ve got a way out of this mess and it’s not the exit door. You’ve got options and the ability to utilise then. Things will get better.

I went through a similar situation in high school and i just had to break those negative psychological habits like negative self talk and self sabotage. You can do it too! 

And now I’m happy with a long term boyfriend and a small circle of really close friends! 

OP don’t lose hope, I beg you please don’t throw away your whole life because of this dark rough patch.  Keep punching on, taking it one day at a time and try little by little to better yourself. Maybe it’s as simple as showering daily (which sounds silly but from my experience even the simplest of things is tough when you’re depressed) or maybe as challenging as seeing a councillor of psychologist. 
 
Pick one thing at a time and focus on you. Strive to help yourself see you in a more positive light. Don’t get me wrong I’m definitely not saying the whole “love yourself before anyone else can love you” cliche. That’s dumb because Loving yourself is damn hard and some of us can need a little help. But Just try doing things to help you like yourself a little more each week.

It will be a tough road I won’t sugar coat it. But you can do it. As someone who’s made it to the other side, just keep trying. Never give up!

The short answer is that it's gets better for nerds like us.
I'm in my early 30's and let me tell you, just take it all in and accept the situation. Do the things you love. Try your hardest to overcome porn addiction, because that shit will bring you down way faster the society ever will. (The struggle is real though, everyone has to deal with it)

You will find them when the time is right. 

That aside, please don't kill yourself :). I don't know you but losing you is a loss. I can understand how your situation and why you're feeling the way you do. Life does get better, trust me. 

If you want to change things, start with yourself. I don't know everything or even that much, but I know that change always has to start with you. It's the only thing you can have complete control over. As this subreddit recommends, take care of your physical body (exercise it, get enough sleep, take care of yourself), manage your substances (careful with the drugs and alcohol), and control your thoughts, especially your self talk. 

Control the way you treat yourself. I know this shit is difficult and it can really drain you, but beating yourself up is not going to help. When you're faced with something difficult, tell yourself that you can make it. ""I can make it through the next minute."" You CAN!! And if you can make it through that minute, you can make it through the next. Practice it. Repeat it, learn to love it. One minute at a time, you can turn your life around. 

What I like to do, every day, is promise to do my best. I make this commitment to myself. In times of indecision or struggle, I tell myself, ""YOU PROMISED YOUR BEST."" Give that gift to yourself, too. Do your best.

One strategy that really, REALLY helped: every meal before you eat, think about how the food is going to make you feel after you've eaten it.

I used to eat KD almost daily. Always tasted great but felt terrible afterwards. Once I had started to think about how it would make me feel, it was easier to avoid.

";1;"I totally understand where you're coming from.

Here's a question for you: what are the 10 most meaningful things in your life? What makes you excited when you think about it? Who or what do you care about more than anything? How do you *feel* when you think about your goals?

There are thousands of goals that you could work towards that are lifelong endeavors. It's intimidating. You could climb the corporate ladder. You could use your job to fund your hobbies. You could make your hobbies your job. You can take care of animals in need. You could focus on having a loving, caring family. You could become a fitness model on instagram. The options are limitless. These options take form in single word statements that you can focus on. Fame. Financial Independence. Adventurous. Kind. Supportive. Family oriented.

What do those terms make you feel? Why do you care about them? You want to explore how you feel about as many of these things as possible. Once you find what you care about, it will be infinitely easy to be motivated to do those things.

I highly recommend reading ""A Man's Search for Meaning"" By Viktor E. Frankl. He does a much better job of describing these concepts than I ever could. (Sidenote, ignore the ""man"" part of the book title, it was written in the 50s which were a different era).

You sound like you have a great baseline to build your meaning off of. Good luck!";3;3.0;[[0.95985522]];[[0.51097289]];-0.9729;0.077;0.7929999999999999;0.131;0.9951;0.226;0.755;0.019;-0.261;-0.06270476190476193;0.3441774891774892;-0.4068822510822511

";1;Off days are hard! You wan't to give yourself time to enjoy and relax, but still want to get stuff done. It's quite the dilemma. One of the things that helped me start exercising was I told my mom to remind me every day, and I felt I had to because I set the expectation for her, someone who'd want me to succeed, so I couldn't let her down. Maybe tell a close friend be your accountability buddy and ask them to check in on you if you've worked on your projects. This usually doesn't have to be a strict 5 hours, nor is setting a 5 hour expectation beneficial to starting, because it may overwhelm you. Just set the expectation of doing something for your project. Break it down into bits of what you want to accomplish, and as you cross these todo's off you'll notice you'll want to check the next thing off. It's important to avoid chasing a dopamine high through means such as social media, because they make it increasingly more difficult to start something that doesn't give you immediate joy, but will give you a sense of accomplishment, which is a longer lasting sense of joy. I hope I could help, and I wouldn't mind being an accountability partner if you need it!;2;2.0;[[0.97309971]];[[0.5610264]];-0.9729;0.077;0.7929999999999999;0.131;0.9876;0.193;0.7559999999999999;0.051;-0.196;-0.06270476190476193;0.10986111111111113;-0.17256587301587306

";1;"Have you been juggling trying to establish other habits as well whilst you establish your morning routine?

What's your ideal morning routine consist of? Perhaps you're trying to do too much

What's your diet look like? It's odd to see you're getting a fair amount of sleep and wake up actually feeling tired.

Also could be you may be lacking in vitamins, perhaps vitamin D if you don't get much sunlight that's throwing you off balance. 

5 hours a day intensely is INTENSE. Know that it may take a year or even more to honestly build up to that, and I'm not even sure if you're counting other hours used that day to work on other things.

Take it slow, you've done awesome to establish the base you have now it just comes down to making even further progress

Figure out where you want to go (which seems like you have a good grasp on) and keep heading in that direction.

When you come across the problems, you need to diagnose them and find the correct solution.

So as you have, you've been trying hard to get a morning routine going but consistently fail - why?

Is it because the morning routine is too tedious?

Or is it because you feel insanely tired in the morning?

If the latter, why do you feel so tired?

You need to not tolerate these problems and instead fix them and move past them and just keep doing this until you get to where you want to be.

[NeedAdvice] Can’t do this anymore. Burnt myself out as a kid with responsibility, now I have zero discipline to the point l lie to my boyfriend JUST to procrastinate.;t3_7zvb4o;4;"Alright, back story, I was homeless from age 12-15 with my mother. We’d ride our bikes 20+miles a day to my mom’s odd jobs where I’d also work to scrape up whatever money we could. At age 15, I had to survive on my own because my mom didn’t have the means nor discipline herself. I couched surfed and sometimes even slept in cars people left open in parking lots all while holding two jobs working over 16+hour days until I was age 18 where I landed a job from ATT to car sales. This is where the declination of discipline began. Although I worked 12 hours daily Monday-Saturday selling cars, the days were mainly spent lounging around with coworkers with playing ping pong until guests arrived or answered our calls and emails. Eventually I quit to pursue school. I found a full time job that paid $2k monthly, perfect for me. Unfortunately, this job was wild. Everyone drank and smoked during work, and although I was pursuing schooling my discipline got even worse. I left after a couple months, not wanting to marinate in that lifestyle too long.

But it was too late. 

Now I’m 20. Because I abruptly left that lifestyle, I didn’t have many choices for work, especially for a sales job that didn’t come with an excess of hours. Now don’t judge me- I swapped to camming. Virtual masturbation if you will. Now I’m making $100/hr and despite everyone telling me “it’s only temporary! You won’t make that forever!” It’s been practically half a year and it’s only went up. Now I’m averaging $105-225/hour.

NOW THE PROBLEM IS-

I am so undisciplined I literally only work/cam for 3-4 hours a WEEK. And I’m SUPPOSED (upon the agreement I made with myself and my boyfriend) to be camming 3-4 hours A DAY. But- I DONT KNOW! Now it’s like time moves 12x slower than it used to just from doing small stupid things like pet the cats, masturbate off cam for fun, take naps, or watch stupid videos on my phone.

The worst part is I’ve been lying to my boyfriend about it.

Today is the last straw- My bf’s already mad at me because I promised I’d be online while he was at the gym for 3 hours. AND EVEN THEN I WAS ONLY ON FOR 59 MINUTES AND MADE $180. So I lied and said I was camming for 1 and a half hours and I thought he’d be cool with just that and me saying I had to go pee or do this or that- but even then the one hour and a half discrepancy had him livid!! He was so angry saying I could have made twice the money I did... he’s never got that angry.

Little does he know I could have made THREE times the money I did.

I can’t keep hiding this and pretend I’m making less to make it seem like I’m working more.

IM JUST SO LAZY AND TIME HAS NO MEANING ANYMORE AND I HAVE ZERO REAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

Not only that. I’m failing two classes now. I have 252 unread texts from my family included. My mom literally texted asking if I was alive yesterday. I still haven’t replied. This lack of discipline is now affecting all areas of my being.

Help me.

HOW DO I GET MY DISCIPLINE BACK??

It was easy when I was a kid and it was literally life or death sleeping on the streets if I wasn’t disciplined, but with all this freedom, there’s no REAL consequence if I’m not disciplined...

Anyone experience something similar, and if so, how the fuck did you get your head out of your ass and into the game?

Thanks.

TL;DR: having so much responsibility as a kid burned me out as an adult and I’ve picked up bad habits so in result I’m lying to my boyfriend about working more than I am so really I have more free time to procrastinate.";5;"Yeah experienced something similar, got my own business up and running, quit my full-time job, fucked around a bit and didn't put much effort into business when it was my own schedule.

Things went downhill a little bit until I realized I need to step shit up

Also I realized it's pretty shitty after a while of just doing nothing and wasting time all the time.

That's when I had to dig a little deeper and find some meaning or purpose behind what I'm doing.

It sounds like you're lacking some too right now.

You don't really *need* the money for camming or even to study.

I mean if I asked you what you're actually studying for you probably couldn't give me a straight answer.

And perhaps the only reason you cam right now is so you can pay the rent and buy food and all that other shit. And you can make it quite easily by just camming 3- 4 hours a week - let me know if I'm totally off here

Perhaps if you had a financial goal that would make you want to cam more to earn more money that would help. I don't know what that might be or if that would even be smart because more money generally doesn't solve problems.

It really comes down to finding a meaning in your life and some purpose that speaks to you imo. Then you can start connecting what you do in life to that thing and that helps fuel your decisions.

Otherwise if you don't have much purpose or meaning, then you can just squander time because in essence it has no value...";1;0.2;[[0.95727048]];[[0.5379983]];-0.9918;0.066;0.813;0.121;0.0225;0.085;0.838;0.078;-0.062;-0.03782894736842103;0.11777393753200205;-0.1556028849004231
[NeedAdvice] Can’t do this anymore. Burnt myself out as a kid with responsibility, now I have zero discipline to the point l lie to my boyfriend JUST to procrastinate.;t3_7zvb4o;4;"Alright, back story, I was homeless from age 12-15 with my mother. We’d ride our bikes 20+miles a day to my mom’s odd jobs where I’d also work to scrape up whatever money we could. At age 15, I had to survive on my own because my mom didn’t have the means nor discipline herself. I couched surfed and sometimes even slept in cars people left open in parking lots all while holding two jobs working over 16+hour days until I was age 18 where I landed a job from ATT to car sales. This is where the declination of discipline began. Although I worked 12 hours daily Monday-Saturday selling cars, the days were mainly spent lounging around with coworkers with playing ping pong until guests arrived or answered our calls and emails. Eventually I quit to pursue school. I found a full time job that paid $2k monthly, perfect for me. Unfortunately, this job was wild. Everyone drank and smoked during work, and although I was pursuing schooling my discipline got even worse. I left after a couple months, not wanting to marinate in that lifestyle too long.

But it was too late. 

Now I’m 20. Because I abruptly left that lifestyle, I didn’t have many choices for work, especially for a sales job that didn’t come with an excess of hours. Now don’t judge me- I swapped to camming. Virtual masturbation if you will. Now I’m making $100/hr and despite everyone telling me “it’s only temporary! You won’t make that forever!” It’s been practically half a year and it’s only went up. Now I’m averaging $105-225/hour.

NOW THE PROBLEM IS-

I am so undisciplined I literally only work/cam for 3-4 hours a WEEK. And I’m SUPPOSED (upon the agreement I made with myself and my boyfriend) to be camming 3-4 hours A DAY. But- I DONT KNOW! Now it’s like time moves 12x slower than it used to just from doing small stupid things like pet the cats, masturbate off cam for fun, take naps, or watch stupid videos on my phone.

The worst part is I’ve been lying to my boyfriend about it.

Today is the last straw- My bf’s already mad at me because I promised I’d be online while he was at the gym for 3 hours. AND EVEN THEN I WAS ONLY ON FOR 59 MINUTES AND MADE $180. So I lied and said I was camming for 1 and a half hours and I thought he’d be cool with just that and me saying I had to go pee or do this or that- but even then the one hour and a half discrepancy had him livid!! He was so angry saying I could have made twice the money I did... he’s never got that angry.

Little does he know I could have made THREE times the money I did.

I can’t keep hiding this and pretend I’m making less to make it seem like I’m working more.

IM JUST SO LAZY AND TIME HAS NO MEANING ANYMORE AND I HAVE ZERO REAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

Not only that. I’m failing two classes now. I have 252 unread texts from my family included. My mom literally texted asking if I was alive yesterday. I still haven’t replied. This lack of discipline is now affecting all areas of my being.

Help me.

HOW DO I GET MY DISCIPLINE BACK??

It was easy when I was a kid and it was literally life or death sleeping on the streets if I wasn’t disciplined, but with all this freedom, there’s no REAL consequence if I’m not disciplined...

Anyone experience something similar, and if so, how the fuck did you get your head out of your ass and into the game?

Then, on your own pace, when you fell that you already do that one thing naturally without thinking of it, find another thing. Repeat that until you meet your needs. Those first things can be very simple ones, like taking out the trash or going out with your dog for a while. Eventually you'll get the hang of it.

TL;DR: having so much responsibility as a kid burned me out as an adult and I’ve picked up bad habits so in result I’m lying to my boyfriend about working more than I am so really I have more free time to procrastinate.";5;"BEST FIX (IMHO):
Where are you going? Pick a destination. (House / career / income level / etc). Then work backwards, working out how you're going to get there, and the intermediate steps. 

Then look at what you're doing right now. School is a great start - opens doors, more income, etc. To make sure you're not in crushing debt, you need to earn. 

You are earning with a goal. Pay rent &gt; get through school &gt; next step up the ladder. 

QUICK FIX:
This is your job. Write down your working hours, lunch break, min/moderate/high sales goals, and holidays/days off. Set your alarm clock and start work ready and in ""uniform"". Clock in with a website like Toggl and work until you clock out. You may want to draft yourself a contract and invite your bf to give his opinions to show you're making an effort. 

Note: Consistency and a ""uniform"" help you get into work mode. In your case it could shower+lingerie+lipstick. 
Note 2: If you need accountability, you might need to set incentives/disincentives. E.g. you donate x amount to your least favourite political party if you're 'late'/'sick 3 days a month'/'not reaching min targets'.

If you keep reducing gradually and consistently you will drastically reduce the withdrawal symptoms.

The other thing I do is try to sleep any time I feel tired.  Caffeine fits into the adenosine receptors.  Adenosine makes you tired.  Caffeine blocks this.  Your body responds by creating more adenosine receptors.  Now it takes more caffeine to reach the same effects.  When you quit suddenly, your body is much more sensitive to the effects of adenosine.  Your body clears adenosine as you sleep.  So I'm trying to sleep whenever and as much as I can while I'm tapering off of caffeine.

I'm starting to notice that I wake up with more energy, and it seems like less coffee is having a stronger effect.

Whenever I quit an unhealthy behavior I find it better to double down on a healthy behavior. You mentioned water but drinking water feels more like a substitute behavior (at least that's how I felt when quitting coffee and later soda)

In my personal experience, focusing on food helps a lot. Like if I eat three well rounded meals, its easier for me to feel better while im quitting coffee. Try looking into stuff like protein and carb intakes to keep your brain functioning. Like eating eggs and oatmeal for breakfast immeditaly starts my day off better.

In very simple terms, caffeine impersonates adenosine (signals your brain you’re drowsy) and binds to its receptors. Drinking so much caffeine, your brain creates more receptors for it to bind to because there’s an excess including adenosine. When you stop caffeine, you feel tired and have bad headaches because the adenosine is binding to more receptors than your brain would typically have if not the regular large influx of caffeine. When you stop, your brain quickly returns it’s receptor count to baseline and you won’t need so much caffeine/any to not feel so goddamn tired. 

I’m relatively caffeine free now, but for 2-3 years I had to have it first thing everyday and multiple times through the day. Especially at work/during graduate school. The headaches and mental grogginess when I didn’t drink it drove me insane. But I realized eventually that after I drank coffee, I would be uncomfortably jittery and have bad anxiety. Used to chalk it up to my own neuroses/“that’s just caffeine,” but it was getting so discomforting for me that I quit. Then my anxiety stopped. I was so much more calm and chill about things naturally. I still get anxiety from time to time but not regularly like when I was drinking coffee multiple times a day, always at least a double/triple shot or a very strong black. For me it was reason enough to avoid drinking so much coffee. The body adjusts fairly quickly in terms of caffeine tolerance. Now if I drink even 1 shot, my body feels the effects so much. So I’ve switched to tea (albeit sometimes a very strong black tea if required). 

Finally, remind yourself why you’re quitting and make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Exercising as an outlet for your frustration helps if you have the capacity to do it at the onset of withdrawal.

The apple cider vinegar cocktail 2x or 3x a day will give you LOTS of energy! They say to use 2 tblspoons of acv in a glass of water with some honey (for taste). I do exactly that, with raw honey, but in hot water - like a tea. And sometimes I'll add a tblspoon of turmeric/date powder called ""golden milk"" in the first cocktail. Great health benefits! After about a week I received a major energy boost. I now shoot out of bed in the mornings! I love coffee and espresso, and I would drink about 3 espresso shots almost every day. This helps me to not drink coffee or at least feel like I don't need it.

Golden Milk $13.00

Adding text up here in this new post so hopefully it doesn't get caught in the spam filter.

&amp;nbsp;

Reddit, I've [28M] had a tumultuous three years. Eating disorder, anxiety disorder, panic attacks, incredibly complicated relationship, deep career soul-searching, etc. But for the past six months I've gotten to a place where everything is really moving smoothly. I've ended the relationship, have been consistently losing weight, exercising, meditation, using cognitive exercises daily, seeing a wonderful therapist, have a wonderful living situation, have a SNRI that is working for me, am treating my sleep apnea, have some great friends and great hobbies, supportive family, and my career is ever-more becoming on track. I'm less fearful and more happy, confident, and honest. I've built a life and routine that are working for me. And I've also learned a lot about myself, where my chronic anxiety and chronic guilt stem from, and have learned techniques to combat and relax them.

&amp;nbsp; 

I really don't want to get this post embroiled in politics itself at ALL (and please don't even try because I'm sure the mods will just delete the entire post, and I am desperate to know what you guys have to say about this issue, in a politically neutral way). I will say that my usual routine for politics is checking several news outlets that I consider to be more neutral daily, checking 538 to see general trends, and being subscribed to /r/politics, /r/bluemidterm2018, /r/conservative, /r/technology, /r/cordcutters, /r/keepournetfree, /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/offbeat, /r/upliftingnews, /r/geopolitics, /r/economics, /r/neutralnews. Though most of these align moreso with my personal politics, they are certainly not neutral. I'm subscribed to /r/conservative as well to try and understand and stay informed on the other side as well.

 &amp;nbsp;

But the thing is, the politics really get to me. They don't derail me, but it definitely alters my mood for the worse. People have told me to just unsub to any political subreddit and to stop reading news, but it's important to me to be politically informed. I don't want big political things to happen without being aware that they are happening, whichever way the spin is. Political discord has reached a phenomenally and historically high level, and conservatives and liberals alike are probably feeling more and more stressed, fearful, angry, confused, tribalist, and combative towards this stuff more than they ever have before in their lives.

 &amp;nbsp;

So without getting into actual politics (and people who support either side of the aisle are probably equally stressed right now and can benefit from this thread), how do you guys find a way to maintain a level of awareness in politics while simultaneously not letting it affect your wellbeing. Do you guys have any cognitive techniques? Routines? Strategies?

The reason I'm suggesting this is because it seems like you're in a positive feedback loop. You have baseline anxiety, and you quell this anxiety by reading the news, but the headlines you read make you more anxious, and the cycle continues.

The problem is, so much of the news online in the electronic format is designed to be glanced at. It's *relying* on your emotional response to get hooked. Clickbait, pop-ups, infinite scrolling, are all designed for you to superficially understand a topic, form a quick emotional response to it, and then move on to the next topic fairly quickly.

Dead tree media (i.e. print) is better for slowing down and staying focused. You don't have a million things competing for your attention like you do on the internet, and the journalism itself is of higher quality. You may also come away with a better understanding of the topic you're reading about since you will have slowed down in the process of consuming the media.";46;0.15384615384615385;[[0.96706397]];[[0.57812086]];-0.5166;0.106;0.7859999999999999;0.10800000000000001;0.7236;0.098;0.836;0.067;-0.033;0.13700454912319318;0.1257239057239057;0.011280643399287471

&amp;nbsp;

Reddit, I've [28M] had a tumultuous three years. Eating disorder, anxiety disorder, panic attacks, incredibly complicated relationship, deep career soul-searching, etc. But for the past six months I've gotten to a place where everything is really moving smoothly. I've ended the relationship, have been consistently losing weight, exercising, meditation, using cognitive exercises daily, seeing a wonderful therapist, have a wonderful living situation, have a SNRI that is working for me, am treating my sleep apnea, have some great friends and great hobbies, supportive family, and my career is ever-more becoming on track. I'm less fearful and more happy, confident, and honest. I've built a life and routine that are working for me. And I've also learned a lot about myself, where my chronic anxiety and chronic guilt stem from, and have learned techniques to combat and relax them.

&amp;nbsp; 

I really don't want to get this post embroiled in politics itself at ALL (and please don't even try because I'm sure the mods will just delete the entire post, and I am desperate to know what you guys have to say about this issue, in a politically neutral way). I will say that my usual routine for politics is checking several news outlets that I consider to be more neutral daily, checking 538 to see general trends, and being subscribed to /r/politics, /r/bluemidterm2018, /r/conservative, /r/technology, /r/cordcutters, /r/keepournetfree, /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/offbeat, /r/upliftingnews, /r/geopolitics, /r/economics, /r/neutralnews. Though most of these align moreso with my personal politics, they are certainly not neutral. I'm subscribed to /r/conservative as well to try and understand and stay informed on the other side as well.

 &amp;nbsp;

But the thing is, the politics really get to me. They don't derail me, but it definitely alters my mood for the worse. People have told me to just unsub to any political subreddit and to stop reading news, but it's important to me to be politically informed. I don't want big political things to happen without being aware that they are happening, whichever way the spin is. Political discord has reached a phenomenally and historically high level, and conservatives and liberals alike are probably feeling more and more stressed, fearful, angry, confused, tribalist, and combative towards this stuff more than they ever have before in their lives.

 &amp;nbsp;

So without getting into actual politics (and people who support either side of the aisle are probably equally stressed right now and can benefit from this thread), how do you guys find a way to maintain a level of awareness in politics while simultaneously not letting it affect your wellbeing. Do you guys have any cognitive techniques? Routines? Strategies?

";299;"For years, I knew that **stress suppresses the immune system**.

Like really, just **being upset suppresses the immune system**.

And yet I still let myself get stressed out by sensationalist health articles.  Like about antibiotic resistant bacteria, for example.

Finally, sometime in 2017, I finally made the connection that I was **shooting myself in the foot**.  Once I realize that it was either my health or staying informed about health - I picked my health and just stayed away from health articles.

Stress dropped significantly.  I felt better.  And slowly, over time - I made more connections.  Following actually pushed me into an existential crises...

**Mere fucking words have a beeline to my immunity system**.  This means that internet trolls can literally make us sick, as in bacterial, fungal, viral sick.

Now, it’s one thing to think that we’re just mentally or emotionally affected.  Quite another to think that every time we’re upset, our immunity system is down.

Upset / stress / flight-fight is for the big enemies that can kill / disable us in minutes.  Our immunity system is for the teeny tiny ones constantly trying to eat us alive slowly.

We get tired after getting upset not just because flight-fight mode is a huge drain but because our immunity system has to take back lost internal ground.  This means inflammation.

**Chronic upset means chronic inflammation**.  Both are expensive... which means more upset.  It’s a fucking stupid **expensive** cycle.

These days, when I read health articles - I’m calm.  These days, when strangers on the internet try to drag me into a d-bate, I kindly inform them that whoever gets upset first loses automatically, just by letting mere fucking words score direct hits on their immune system.

Oh, they get more upset and WILL feel very tired afterwards...  But I stay calm, with my immunity system shielded AND I’m still up to date on sensationalist news articles.

In a nutshell, OP - whenever you feel anxious-upset about politics, think about your immunity system.  Oh, you will feel even more upset but really think about it.  Make the connections and decide which do you value more - your health (and your wallet) or getting upset?";18;0.06020066889632107;[[0.97398786]];[[0.58917349]];-0.5166;0.106;0.7859999999999999;0.10800000000000001;-0.9876;0.071;0.767;0.162;0.08900000000000001;0.13700454912319318;-0.039979213907785326;0.1769837630309785

";299;"I [27F] don’t have much to contribute here other than I feel the same way. I consume a lot of news through work and out of personal interest and that in conjunction with a high stress, emotionally demanding career I find I get overwhelmed with the constant barrage of ‘bad news’. 

I’ve been trying to slow my consumption and instead of checking various sources once an hour, I’ve been trying to restrict it to first thing in the am and maybe once shortly after lunch in the early afternoon. 

I’ve also become a strong avoider, I’ve struggled with similar issues as you, difficult relationship that ended - finishing school and getting into a demanding qualification year to career, anxiety, depression - I get it. So I do a little bit of that, and try to tune it out or glaze over it. It’s not great and I’ve been working with my counsellor to not be so avoidant. 

In the end, not really any insights for you other than - I feel ya buddy. There are good people out there doing good things - let’s get our heads out of the instant gratification of online resources and immerse ourselves in the real world, go for a walk, read some fiction with a coffee at a shop.

";299;"The only way to not get anxious is to minimize the news, unfortunately. Don't feel too personal or too attached to the news.  In this day and age of easily accessible media, it's easy for news/opinions/politics to be exaggerated and go from 0 to 100 for no reason. Just give yourself some detachment. 

Unless the news directly alters your life and lifestyle, don't worry about it. Take a step back. Not everything is worth caring / getting riled up about . 


Sorry if this comes very much like ""just stop caring :)"" but that's literally how I stopped having anxiety over politics and being bitter all the time.

";299;"How *long* do you spend reading your collection of subreddits? 

Simply setting a time limit (and adjusting as necessary) on the exposure you have to the ""stimulus"" of reading distressing material will on your mood.

To improve the efficiency of this, create a multireddit with the subs you want to cover, set a timer, and no matter what happens, don't exceed your time for ingesting this content.

Another thing to consider is whether or not you are simply exposing yourself to event information rather than becoming informed.

For example, you read /r/economics, but what basic economic theory do you know? You are far better off spending any time you might spend on /r/economics actually learning theoretical economics, because economies simply do not evolve on a day-to-day scale. Take the post on the US job numbers. Month to month variations are too narrow a timeframe to be meaningful to anything but a very small cohort of people in the industry. You can't extract meaningful economic trends from point to point variation, but for some people it's their job to rebalance portfolio exposure risk, or speculate on the impact of BLS data on Fed actions. 

I digress, but my point is that educating yourself on the underlying theory and academic knowledge will insulate you against the constant buffeting from articles and threads written to simply get your clicks/karma.

You'll also become far more deeply informed, and not just have the superficial understanding of a news junkie.

I will say that my usual routine for politics is checking several news outlets that I consider to be more neutral daily, checking 538 to see general trends, and being subscribed to /r/politics, /r/bluemidterm2018, /r/conservative, /r/technology, /r/cordcutters, /r/keepournetfree, /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/offbeat, /r/upliftingnews, /r/geopolitics, /r/economics, /r/neutralnews. Though most of these align moreso with my personal politics, they are certainly not neutral. I'm subscribed to /r/conservative as well to try and understand and stay informed on the other side as well.

 &amp;nbsp;

But the thing is, the politics really get to me. They don't derail me, but it definitely alters my mood for the worse. People have told me to just unsub to any political subreddit and to stop reading news, but it's important to me to be politically informed. I don't want big political things to happen without being aware that they are happening, whichever way the spin is. Political discord has reached a phenomenally and historically high level, and conservatives and liberals alike are probably feeling more and more stressed, fearful, angry, confused, tribalist, and combative towards this stuff more than they ever have before in their lives.

 &amp;nbsp;

So without getting into actual politics (and people who support either side of the aisle are probably equally stressed right now and can benefit from this thread), how do you guys find a way to maintain a level of awareness in politics while simultaneously not letting it affect your wellbeing. Do you guys have any cognitive techniques? Routines? Strategies?

";299;"The inflammatory stuff you think is news is not actually news.  It's literally an ""outrage machine"".  That is why you feel anxious.

If you want to stay informed without the whole you-must-be-outraged spin on it, avoid any news that includes opinion.  [Something like this](http://www.euronews.com/nocomment) exists in most places.

";299;"My method is to be fairly selective and limit my news. I read one article about how reading a newspaper or print source is helpful sind you read it until it's finished and then you're done (as opposed to scrolling forever or hitting refresh all day). Few people live a lifestyle where you need to be constantly updated. If you can isolate your news consumption to the important stuff once a day, you can free your mind for the rest of they day. 

I also listen to a lot of NPR which I like since they tend to not be very sensational.

";299;"Online political comments and discussions are some of the most uninformed, emotionally-reactive bile I've ever read. I generally stay away from them. That means, I don't subscribe to any political subreddit.

Instead, I read online newspapers. NYTimes, WaPo, Fox News, Breitbart are my go-to sites in order to get a broad range of news from left to right. Usually, I just read headlines simply to know what those four sites think are the most important, newsworthy events of the day.

Try reading international news sites, such as BBC, Japan Times, South China Morning Post, to find out more about politics outside of the US and foreign views on US politics. US news organizations typically don't feature international affairs as their frontpage material unless those affairs are related to US interests, and their international news sections often leave much to be desired (this even goes for the NYTimes).

So without getting into actual politics (and people who support either side of the aisle are probably equally stressed right now and can benefit from this thread), how do you guys find a way to maintain a level of awareness in politics while simultaneously not letting it affect your wellbeing.

Reddit, I've [28M] had a tumultuous three years. Eating disorder, anxiety disorder, panic attacks, incredibly complicated relationship, deep career soul-searching, etc. But for the past six months I've gotten to a place where everything is really moving smoothly. I've ended the relationship, have been consistently losing weight, exercising, meditation, using cognitive exercises daily, seeing a wonderful therapist, have a wonderful living situation, have a SNRI that is working for me, am treating my sleep apnea, have some great friends and great hobbies, supportive family, and my career is ever-more becoming on track. I'm less fearful and more happy, confident, and honest. I've built a life and routine that are working for me. And I've also learned a lot about myself, where my chronic anxiety and chronic guilt stem from, and have learned techniques to combat and relax them.

&amp;nbsp; 

I really don't want to get this post embroiled in politics itself at ALL (and please don't even try because I'm sure the mods will just delete the entire post, and I am desperate to know what you guys have to say about this issue, in a politically neutral way). I will say that my usual routine for politics is checking several news outlets that I consider to be more neutral daily, checking 538 to see general trends, and being subscribed to /r/politics, /r/bluemidterm2018, /r/conservative, /r/technology, /r/cordcutters, /r/keepournetfree, /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/offbeat, /r/upliftingnews, /r/geopolitics, /r/economics, /r/neutralnews. Though most of these align moreso with my personal politics, they are certainly not neutral. I'm subscribed to /r/conservative as well to try and understand and stay informed on the other side as well.

 &amp;nbsp;

But the thing is, the politics really get to me. They don't derail me, but it definitely alters my mood for the worse. People have told me to just unsub to any political subreddit and to stop reading news, but it's important to me to be politically informed. I don't want big political things to happen without being aware that they are happening, whichever way the spin is. Political discord has reached a phenomenally and historically high level, and conservatives and liberals alike are probably feeling more and more stressed, fearful, angry, confused, tribalist, and combative towards this stuff more than they ever have before in their lives.

";299;I deliberately do not allow anything in my Facebook feed that upsets me. I unfollow each and every person or brand if they make one inflammatory post. I avoid all the political subreddits except banned from (redacted) which keeps me somehow grounded. And lastly I follow Randy Rainbow on FB and Twitter, which enables me to get news tidbits, filtered through the lens of a snarky parody.

";299;"The New York Times published [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html) the other day where the author cut himself off from online news for two months and got it from print sources instead.

This is what he found:

&gt;It has been life changing. Turning off the buzzing breaking-news machine I carry in my pocket was like unshackling myself from a monster who had me on speed dial, always ready to break into my day with half-baked bulletins.

&gt;Now I am not just less anxious and less addicted to the news, I am more widely informed (though there are some blind spots). And I’m embarrassed about how much free time I have — in two months, I managed to read half a dozen books, took up pottery and (I think) became a more attentive husband and father.

Print news happens at a slower pace. It takes time for actual news events to happen, and for events to be reported, written, and properly edited. What ends up in print is less immediate, but it's much more comprehensive, factual, and accurate.

Online news is always churning out streams of new stories. Speed and volume matter take priority, so opinions, twitter reactions, spin, etc., drown out actual facts and acuracy. 

You may not feel you want to switch entirely to print, but there are ways you can change your online news consumption to become less anxiety-inducing. 

Stop relying on reddit, where upvotes curate the news according to each sub's hive mind. Instead, choose a small handful of quality, reliable outlets, spread across the different interests and perspectives you seek.

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/), [The American Conservative](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/), and [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) should give you a good foundation.

";299;"Neutral sources are good, so is regional or local news, as opposed to national.  If you have a pallet cleanser topic like sports or science, that's also helpful in breaking up the narrative, which usually calms me down.

I use an RSS feed reader that follows some google news searches to look for news on specific topics I want to know about (usually what my reps are doing and what our state parties are up to, with some passion topics mixed in) so I don't get waylaid by general rage at drama from the WH or inactivity from Congress.  

It also stops a reliance on news curation from reddit, so I can scan on the site, instead of camping out.  In my darkest moments of anxiety, before politics blew up, reddit was an unhelpful venue because I'd use it to get worked up or procrastinate.  (Pretty good for my writing, though.)  I can't imagine the level of intensity from my r/asoiaf and r/thewalkingdead anxiety uber-focus attached to today's political subreddits.  If that sounds familiar, I'd find a way to cut that back first.

Reddit, I've [28M] had a tumultuous three years. Eating disorder, anxiety disorder, panic attacks, incredibly complicated relationship, deep career soul-searching, etc. But for the past six months I've gotten to a place where everything is really moving smoothly. I've ended the relationship, have been consistently losing weight, exercising, meditation, using cognitive exercises daily, seeing a wonderful therapist, have a wonderful living situation, have a SNRI that is working for me, am treating my sleep apnea, have some great friends and great hobbies, supportive family, and my career is ever-more becoming on track. I'm less fearful and more happy, confident, and honest. I've built a life and routine that are working for me. And I've also learned a lot about myself, where my chronic anxiety and chronic guilt stem from, and have learned techniques to combat and relax them.

&amp;nbsp; 

I really don't want to get this post embroiled in politics itself at ALL (and please don't even try because I'm sure the mods will just delete the entire post, and I am desperate to know what you guys have to say about this issue, in a politically neutral way). I will say that my usual routine for politics is checking several news outlets that I consider to be more neutral daily, checking 538 to see general trends, and being subscribed to /r/politics, /r/bluemidterm2018, /r/conservative, /r/technology, /r/cordcutters, /r/keepournetfree, /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/offbeat, /r/upliftingnews, /r/geopolitics, /r/economics, /r/neutralnews. Though most of these align moreso with my personal politics, they are certainly not neutral. I'm subscribed to /r/conservative as well to try and understand and stay informed on the other side as well.

 &amp;nbsp;

But the thing is, the politics really get to me. They don't derail me, but it definitely alters my mood for the worse. People have told me to just unsub to any political subreddit and to stop reading news, but it's important to me to be politically informed. I don't want big political things to happen without being aware that they are happening, whichever way the spin is. Political discord has reached a phenomenally and historically high level, and conservatives and liberals alike are probably feeling more and more stressed, fearful, angry, confused, tribalist, and combative towards this stuff more than they ever have before in their lives.

";299;"I have found that I can stay informed about major events in my country (Australia) without getting too caught up in the emotion of it by reading the ""world news"" section of overseas news websites. Generally things won't receive overseas coverage unless they're significant enough (which is a great filter), and the reporting tends to be more of a summary of what's happened rather than seeking to influence the reader's view on it (which is common for many local articles).

";299;"I had this problem last year. Following the election I was binging on news and it was consuming my time and energy to little effect. 

I now use curation to stay on top of the major issues without getting too far in myself. 

Your mileage may vary, but this is my routine. 

I bought a waterproof speaker (there are a bunch on amazon, I got one for $15), and I use it to listen to podcasts in the shower. Specifically I listen to “The Daily.” It’s a NYTimes podcast that does a great job of covering the major issues in about 20 minutes. Sometimes it runs long and I end up listening while I eat breakfast and commute. 

If I want more I also add in “Up First” from NPR.

I don’t do anything else. Those two have given me more than I need for the last year to stay informed and it took less than an hour of time where I was already busy with my morning routine of shower, eat, commute.

I really don't want to get this post embroiled in politics itself at ALL (and please don't even try because I'm sure the mods will just delete the entire post, and I am desperate to know what you guys have to say about this issue, in a politically neutral way). I will say that my usual routine for politics is checking several news outlets that I consider to be more neutral daily, checking 538 to see general trends, and being subscribed to /r/politics, /r/bluemidterm2018, /r/conservative, /r/technology, /r/cordcutters, /r/keepournetfree, /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/offbeat, /r/upliftingnews, /r/geopolitics, /r/economics, /r/neutralnews. Though most of these align moreso with my personal politics, they are certainly not neutral. I'm subscribed to /r/conservative as well to try and understand and stay informed on the other side as well.

 &amp;nbsp;

But the thing is, the politics really get to me. They don't derail me, but it definitely alters my mood for the worse. People have told me to just unsub to any political subreddit and to stop reading news, but it's important to me to be politically informed. I don't want big political things to happen without being aware that they are happening, whichever way the spin is. Political discord has reached a phenomenally and historically high level, and conservatives and liberals alike are probably feeling more and more stressed, fearful, angry, confused, tribalist, and combative towards this stuff more than they ever have before in their lives.

 &amp;nbsp;

So without getting into actual politics (and people who support either side of the aisle are probably equally stressed right now and can benefit from this thread), how do you guys find a way to maintain a level of awareness in politics while simultaneously not letting it affect your wellbeing. Do you guys have any cognitive techniques? Routines? Strategies?

";299;"Nothing wrong with wanting to stay informed. Your willingness to read and learn is a really positive attribute. Since you already have this amazing ability to stay informed and read I would also suggest reading up on world history, more specifically biographies about past US Presidents.

What’s really cool is realizing that a lot of the things happening today have happened in the past. It’s cool to get that perspective about what the country has gone through in the past and the personalities at play. It also helps to realize that although things can be tense now, we’ve seen it before, and since the world probably isn’t going to end we still need to go to work and say hello to friends and do our best to be happy.";1;0.0033444816053511705;[[0.94697916]];[[0.52406291]];-0.5166;0.106;0.7859999999999999;0.10800000000000001;0.9863;0.24;0.7440000000000001;0.016;-0.226;0.13700454912319318;0.18699494949494952;-0.04999040037175634

";299;"I'd ask yourself this question: How much news is really worth reading? Staying informed is good, but there's also quite a bit of fluff out there. Do you really need to know every time an ex-politician or celebrity says that they think Trump is bad? Do you need to know new details about OJ simpson (frontpage of /r/news at the moment)? I know it can seem like every story is super pressing and important, but your health and well-being is more valuable.

Another option that I'd suggest is try getting involved in local politics or activism.

";299;If you don't have the mental power to consume the news without anxiety then the answer is simple just don't. Move away by yourself and separate yourself from the news and internet for a year. Get a job in a small town and just focus on the people around you. That's what I did, for a whole 2 years I was blissfully unaware of the world. After the two year I became bored and moved back from a town of 3000 back to Toronto... And now the news doesn't bother me as much, because the time I spent alone got me woke enough to know even though crazy things are happening in the world. All that really does matter are the people directly surrounding me. ;1;0.0033444816053511705;[[0.94597602]];[[0.53076248]];-0.5166;0.106;0.7859999999999999;0.10800000000000001;-0.5216;0.040999999999999995;0.8909999999999999;0.068;0.025;0.13700454912319318;-0.060714285714285714;0.1977188348374789

";299;"Firstly, dude awesome that you turned your live around and that things keep getting better. Congratulations!!

Concerning your problem:
Firstly find out what it is about the news that makes you anxious. A lot of the comments (including myself and probably you as well) are of the opinion that it is the dominance, the amount and the variaty of your news feed. But is there a certain kind of news that affects your mood? (Personal  examples: the u.s. president, the European Union, the environment, the increase of yuppism of dutch cities ;))

Secondly is there a certain type of news you prefer? Do you prefer neutral news or a quick overview, you can take a low key news app to keep up-to-date. Do you want  a daily overview, there are enough sites and YouTube channels tot get a daily overview. Or do you want to take your time for more indept articels and taken a subscription on a newspaper or magazine.

Lastly my advice is to unsubscribe the news subreddits and make Reddit a place to relax for  the things you want to read. Lose the habbit (if you have this habbit :p) to open a news app of site every five minutes and make following the news a concious activity instead of a mindless habit. This way you prepare yourself for the impact the news may have on your mood.


P.s. i want to recommend an article about getting anxious because of your news feed as further reading ;)

I'm subscribed to /r/conservative as well to try and understand and stay informed on the other side as well.

 &amp;nbsp;

But the thing is, the politics really get to me. They don't derail me, but it definitely alters my mood for the worse. People have told me to just unsub to any political subreddit and to stop reading news, but it's important to me to be politically informed. I don't want big political things to happen without being aware that they are happening, whichever way the spin is. Political discord has reached a phenomenally and historically high level, and conservatives and liberals alike are probably feeling more and more stressed, fearful, angry, confused, tribalist, and combative towards this stuff more than they ever have before in their lives.

 &amp;nbsp;

So without getting into actual politics (and people who support either side of the aisle are probably equally stressed right now and can benefit from this thread), how do you guys find a way to maintain a level of awareness in politics while simultaneously not letting it affect your wellbeing. Do you guys have any cognitive techniques? Routines? Strategies?

Thanks so much!

At what point can one just be chill about a politician who petitioned to the Evangelicals sleeping with a porn star and a playboy model, just months from his young baby boy being born.

And that is the least concerning.

My recommendation is to limit the consumption to a summary. And focus on wjat can be done about it - book meetings with your local politicians. Ask them simple questions that make them feel guilty.

""Did you take money from the NRA?
Has that changed your position?

Why not have background checks on mental health and violent crimes?""

You may find this to be a recurring issue; being super motivated and focused, then losing it, then questioning why you do anything at all, then finding a new interest for a while... aaaand repeat.

It doesn't mean anything's _wrong_ but it's definitely uncomfortable. Nor does it mean that it won't end - but when it does, you might not wind up exactly where you were before, with the same motivations, etc.

It's hard to give a shit about tests once they've served their purpose. You did well and now you're past those particular tests. Of _course_ you're not going to be motivated in the same way.

You may also be burned out. It's very common and it's something that you can't **work** yourself out of. That's a difficult thing about burning out; when you feel it coming on, it's time to take a break. If you don't listen to your needs, you'll make it much worse and make it last longer.

My guess is that you need to feed your spirit. The good news is that you already have some ideas. Drawing's a great thing to do; don't assume it's stupid or not worth your time. I'd argue that it's _exactly_ what you should be doing. Or playing games, or bird watching, or climbing trees... anything's fine.

Don't make the mistake of thinking it's all about ""performance"" and ""achievement"" and making your parents happy. You need to make yourself happy too, and make space in your life for things you might enjoy.

I was addicted too. But at that time I could not buy a new one. So I lived without one for a whole month.

The first week was painful and hard, you keep touching your pocket to go and check social media when you don't know what to do... 
You stay on public transport bored, you have no idea of what to do and you feel lost.

After the first week had gone I felt amazing though. I started to notice the world around me, I started reading, I felt less stressed during the day. Overall I felt better! 
After the third and fourth week I didn't feel the need to have a phone, I would never need to pull it out during conversations with friends.. But I did get quite annoyed when they did that :P.

After the month passed I managed to fix my phone, but I did not want to go back to staying on my phone all the time.
I have not stopped reading, and I love to be bored sometimes. To rest the mind is really therapeutic.

Scrolling facebook for 1 hour is so much worse than just doing nothing. When you do nothing you can rest your mind and think about stuff.

Breaking my phone (on accident) was one of the best things that happened to me.

If you don't want to break it, I suggest you give it to someone you can trust.

Here are some random advices that comes in my mind

- change your phone subscription to limit your internet use (at least you would use it less when commuting) 

- put your device in an other room before going to sleep to avoid binge surfing first thing I  the morning 

- actually sell the smartphone and keep the dumb one so you can’t go back unless spending tons of money (sounds like the most extreme but also the most effective one)

For instance: I wait tables for a living.   When I started I was horribly afraid of people having a bad experience, complaining then getting fired.

After a while, and coaching from more experienced people, I learned to not take people too seriously, not take myself so seriously, not take confrontation personally, and how to joke and get along and make good money.

Though I'm good now, I STILL have days where I walk up to a table and my mind is screaming at me to run away.  And I just put that voice in a proverbial box, put it to the side and go about my day.

If you can find a way to be OK even if you don't get the job, that will relieve a lot of the pressure you're putting on yourself. 
Second, if you are qualified for the job, maybe you can focus on the most likely questions on the tests and be prepared with the most likely answers. If you feel you are just as qualified and just as prepared as anyone else, you will be more able to relax and welcome the challenge.

Focus instead on getting better and out-competing your competition.

If you do that, then you will have less uncertainty, doubt, and anxiety with regards to your competition.

You need more confidence, but the only way to get it is to practice and do it more through repetition.

Stop reinforcing the fear of competition, who cares, there's ALWAYS going to be someone better than you. What matters is that you be the best YOU, or keep striving for it.

I have been disciplined, I have been studying, I have been going to the gym albeit skipping a week to study for exams. This week I finished up my last round of midterms. I bombed my first round and not because I wasn't disciplined but because I didn't study the right material and didn't have the right mindset.

This time I believe I did well on one exam but my most important was my engineering exam. I did my best and left it all out on paper but I'll be lucky to get a C on the exam. I am sad, but I know what I have to do and I am very capable of doing better on the final. I am pleased that I have improved and feel better, but I have this nagging feeling in me that I'm not going to be okay this quarter. 

In all honesty, typing this out is making me feel quite emotional. I've always wanted to be an engineering major and this is my first semester/quarter as one after changing majors (which took a lot of hard work).

I have this feeling frequently in med school and with regards to changing a couple eating habits that past-me has had a hard time with. All you can do is acknowledge the feeling, then let it pass you by as you move on to something else. 

In situations where tangible goals (such as engineering exams) are involved and you’re having this feeling, it’s important to assess where you’re at, change something if needed,  write out tangible stuff to get done each day, then do the things! All you can do is work on what’s in your control, which is right-now-you, not future-you. 

Currently feeling this way a few months out from my first round of board exams for med school. I’ve been adjusting how I study and am finally figuring something out that works for me, willingly abandoning an approach if it isn’t producing results. Possibly more importantly, when/if the little voice in my head that tells me I’m probably just going to fail anyway ever speaks up, I just try to let those thoughts pass me by and then continue with the task at hand. Ruminating on my anxiety will surely make me not get my work done, but acknowledging and moving on... that will! 

Beyond that I suggest sleeping enough, exercising if that’s something you enjoy, allocating time for fun stuff, and giving yourself a break! You can do this!!!

Do you have any background in business already? My first thought is that you would best benefit from a mentor that helps people through this transition, or has done so themselves. It's easy to get lost in all of the possibilities in entrepreneurship, but it's important to be able to strip it back to the essentials which are both enriching and rewarding. Is that something of value to you or would you like to go it alone?

If the latter, there are excellent resources around the web for each of those individual questions, and making up a rough plan of even the proposed necessary steps can give you a framework for starting to ask the questions necessary. r/entrepreneur is a great resource, but you'll have to dig a bit for stuff relevant; though top posts is always a great place to start looking for useful thread titles.

But, before you get caught procrastinating trying to learn everything before acting - consider what are the absolute essentials that you need to accomplish this. Even at the trivial levels like:  per piece of Y size I need to spend X hours referencing, drawing, rendering, etc.

Deadlines for the work... 

In terms of setting them, it really depends on the type of person you are tbh. 

Do you get stressed out and produce lower quality work when in a frenzied state, or do you step up to the plate and do some crazy shit?

If the former then set deadlines with extra time as buffer so you get to hack away at the work a little bit at a time.

The latter, make sure you set deadlines for clients or whatever that are slightly ambitious (not so much!) but enough to get your ass moving and not waste time.

Accountability... 

Finding someone else who is doing the same would help or similar. Otherwise having your partner hold you accoutnable - but not everyone is good at this so really depends on your partner.

Other thing is simply doing anti-charity bets, so if you don't hit the deadline on certain tasks you gotta donate a certain amount of money to a charity you hate (can look into stickk for this, there's others too).

The other thing is that when you WANT to do something (but lets face it we don't ALWAYS want to), its much easier to meet deadlines or push for it and stick to a plan of action.

List out all the reasons why you want to go FT solo/freelancing, remind yourself of them daily. Envision what it will be like when you're your own boss and running the show and calling the shots etc

A mentor or coach can also help tremendously with all of the above!

Paid or unpaid.

Hope this was of some help

edit: 

Deadlines can be tough man, but just set something to begin with and stick to it then after assess how you could have improved. What took up too much time, or did you dedicate too much time to the task etc. 

Just keep adapting and be flexible with your plans and most of ALL learn and grow from what you do. There's no perfect plan in business remember this. It might not be plan 1, plan 2, plan 3, or even plan 4 that gets you there, but it might just be plan 5 does.

So you gotta keep working the plan as well as planning the work.

My day starts at 6:30am I go to the gym go to class at 9:30/10:00 every day and then go to the library. When I go I always tell myself I need a break to start which can end up being the whole day. The latest I have class is until 3:30 and then I stay at the library until 6:30pm then go home. Even then I still get nothing done. And weekends I'm always with my girlfriend so I don't work, but I have more than enough time durning the week to finish everything. I went home early last sunday and I tired to work on my homework from 12pm-7pm. In that time I got home problem done. Every time it gets hard I just stop and browse the web. I can't keep doing this or i'm going to fail, classes are getting much harder. Every semester I say I'm going to fix it, but never do. I actually say it every morning and then same thing happens. I'm so slow at learning, it feels like I can't understand it too. I just really wish I could go to class stay at the library until 6:00pm get everything done and go home and relax, but I always end up staying up for my homework still.

Anyway, what are some tips to really help fix me. I've tried a lot of stuff. I know there is no magic way to fix it, I just want some advice or an accountability partner or something.

TL;DR I'm lazy as can be, don't get my homework/studying done. What would you guys recommend.";2;"Break it down and clearly define what you need to do when you sit down to study. 

Make sure those broken chunks of what you need to do are in short bursts, say 10-25 minutes.

Focus with all your might during those 10-25 minutes to keep going on it until it gets finished.

When it does, take a break BUT the caveat is you don't take a break bloody surfing the web and internet. You take a break by going for a walk, doing something physical such as jumpin jacks, squats, or pushups, or going to toilet, drink fountain etc.

YOu can even take a break by doing deep breaths, meditating, or closing your eyes.

Stop doing stuff you fall into the trap of distractions and procrastinating as your breaks.

Also take note that it isn't about the quantity of hours you spend studying, it is MORESO about the quality of hours. I would suggest you aim for 1 or 2 hours of quality study each day or every 5 days of the week, that is actually really hard to do but its a good stepping stone.

When you actually have concentrated focus, it is somewhat amazing to notice how well you can do things, whereas if its 2 hours of lackluster focus, its just wasted.

You likely could have done the same thing in 30 minutes of focused effort.

It's pretty simple: **Do you want to be struggling and not have the ability to go places, buy things, or do hobbies you love in the future?** Let's say you screw around all college, graduate, but with low GPA. Don't land a good job. Have to work your way up making $30k/year. Hell, maybe you don't graduate and just come up with no degree and debt. Now that sucks.

Or you could apply yourself now for 4 years. Land a good job due to it. Work your butt off at it and have money to do the things you want. Could be traveling, could be a new TV and video game systems anytime you want, could be a new car, whatever it is. At the very least, just having money stashed away is calming and allows you to focus on other things in life like enjoyment and happiness, rather than fretting about paying bills.

You actually already seem to know what to do. Make a plan and try it out. Set small subgoals, prioritize. How often and how much you should practice depends on the skill you are learning and I'm sure you can find specific advice on the Internet. You already know your feelings of guilt are not logical.

As a baseline for goal setting you could go with something like this:


Motivation: why do I want to learn this, why will I keep going even when it's difficult, how does learning this suit the things I value in life? What do I have to sacrifice to learn this skill and is it worth it?


Goal: Be able to read the news in a different language, play a song on guitar, write a book. Keep it simple and remember that getting to the goal isn't the point - the process will improve you and that's what is important.


Smaller goals: practice for 20 minutes. Make goals that are not about your progress but about spending time. You have to feel good about practicing or you will drop it after a week.

Ok, first - what I'm about to say has a pretty good chance of shoving you into an existential crisis.  If it does, bear with it.  Think about what discipline is... it's getting used to uncomfortable stuff.

If you can get through an existential crisis calmly, you level up in discipline.  It even has awesome perk - decreases pride (hardened neural wiring), increases humility (flexible neural wiring).

K... here it goes.

We've got limited brain attics.  I actually learned about this from Sherlock Holmes.

&gt; I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it **there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before**. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.

This shit is real.  This is why kids learn way faster than adults - they've got emptier brain attics to begin with.  (Also, why kids are more easily brainwashed.)

We also automatically forget more than 90% of everything experienced... that's why we can't even remember our childhoods.  Heck, OP - just try to remember what you did yesterday.  It's a fucking blur.

Now... do you really need to learn a new language?  Are you planning to be a translator?  Cause you know... Google Translate is kinda eating up that market...

[Need Advice] Stop Being Entitled to Good Grades;t3_86v1hf;2;"Since the beginning of the school year I have not been as proactive as I should be with school.

Receiving the B+ doesn't really matter unless it's going to put your future goals in jeopardy. Ask yourself if the procrastination is worth such a result. 

Also, this seems weird but I read somewhere about a girl who photoshopped her future self as the person she was striving to become. (Maybe as a doctor I think?) Anyway, she put the picture somewhere she could see it daily and remind herself of her ultimate future goal, and it actually helped improve her studying habits. Maybe you could do something like this too. You get the benefit of having a constant reminder and having an extremely concrete visualization of your goal.

Truly, the Worst Case Scenario is that someone doesn't understand you and things are a bit awkward but try to imagine that moment a year or two from now - you probably won't remember that person and they're definitely not going to remember you.

You'll notice the anxiety likely dissipate. Then do it the next day, then the next, then just increasing the time you spend outside.

You'll realize it ain't all that bad!

Then hit up the skate park and just skate, there's a lot more to communicating then languages. And you'll probably find some others who can actually speak English.

Just slowly get out there each day man and stop holing yourself up at home!!!

Literary I have been poor to a certain extent but continued and recently I got graduated and have gone to a dozen interviews. But I got rejected in most of them. Those who accepted me told me I should work for free but they have terrible conditions. 
I would say I have skills such as content writing(if I am provided with good guideline, I mean they tell me exactly what they want!), I can design different stuff with adobe software, I can transalte.

I was once in your position. I picked the route that was easiest + get me the most money. So I went with economics. I now know this is a shitty life. You will be much happier with a field and job that you love. You will spend 7/7 days enjoying your days instead of 2/7. You will look forward to the next day everyday, instead of dreading it. You will come back from work energized and happy, not depleted. You will be inspired and excited. Taking 60% of the pay is worth it, as living a life of inspiration, passion, excitement, creativity, altruism and love will give you more happiness than a pay of a million USD. a year. 


Find the subject that you are most passionate about. Keep asking that question and get closer and closer to the answer. Keep testing things out. By the time you leave college you'll have your answer. Do not wait until the last minute. 

Don't worry about your major and picking it wrong. You can get any job you want nowadays if you have experience. And, degrees are getting less and less meaningful as more and more people have them. 


For example, if you were an english major and want to do comp sci later in life: In 6 months: Do a 3 month super intense programming bootcamp (they will fit your college degree in this time), write an app and create a website and monetize them and you'll have more EXP than a college graduate. 


If you're comp sci and want to do english later in life: in 6 months: write an article a day about a topic you're passionate about, read several books about writing and keep improving your writing skills everyday. 3 months in, give your articles to popular websites and eventually one will hit and you will be a regular. You will then have a massive body of experience for a job. more than you need. 


Your future will depend on your hard work + creativity. You can build experience yourself in nearly  any field 


Read the book the big leap. It'll answer your very question and show you what to do for your future.";3;0.75;[[0.97651193]];[[0.58096132]];0.5908;0.105;0.7959999999999999;0.099;0.9964;0.204;0.758;0.038;-0.15999999999999998;0.10881090808416387;0.17586805555555554;-0.06705714747139166

The best thing to do in your situation is to not blame yourself or the people around you, but find an inanimate object in which you lay all your problems. Some sort of jewelry or useless object you can throw away when you need to blame something for your problems. This would help you see how your problems are perishable that at moments is hard to observe as a first person. It has helped me surpass some of my previous faults without to having to curse at the skies or regret words and animosity that might make your problems even more complex.

First of all as teenager for some people when they grow up, they don’t get enough credit and respect from their family. I think this whole circumstance is normal 
When you show them your path and show them that you know how to do things, they’ll try to respect you. This is somehow unfair but that’s how it is.
Second of all Forget about your class mates for now. Just focus on your sources. if this is very demanding for you, divide each page into small paragraphs and read them in interval sessions. Do 15 min study 20 min rest later you can change this.
Prepare yourself to volunteer in the class for sure. Show your abilities to the others no matter how small they are.
Prepare one or two GOOD questions for the lab to ask from your instructor.
Write one small paragraph at the end of class about your progress, things that you learned and need to improve.

";2;"Cut down the list and focus on the most important ones.

You may also find that some are already habits/ingrained for you so there is no more need to keep it on your to-do list/keep checking it off.

You could also BATCH them together if you wish, so batch first 1/3 of tasks together into ONE thing ""get ready for day"" - might include brushing, shower, toilet, drinking etc.

""Importants for morning"" - stretching, meditation, journal etc

So this way you only get 3 things you ""have"" to-do

You could try setting a long term schedule.
If you want to do X thing, you set up a date by which you'll complete your task.
For example let's say you want to write a book. Instead of saying 'I should really start writing soon',  you decide that one month from now you'll write your first chapter.

I've found it really helpful, because I can actually visualize WHEN I'll do X, not just some nebulous future. I don't always succeed, but at least I have done something: maybe instead of studying 100 pages I've studied 75, but it's better that what I did before (that is, wake up every day panicking because I had to do a lot of things, and then screw up because 'well I've got a lot of time to study Y!

Or at the least plan what you will do the next day that you wake up - regardless of the time.

I would suggest try getting out the house straight away to do some exercise and see the world a bit. Can be a short walk, ride, or even a run. 

Come back and then have a productive morning routine to run through, whether that's meditating, journaling, planning the day ahead and what you intend to do etc.

This way you are more intentional rather than reactive and just fall into bad habits where you just waste time sitting around etc.

Just play around with it and see what happens :)";1;0.2;[[0.95271147]];[[0.74173582]];0.9712;0.158;0.79;0.053;-0.0;0.059000000000000004;0.8909999999999999;0.051;0.09699999999999999;0.03154166666666666;0.028571428571428588;0.0029702380952380744

Any advice would be hugely appreciated!";5;"I really struggled to get things done before I had a set work schedule so I feel your pain.  It’s hard to get an actual routine that way since you’re constantly up and out at different and unpredictable times but if you tack things onto the beginning and end of your work day it helps. In other words instead of trying to make a morning routine, make a “getting ready for work routine”. By clumping all your responsibilities into one activity with your job, it won’t matter what time you work or get home because it’s just part of your work day. You won’t have to feel guilty about sleeping in as long as you have time to get ready for work. 

One thing I would do is set my alarm for 15 minutes the second I got home from work before I took of my shoes and clean until the alarm went off. And I say clean lightly because sometimes it was things like sorting the mail, balancing my accounts, or start cooking dinner but basically 15 minutes of productivity before I was allowed to take off my shoes, watch tv, order take out and smoke pot haha.  Usually once I started I would keep going until I finished the task at hand even if the 15 minutes were up. But This helps keep my apartment pretty clean and I almost never need to clean outside of my daily 15. 

Another thing that helps is doing things by day. So say you carve out an hour and a half of time to get ready for work and do your routine. 30 minutes for all the normal things like showering, brushing your teeth, etc, plus. 30 minute productivity time slot that can be different every day. Maybe Monday’s you do mail, bills and take out the trash but on Tuesdays you work out and Wednesday you take the extra time to make your self a nice breakfast.  If you’re more alert and productive at night, schedule more difficult tasks at night. Because most stores are closed when you get off make sure things like grocery shopping or going to the post office for the mornings. 

There are also little things you can do like make a large crockpot meal before work one day before work so dinner is ready and waiting when you get home with three or 4 meals worth of left overs. You can even leave the dishes in the sink overnight guilt free because you know you’ll clean them in your 15 after work. 

Sometimes if I really just want to spend my whole day in bed I will but I’ll set an alarm for an arbitrary time to do a 15 minute burst of productivity and usually once I’m up and moving around I just keep going until I’m done";1;0.2;[[0.97244495]];[[0.76346399]];0.9712;0.158;0.79;0.053;0.9962;0.16399999999999998;0.787;0.049;-0.009999999999999995;0.03154166666666666;0.11244708994708996;-0.0809054232804233

Thanks for your time.";219;"For me, it was the realization that I simply think too much. Once I felt my thoughts overflow, I stopped and tried to acknowledge a present fact in my current environment. For example, ""the wall is bumpy. "" Its completely random, but it brings you back to the present. If it doesn't do it for you right away, continue to note visual facts of your environment until you realize you're no longer thinking about the bad things. 

Once you are out of the bad, remind yourself of at least ONE good thing about yourself. If you can't, that is okay. The important part is to try at all.

What I noticed for myself as well is that focusing on everything that's wrong with me never got anything done or did me good. When you are relaxed and in a good mood, make a plan for a short term goal. For example, if there's a habit you want to work on, aim to do that habit at least once a week or day. (I'd recommend once a week first!) Don't overwork yourself when you're introducing yourself to a new habit.

What helps as well is pushing aside my negative emotions and lack of motivation and just mindlessly getting into a task. For example, this morning I did not want to work out. However, I knew I needed to in order to maintain and improve my strength. So what did I do? I just got up and got dressed. I didn't like it, and it took me awhile to get started on the workout, but I didn't spend too much time thinking. I acted instead. 

Every day will get easier and every step you take towards getting better is an accomplishment in itself. Never belittle the steps you take, because they are not baby steps. What I learned recently is that every step you take is not little. It's huge and it's much better than where you were just a while before.  Accept that there will be fallbacks and that it also will not be the end unless you choose to let it be. 

Let me inform you that this is my second time getting back into working out. I lost a lot of weight before but I ate unhealthily. I was malnourished and always lightheaded. To the point that I fainted once. Then, I got into a relationship and let myself go. Then I reached a point where I pitied myself and decided if I wanted the body I had before, I needed to put in the work. You have to ask yourself if you are okay with where you are. Be honest with yourself. If you are, then accept it and move on. If you aren't okay with where you are, then make a plan to do something about it. 

Stop bad thoughts with acknowledging your environment.
Don't belittle yourself.
Acknowledge every step you take in the positive direction as an accomplishment.
Make plans when you are happy and relaxed, not when you're overwhelmed and stressed. (It's needed to think clearly!)
Be honest with what YOU want, not what's expected of you.

This was the one thing which allowed me to process from random stints of failed discipline to steadily improving my happiness with my life. You will relapse into bad habits and that's ok. The important thing is to recognise that you've slipped and try again and recognise that failing is human  and part of learning. As long as your trying it's ok.

Also as a side note, med school tends to be a toxic environment. Try and make friends outside of medicine or with interns an registrar's (Australian/UK, not sure if US has  the same stages). Realise that is ok to struggle and fail as long as you learn.

There's a plethora of great advice here and all over the internet on how to get disciplined and start building good habits but like most people visiting this subreddit, I still can't do it. I know I should study, exercise, meditate and have a good sleep schedule but I forgo that for the instant gratification of masturbation and video games. At times theres been periods where ive been slightly disciplined but I always fall back into bad habits eventually. And over time, constantly failing at becoming disciplined has discouraged me more and more over time to the point where I get quite depressed at my wasted potential. I am quite fortunate that I somehow got into med school straight from high school but I'm barely scraping through basically never studying (I've failed some subjects as well). I have no high goals in medicine because I know I'm lazy and ive failed so many times to get disciplined. I'm now worried for my future patients because they would have an incompetent doctor taking care of them but not worried enough to do something about it.

I used to be reasonably athletic and lift weights but I am again in a period of being lazy and having no discipline whatsoever.

I assume most of you guys that have become disciplined tried and failed a few times before eventually getting it all right. What turned it around for you guys?

I know the things I should be doing but the voice that's telling me I can't and that I won't amount to anything is growing louder as the years go by that I'm lazy and undisciplined. Every year I buy a diary thinking I will write down goals and things to do everyday and by the end of the year, that diary is blank. I know I should take baby steps and I've done so in the past but I always end up back in the same position if not worse. Its analogous to being stuck in a maze and not wanting to move because you've ended in the same place over and over again and now you just want to give up completely.

I definitely have failed a lot to get to where I am, and I continue to fail even further. The thing to realize is that failing isn't a bad thing, it's a great thing. As long as you look at it and take it the right way

What changed it around for me was the thought of ""making"" it but when I made it with the girlfriend, great job, money, and time I felt like shit.

It was all so hollow, so meaningless, and so damn unfulfilling. At the start I did what most people do, I just distracted myself with all the things you can possibly distract yourself with.

Tv shows, movies, events, going out, drugs etc.

But it all comes back to the same empty feeling and voidness.

And then I crashed my car, it got totalled and that was a pretty good shake up.

Made me realize that we really don't have an infinite amount of time - despite how many of us act as if we do. I could have easily died that day if not for luck but I survived.

Funnily enough, it was on the way to my first 10 day meditation retreat - I'm glad and ever so grateful that I was still able to attend. You can guess what kind of thoughts were on my mind throughout those 10 days

When I came back I just made the decision. A real decision.

There was no more of the excuses, no more repeating the same mistakes, going around in circles not getting anywhere.

I defined exactly what I wanted and I vowed to myself that I was going to do everything within my power to get what I wanted. It was either that or I die.

No more excuses, no more bullshit, no more wasting time.

Throw everything against the wall until something works and I eventually found something that works.

Never giving up is one key that unlocks it all.

The other one is simply being self-aware enough and reflecting on where your shortfalls are and not tolerating any ""badness"" in that area. Constantly improving, getting feedback, and reiterating until you get to where you want to go.";6;0.0273972602739726;[[0.98446921]];[[0.67453631]];-0.5887;0.11599999999999999;0.764;0.12;-0.9679;0.12300000000000001;0.705;0.172;0.045;0.05333702473237358;0.058191609977324275;-0.004854585244950693

Thanks for your time.";219;"So here is my 2 cent on the topic.

But before that:

I saw someone suggested to start with a sleep schedule and wake up early.

I just completely disagree.

Waking up early every day is tedious and requires a lot of discipline. And this is exactly where you need improvement so if you are not disciplined now, you will fail with this very soon.

And we don't want that.

You need small wins immediately to boost your confidence in yourself.

So the wrong way to attack the problem is to try to eat that elephant at once.

My suggestion is to engineer the process on a smart way towards success.

What does it mean?

As I mentioned you need small wins immediately.

You have to be creative on this because there are tremendous ways how to do that.

You mentioned you purchased a planner or something like that because you have goals you want to achieve but finally that planner stayed empty. ( I can't recommend any product which will solve your problem because there's no product that can solve this issue)

I don't know you but there is a good chance that :

1. You don't know how to reach a goal  ( So you need to learn about that)

2. You just over thinking, meaning you are wondering much more than needed and taking action is just in the background 

3. You have the wrong tribe ( you need to find people who constantly improve themselves, motivates you, lift you up, and inspire you to take action)

4. You don't have a ""core life philosophy"" which drives you. ( for example mine is that succes and being productive is not an option in my life, it's my main responsibility because if I don't do stuff which moves me forward on a daily basis I feel myself terrible. So the only way to keep away myself from this shit is when I work on my goals a little bit every day and I feel real satisfaction)

5. You are 23. You have plenty of time in life and you know it. This is a problem when productivity and work ethic comes in. You have to act like if you were 55 and have only 5 years more to make some miracle. You have to work with a mindset of urgency. I know it's totally uncomfortable but only one person can decide to deal with it, and that's you.

I want you to know that you have the willpower NOW to make a change. 

And if you feel you don't want to do it for yourself, than do it for your future family, your beautiful future children and your beautiful future wife. Or you know what? Do it for us! Do it for others who are in the same situation all over the world right now! Take responsibility and show them that it is possible! 

And the world will be grateful for you!

I don't know you, but I believe in you and I am rooting for you!

Good luck and let me know how you progress!

TheProductivityGuy 

Ps.: check the ifocus business planner on Amazon.com if you come up with a business idea or a project or goal. That one is great to increase the chances to reach the goal you want this year. I use it so maybe we can continue to connect with each other and share some experiment.

Thanks for your time.";219;"I've read and been inspired by stories of that sudden epiphany and a complete 180° lifestyle turnaround. That wasnt me. It was very slow changes over time. Sometimes making the change for a week only to revert back for three weeks and try again for a week then revert back for two months. 

Determination. Constantly trying to try. That's what it was. It was celebrating those weeks where I did make the change, and not beating myself up when I reverted, though still reminding myself ""this isnt the change you keep wanting."" Eventually, a change would last two weeks. Or three. Or Od wake up one day and realize id kept it up for a month. Then id make a new change, and maybe this one would stick sooner. So then another change.

Thanks for your time.";219;"I had no fallback. No plan B. No skills to pay the bills. No money. No trust fund. Parents were supportive in their own way but didn’t have the means or desire to let me live in their basement for the rest of my life.

I was still young and able to take out student loans. Those two facts were my single biggest resources. I was very fortunate to have them, and I knew it, because I could see, really see, how close I was to having nothing, and how impossible it would be to fix it if I used those up with nothing to show for it. So, I discovered I had feet and guts and will and no other choice.

Fear is a powerful motivator. 

You’re maybe not in that position. But I’ll give you some tips based on my experience:

1. Feed yourself motivational propaganda. And nothing else. Apple Music has a playlist called “beast mode” that’s basically just some guys yelling motivational speeches over a soft, triumphant background. “NO EXCUSES. HARD WORK BEATS TALENT. I WILL EMBRACE THE STRUGGLE”. That’s your new soundtrack.

2. Cancel cable, sell the video games or drop them at goodwill or give them away. You don’t have time for that shit anymore. Stop tempting yourself. Don’t think “I’ll cancel them and box them up when I can resist using them”. You don’t tell an alcoholic to go ahead and keep buying beer, but just consume less until he doesn’t want it anymore. Garbage in, garbage out. Get rid of that shit. If the beer is there, you will drink it. Yep you’re gonna go through withdrawal and it’s gonna suck. No it’s not easy. Stop using that as an excuse. Make the choice. No one can make it for you.

3. Get scared. Fear is a powerful motivator. Tap into it. What scares you? Look at your student loan situation. Are you in deep? What if you can’t pay it back? Will your parents bail you out- ah, but parents age, and need expensive healthcare, and have their own retirement to fund- they can’t really afford it can they? And would they be disappointed, What about your personal life- who’s going to want to build a life with a masturbating video game addict? What about your professional life- how exactly will you feel the first time a patient dies due to your incompetence? Whatever scares you the most, picture it, really picture it and visualize it and imagine it and feel it. And use it to propel you in the other direction, like a dog biting the heels of a rabbit.

4. Konmari your shit to get rid of every other distraction in your life. Obsessed with how you look? You now only wear white shirts and khaki pants. With meal prep? You now eat the same simple healthy menu every week. With friends? Keep only the friends that support your new lifestyle, the rest of the jokers aren’t real friends and aren’t worth the effort. Streamline. Routine. Minimalist. Free up your energy and efforts to put them elsewhere. 

5. Keep going. Get the fuck up and keep going. Remember that dog of fear on your heels. It’s not time to rest yet. Keep. Going.

Thanks for your time.";219;"Slow and steady wins the race. I had the all-or-nothing attitude all my life and the problem is that you have to be perfect for that to work out, and nobody is. You think you're saving time that way, but you're not because you'll fall off the wagon and then lose what little progress you made by beating yourself up for failing. Rinse and repeat. I lived this lifestyle for years and it got me nowhere.

The past 4 years I've accomplished more than I did in my entire life, simply because I was less strict and allowed myself to fail, as long as I'd get back up in the saddle again. 

This way, I managed to lose the excess 20lbs of fat I was carrying. Took me a year of slowly and steadily building healthy eating habits. The all-or-nothing me had tried to do this through shortcuts (6 week crash diets) without success, for years.

All-or-nothing me tried to pump hard in the gym 5 days a week. Guess what happened: after the initial month or so I'd injure myself or burn myself out, and lost all my progress because I really do not like doing it and making myself go cost me a lot of willpower every day. Now I know that going to the gym is not for me. 

Instead, I took up sports. I now do rock climbing, fencing and yoga. These three things combined cost about as much as my super expensive gym membership, and it's so much more fun. As a result, I actually look forward to going and I exercise much more. 

I also managed to get certificates for subjects I felt I was deficient in, while working full-time. How I did it? I set aside study time every day. I'm not saying I didn't fall off the wagon a couple of times. I did. There were days where I just did not have the energy to study. But instead of beating myself up over it, I made arrangements to do better next time. For example, I've found that if I go to a coffee place or a library to study, I actually get stuff done. At home I get distracted too easily. 

Basically, what I would do is to identify your weaknesses. What are the things you do/ places you stay at, that sap most of your productivity? I found that home for me was a place where I can just lie down on a couch and watch netflix. Trying to be productive there just didn't work. Why fight yourself? 

Also, what really helped me with my studies is basically staying at campus longer to get some homework done. That way you get to go home feeling like you did something. Also, review coursework before the new day, so you have the opportunity to identify the stuff you don't understand yet. That way you can get an answer to that at the actual class instead of afterwards. And lastly, actively listen to your professors. This sounds like a no-brainer but I found I retain a lot from active listening, and it basically cut study-time in half for me.

[Need Advice] What finally turned it around for you guys?;t3_81nqsd;50;"Hi guys,

23 yo male here. There's a plethora of great advice here and all over the internet on how to get disciplined and start building good habits but like most people visiting this subreddit, I still can't do it. I know I should study, exercise, meditate and have a good sleep schedule but I forgo that for the instant gratification of masturbation and video games. At times theres been periods where ive been slightly disciplined but I always fall back into bad habits eventually. And over time, constantly failing at becoming disciplined has discouraged me more and more over time to the point where I get quite depressed at my wasted potential. I am quite fortunate that I somehow got into med school straight from high school but I'm barely scraping through basically never studying (I've failed some subjects as well). I have no high goals in medicine because I know I'm lazy and ive failed so many times to get disciplined. I'm now worried for my future patients because they would have an incompetent doctor taking care of them but not worried enough to do something about it.

I used to be reasonably athletic and lift weights but I am again in a period of being lazy and having no discipline whatsoever.

I assume most of you guys that have become disciplined tried and failed a few times before eventually getting it all right. What turned it around for you guys?

I know the things I should be doing but the voice that's telling me I can't and that I won't amount to anything is growing louder as the years go by that I'm lazy and undisciplined. Every year I buy a diary thinking I will write down goals and things to do everyday and by the end of the year, that diary is blank. I know I should take baby steps and I've done so in the past but I always end up back in the same position if not worse. Its analogous to being stuck in a maze and not wanting to move because you've ended in the same place over and over again and now you just want to give up completely.

Thanks for your time.";219;Honestly for me i always found myself wasting most of my time on video games. When i had moments of non laziness and started what i really wanted to do  was when my console was broken.  So after a saturday that i played 8 hours of video games when i intended on only playing 1 maybe 2 hours i realised sacrifice will be needed for change.  I took my PS4 along with all my games to gamestop and handed them to a father and his son who looked like they were down on their luck.  Unsubscribed from all youtube videos that wasted my time except for a few i enjoyed watching but they don't post videos too often.  I stopped following  a good amount of subreddits that also wasted my time.  Then i used boredom and good deeds  as fuel to get me back on the track i felt i should have always been on.  I now read daily, currently taking a few online classes, exercise more, eat healthier, and actually do the chores around my apartment which makes my wife much happier.  So my advice is cut out the things that hold you hostage and find whatever fuel that will get you on track and keep you there.   ;2;0.0091324200913242;[[0.98382873]];[[0.53586777]];-0.5887;0.11599999999999999;0.764;0.12;0.7311;0.11;0.81;0.081;-0.03299999999999999;0.05333702473237358;0.1272222222222222;-0.07388519748984862

Thanks for your time.";219;"Hopefully I can add something that’s different here. 
I’m also 23 and I graduated from university last year and in that year, I’ve applied for around 500 jobs and got squat...

At the end of last year, I started thinking about killing myself and almost did it because I just didn’t know what else to do. I felt like such a failure and I felt like everyone thought the same thing about me. 

I reached my breaking point and I knew I had to make things better and nobody else was going to do it for me. 
I started therapy, started sleeping and eating better and got my mojo back! I feel way better about the future, I’m not beating myself up for not having a job and I’m applying for them like a woman possessed!

I’m still a work in progress and I still don’t have a job, but I don’t take rejection personally anymore, I’m looking at jobs I actually WANT to do and I finally feel happy again!

Hang in there, start small and remember this - when you look back on this a year from now, you’ll wish you’d started now.

Thanks for your time.";219;I think that, much like a diet, the key is to do things that are sustainable. Make small changes, and stick to them. You’ll find your habits progressively easier. The other key is to accept that you’re human and that slipping up doesn’t mean you start back at square one. Another helpful thing is having someone that’ll give you shit if you don’t show up to a workout, etc.. This can be a friend, S.O., or personal trainer.

- as often as you can during the day think of the person you want to be or something you'd like to achieve and get excited about it.  Picture it finished or you achieving it and feed into that image excitement and color and how you will feel.  
- I wake up at 5am, go for a 5min walk, have coffee and then hit the gym. If I restock my gym bag with the clothes I'll get dressed into as soon as I wake up,  my water bottle, etc. The alarm goes off and I don't have the think.

[Need Advice] What finally turned it around for you guys?;t3_81nqsd;50;"Hi guys,

23 yo male here. There's a plethora of great advice here and all over the internet on how to get disciplined and start building good habits but like most people visiting this subreddit, I still can't do it. I know I should study, exercise, meditate and have a good sleep schedule but I forgo that for the instant gratification of masturbation and video games. At times theres been periods where ive been slightly disciplined but I always fall back into bad habits eventually. And over time, constantly failing at becoming disciplined has discouraged me more and more over time to the point where I get quite depressed at my wasted potential. I am quite fortunate that I somehow got into med school straight from high school but I'm barely scraping through basically never studying (I've failed some subjects as well). I have no high goals in medicine because I know I'm lazy and ive failed so many times to get disciplined. I'm now worried for my future patients because they would have an incompetent doctor taking care of them but not worried enough to do something about it.

I used to be reasonably athletic and lift weights but I am again in a period of being lazy and having no discipline whatsoever.

I assume most of you guys that have become disciplined tried and failed a few times before eventually getting it all right. What turned it around for you guys?

I know the things I should be doing but the voice that's telling me I can't and that I won't amount to anything is growing louder as the years go by that I'm lazy and undisciplined. Every year I buy a diary thinking I will write down goals and things to do everyday and by the end of the year, that diary is blank. I know I should take baby steps and I've done so in the past but I always end up back in the same position if not worse. Its analogous to being stuck in a maze and not wanting to move because you've ended in the same place over and over again and now you just want to give up completely.

Thanks for your time.";219;"Start with a ""trojan horse"", i.e. an easy to do habit which will build up positive effects in short time. This will motivate you to act according to a longer term gratification.

Then try to become proficient in something by doing small steps **daily**, without exceptions. This will teach you that daily small steps make a huge difference within a year or more.

Also, the most powerful approach for getting disciplined is to ignore yesterday and tomorrow and focus on today, because a habit ignored today is technically ignored forever. The tip is: tell yourself that (e.g.) if you don't make your bed today, you will never make your bed and you will be that man who has his bed undone for the rest of your life.

Thanks for your time.";219;"This behaviour is typical when it was someone else's wish that you finish a med school. You can try to figure out when this behaviour started, tracing your attitude to the event that convinced you that these are ""the things you should be doing"", but it's even more important to figure out your true goals and to take responsibility for achieving them.

Turn the computer off and sit in silence focusing on the problem until you get somewhere with it. Do it today.

I also recommend dr Jordan Peterson's Future Authoring program. It's easier to do than facing yourself on your own because it makes the problem structured - it leads you by the hand - and if you stumble on one of the questions you will know where exactly the problem hides.

Thanks for your time.";219;Get rid of the voice that tells you you can’t. Unless you’re schizophrenic, every voice in your head is yours and under your control. Every time you hear that voice, tell it that it’s wrong and then reminds yourself that you are smart and competent and capable and that for whatever reason, you’re making a choice not to do these things. Take back control and stop setting yourself up for disappointment. If you know you’re the type to sleep in and wake up ten minutes before you leave for class, don’t tell yourself to wake up at 5 to workout and go grocery shopping. You’ll never do it, you’ll feel bad, and it will reinforce the habit of ignoring your plans and going against your own decisions. Start really small so you don’t let yourself down. For example if you always wait until the night before the test, tell yourself you’ll also study for at least one hour the day before that too. Then all you have to do is spend 15 minutes reading 4 times throughout the day- much easier than saying you’re going to start studying the week before for three hours a day - it’s just not realistic. Once you prove you can study a little bit the day before, maybe next test you can say an hour the three days before the test, but whatever it is it should be incremental, no one can jump from zero to 100 and maintain long term. Also, start finding tricks to help. For example, I hate washing my face at night, so I’ll let the hot water heat up while I’m brushing my teeth so the water is ready for my face as soon as I’m done. Then it feels silly turning off the hot water instead of taking the extra minute to wash my face. Sometimes I still turn it off and don’t, but most of the time I do it. If I don’t turn the hot water before I brush my teeth, I definitely don’t do it. For the most part it works. What I used to do was tell myself I had to brush my teeth and wash my face together, but that used to result in me not brushing my teeth more often than actually washing my face. But for some people, linking things together like that works right off the bat. You just have to find what works for you, but the two keys are believing you have the powers to do what you want and not overwhelming yourself with unrealistic expectations. ;1;0.0045662100456621;[[0.98368764]];[[0.65486572]];-0.5887;0.11599999999999999;0.764;0.12;0.4215;0.053;0.9;0.047;-0.009999999999999988;0.05333702473237358;-0.01332465277777778;0.06666167751015137

Thanks for your time.";219;"My game changer was getting to the same place where you're at now, where you realize you're wasting your potential in video games (my time waster was the same as yours). 

First thing you should do is cut off all your distractions. That will leave you with a sense of emptiness and unfullfilment, which is a good thing, because you will naturally start to seek for things to fill those free time gaps. And that's the time to start doing the things you have to do, and start building discipline slowly and progressively. 

It is important not to be too harsh on yourself, you won't get disciplined in a day. Be patient, slowly but surely. Before you realize, you will be much more intrigued by the things you have to study, and that will make you feel really good.

Also, search for new ways of distraction when you need it. You already know games makes you waste your ~~time~~ life, so try something different. Try going for a walks, running a bit, cycling, gym, chess, reading, whatever you like, just avoid the things you know won't get you any benefit.

But, remember, slowly but surely.

Thanks for your time.";219;3 years ago I was in a similar place. I weighed 310lbs, had dropped out of school, didn't have a job and was extremely depressed. Now, I'm back in school, have a job I love and lost 90lbs. The first step for me was going to therapy. If you are depressed then you should talk to someone. It also is a great way for you to learn about yourself with the help of a professional. If you're in school then there should be someone there you can talk to for free. And even if you don't get anything out of the actual appointment, you will still feel like you accomplished something by sticking to that routine. Also, have a word with someone about getting checked for ADHD. I was undiagnosed and after getting medication I was able to be much more productive.

23 yo male here. There's a plethora of great advice here and all over the internet on how to get disciplined and start building good habits but like most people visiting this subreddit, I still can't do it. I know I should study, exercise, meditate and have a good sleep schedule but I forgo that for the instant gratification of masturbation and video games. At times theres been periods where ive been slightly disciplined but I always fall back into bad habits eventually. And over time, constantly failing at becoming disciplined has discouraged me more and more over time to the point where I get quite depressed at my wasted potential. I am quite fortunate that I somehow got into med school straight from high school but I'm barely scraping through basically never studying (I've failed some subjects as well). I have no high goals in medicine because I know I'm lazy and ive failed so many times to get disciplined. I'm now worried for my future patients because they would have an incompetent doctor taking care of them but not worried enough to do something about it.

I used to be reasonably athletic and lift weights but I am again in a period of being lazy and having no discipline whatsoever.

I assume most of you guys that have become disciplined tried and failed a few times before eventually getting it all right. What turned it around for you guys?

I know the things I should be doing but the voice that's telling me I can't and that I won't amount to anything is growing louder as the years go by that I'm lazy and undisciplined.

When i realised i was tired of beeing average because all I did was play video games &amp; spend time on the internet instead of studying for school and improving myself in general. The thought stucked on my head and ressonated there I knew I had to change somehow thats where the second game changer comes in: having a goal I wanted to become fitter so that motivated me to start hitting the gym and excercissing . All in all : become self aware &amp; tired of your old self to change towards the better version of yourself who you can be proud of.

So instead I fall into weaker habits that sap my time, life, and self esteem. It sucks really bad. I end up getting depressed and the cycle repeats, one notch lower to hell every fucking time.

I've posted on here before hoping someone can help me out lol. Maybe no one loves me. I don't love myself and that seems to be half the problem. The trouble is, I don't know how to fix myself. So instead I cry in my room, call up a friend who never answers, get drunk, repeat. Cheers! :p

You should take it step by step and just go with the flow for a while.

I personally had the same problems as you (video games and porn) and I was also overweight. After countles tries I started going to the gym regularly, with the help of my friends that motivated me by going with me for the first couple of months. After a few months or even weeks, I started changing a lot more in my life and after a while I was this ""disciplined"" guy you are trying to be. This was a couple of years back and I built the body and personality I desired, but still struggle with a lot of other things. Getting disciplined is not one big step or a universal thing. I was disciplined when it came to exercising and eating, but I still struggle to be disciplined when it comes to studying and working.

Thanks for your time.";219;"The best way to go about this is to win the small battles. Change one small habit at a time. Reward yourself when you perform your habit. Your good habits won't just form, but they'll replace the bad habits. Every positive change you make, don't just treat it as something separate to you that you're trying to get into. Instead, try and approach it by consciously deciding to make this positive change your ""way of life"". When you see something as a way of life, you feel compelled to follow through with it consistently because you identify with the action. This worked for me when I tried to incorporate Calisthenics into my life. Now I do it every other day without thinking about it, and I actually look forward to it. Forming good habits will have a domino effect. Break it up into bitesize pieces and tackle things that you can handle at this moment. It gets easier from there. I think another important factor is to change your environment, something less distracting and dopamine boosting. Sometimes it can even be the company you keep, perhaps stop hanging out with lazy people. That's what I did.

Side note, it was a slow progression to start doing all those every day. Main priority was to work as much as I can at my barista job, while getting great grades.

* Subreddits like /r/loseit, /r/fitness, /r/eatcheapandhealthy, etc. Look on their sidebars for even more subreddits that might appeal to you.
* Get out books from the library.  Start with simple, science based books that talk about nutrition, fitness, motivation, etc etc.  Read and read some more. Google book recommendations for health and fitness. Scour the interwebs.
* Make a plan with simple, small baby steps.  Make it concrete and easily doable.  Maybe pick two simple things and do each for a month (like swapping soda for water and walking 20 minutes after supper) and then add on with 1 or 2 more for the next month.

The more you read, digest, and apply the better your success will be.  Immerse yourself in health and fitness and the discipline will come.

";1;"So, there's the standard advice: cut all caloric beverages, take every opportunity you can to increase the level of physical activity required of yourself (for instance, park at the back of parking lots), make sure vegetables take up most of the room on your plate...

For me, though, what's really helped has been two things:

1) Making peace with feeling hungry. There's not really a way around it. Losing weight involves feeling uncomfortable. You can fill your belly with high-fiber calorie-light food, but that won't feel the same as being full. And you'll soon be hungry again. You just have to be okay with it. I tell myself it's the feeling of weight loss, and that sort of helps.

2) Shifting to frozen food. This is kind of a weird one. It's hard to keep fresh, healthy food stocked with a busy schedule. For this reason, refrigerators tend to collect meats, cheeses, and starches while fresh, labor-intensive vegetables rot in their hidden drawers. The freezer, on the other hand, is the land of frozen vegetable blends, frozen chicken breasts, frozen fish, and frozen peas. So a thing that has helped me has been deciding to make my freezer the mental focal point of my refrigerator. I shop in the frozen section first, and I stock up. When I'm hungry, I remind myself to check the freezer first. I heat up a skillet of frozen edemame instead of dealing with the fridge and the inevitable thought ""a salad sure is a lot of work to make... "" while looking at meat and cheese.

I've been fairly successful with these two changes. ";1;1.0;[[0.95619092]];[[0.60156195]];0.2964;0.114;0.764;0.122;0.9745;0.132;0.825;0.042;-0.098;0.21666666666666667;0.11913580246913577;0.09753086419753088

There's so much I'd like to do/learn (drawing, jazz improvisation, calligraphy, running and working out). However, Laziness is a major inhibitor to my success.;2;Maybe a change of scenery would be good? You might be more productive if you work outside of the house. Some sort of accountability could also help.;1;0.5;[[0.92310694]];[[0.60234326]];0.8819;0.205;0.767;0.027999999999999997;0.6808;0.18899999999999997;0.8109999999999999;0.0;-0.012000000000000009;0.2125;0.4;-0.1875
[NeedAdvice] Recovering From Depression;t3_82sl4f;2;"Hi, I'm 22. I went to college to become a lawyer but fell into a deep depression (suicidal thoughts... the whole package) during my Junior year that collapsed my GPA as well as my ability to function. I left school and moved in with my parents where I have been taking classes for an engineering degree. My father is an engineer and he REALLY wants me to pursue his path in life. I failed the first semester in ComCollege when I came home. I've made C's in classes since. Seems my university days are riding me off a cliff.

Everything I do now is less effective since my depressive episode. I have to try twice as hard to accomplish a tenth of what I used to in school. My work life is unaffected though. I have been working part-time at a local Publix while i take classes and the manager has offered me to come on full time. I've seen a lot of people move through the ranks in this store and I don't mind the work. In fact, it's the only thing I do all day that gives me a fulfilled feeling. It's simple work... but I feel proud of making the gears of the company turn. School hasn't given me that feeling in years. I'm a clever guy so I think I could make it to management within the company sooner or later. My boss tells me hopeful stories about guys my age making it there all the time. 

Then... there is my complacency. My parents want me to stick it through college. I just want to move on from this chapter in my life. It's killing me. Folks in my graduating class have been working for over a year now and I'm just sitting around. Is this my chance to be a self-made man? Or am I just giving up on school and my future? 


";5;"I love engineers, so I'm kinda with your parents BUT I also get why you'd want to do something more simple.

Now... am going to tell you a harsh truth - the base reason for why you're having such a hard time learning is that your brain is too full.  Stay calm.  Hear me out.  I know it's tough.  What you're feeling right now is existential dread.  Switch your attention to your breathing, it's kinda unstable.  Smoothen it out, make it deep long slow until you feel calm.

You calm?  See that imaginary sofa over there.  Let's go over there and plop ourselves down, because this may-will take a while.

Now, most experts don't even want to think about this... but most good habits involve ""emptying the brain"".  Meditation, for example, is the number ONE brain emptying technique.  In particular, it slowly gets rid of fear-anger ""tags"" from our brains.

Your brain, as it is right now, is not just full of important facts and stuff to remember - it's also crowded (too crowded) with fear-anger ""tags"", and boy... they are sticky motherfuckers for a survival reason.

Depression means that you were triggering your fear-anger flight-fight system with old bad memories (too much).  And so... over time, you filled up limited brain attic with like duplicate files of bad memories and which are also extra heavy because of the fear-anger tags.

And sticky - they are sticky very because we are designed by evolution to remember who our enemies are, which is what our flight-fight system is for.

My God, yes - that's how easy it is to fuck up our brain-computers but BUT good news - it can be fixed with very simple method.  Just keeping calm when you recall bad memories will slowly train the brain to remove the fear-anger tags.

Now for more bad news (again), meditation takes time and will also require some brain slack to make the required ""pay attention to your breathing"" circuitry.

For me, it took 7 months before I declared myself a meditation fan.  Most, of course, prefer quicker methods.

And, GOOD NEWS!  There are quicker methods BUT bad news - we gotta deal with PRIDE - extra sticky neural wiring because fear-anger flight-fight tends to be involved with stuff we're proud about.

Oh shit - this is hard.  I've got (for me) very quick fixes but I'm also a meditation mid-ranker, read at least 6 brain books and I have been killing pride for months.  What is easy to me is of course going to feel like impossible to others.

But I'm a stubborn, very stubborn fuck.  I've got a lot of pride - neural circuitry - invested in ""there's gotta be an easier way to do this shit"".

OK, let's try THIS - let's get rid of any resentful feelings you've got to your parents.  Let's fucking get rid of THAT first.

Your parents, our families - they want to protect us.  Whatever they do, even if you are convinced they are wrong or interfering or trying to run your life - they do so out of love and a really really strong need to fucking protect you.  OK?

Dwell on that.  Reflect on that.  Let's try to get rid of some very sticky neural wiring with a blast of very sappy love.  Your parents are there for you, they are supporting you even if they don't agree with you.

You've already got the strongest asset on your side.  People who care about you and want to help you.";10;2.0;[[0.94782971]];[[0.54720932]];0.9374;0.124;0.807;0.069;0.9883;0.185;0.6859999999999999;0.129;-0.0010000000000000009;0.08657407407407408;0.060436507936507976;0.026137566137566112

";5;"complete your school - you are very lucky to get in to school.

school is easier than the easiest job out there.

so complete it. 

on the side - do the stuff that you want like working , business etc.

you have invested time, money in school.

few more years at it will give you education - which is definitely an asset in todays society.

ideally - you should have created a business before finishing school.
but you have not made a business so far - so complete school and on the side work on your business.

let me know your thoughts on why my answer is wrong.

this is a time to evolve .

your brain will have many thoughts - let them pass and keep the toil on.
your toil will give you peace that is earned by you.

relax.

pray 4 times a day - morning , noon , evening , night.

prayer steps:

ask for forgiveness from your sins so far.

ask for your desires to come true

say thanks for everything you have.

pray for your loved ones.

pray for humanity.

Today: Struggling to get school assignments done due to procrastination. Spending barely any time programming because I'm so fucking indecisive on what to do. Can no longer stick to any schedule. Spent fucking 6 hours browsing Reddit yesterday. Spent fucking 4 extra hours in bed today.  

What the fuck even happened to me lol. This sucks so much. I just want to be where I was a few months ago. I don't understand how I regressed so hard. fuckingdamnitlol

I just used that as a big lesson in learning to value my time and the opportunities I now have in life.

It's like I'm playing catchup because I ""lost"" those ten thousand hours or more on gaming.

But the truth is you actually learned and gained some invaluable skills and a certain mindset that can help you in the future if you allow it.

So instead of feeling like a piece of shit, why not stop wasting even more time and get on with it.

Things aren't always going to go well, it isn't just a straight line up to your ""perfect"" life. 

Life ebbs and flows and it goes up and down. Sometimes you will regress, sometimes when you take one step back, you'll shortly felel like you've taken 3 steps back.

But the only thing that really matters is that you reflect on what happened and then keep walking forward in the direction you want to go. 

There's no point looking back to feel sorry for yourself, look back to see what you want to take from the past that will be of benefit and value to you and apply that in your life moving forward to improve yourself.

"[NeedAdvice] My current friends secretly dislike me and are trying to kick me out from their ""clique"" because i don't get along with their friend from secondary school/10th grade and i'm alone.";t3_84u1ue;8;"This will be a dramatic and a long story. But an exact explanation of my current situation.

When i join tertiary education in 2017, i met my ""friends"" and i thought this was my best day of my life because i got what i thought an ideal friend would be like. Our clique is small. I didn't get along with a person B(for confidentiality sake) which is person A's friend since highschool/ secondary school. 

I don't know which words in the english dictionary can explain person B's personality but i'll give an example of what he does and you guys can judge.

Whenever i ask my lecturer questions, he would interrupt and ""angrily"" shout at me saying ""You never listened in class? Thats so easy."" My ""clique"" quietly watched. Person B is also the type of person that will never listen to your argument and is a huge hypocrite. 

So for example, we can be arguing about which graphics card is better. 1080TI vs 680TI. And if he thinks 680TI is better, he will not listen to what you have to say and when i gave an analogy like ""1080TI is like a bugatti veyron and 680TI would be like a Mercedes C63 AMG."" he would reply with ""No, you can't compare cars with graphics cards. They are different. You don't know jackshit."" Which is why i don't get a long with person B. And the rest of the clique doesn't do anything. There is too much bad qualities about him then i care to write so i'll just move on. 

This person B, somehow really dislike me and started to gossip to the clique members secretly and i found out. Which made me dislike person B even more. There are times person B do stupid shit to piss me off. Like kicking the door and the door would rebound to me. He basically did a lot of stuff to trigger me all of which are obvious. And my ""friends"" never said anything despite me asking them whether if it's right to do such a thing.

Fast forward, i seek help from my bestfriend who is currently studying law and is at a different school. He told me to tell them that they're pussies. So i did, and it triggered my ""friends"" so much that they went to person B and person B confronted me in canteen. Everyone is against me. So i thought, maybe its really my fault. 

During the end of the year exam, my ""clique"" sat near me but never talked to me. They shared advices and tips to get good grades and i overheard them. They got even salty that i got a perfect GPA where as they get the average GPA. 

Fast forward to 2018, we are having internship and we do shift work. Person A called me to cover for him. I agreed. Which i discover, he went to party and invite everyone of our clique but me. And person A later admit it to me and told me what has been said behind me (Not surprised as i've been through a lot to be able to read a person's mind just by facial expression).

We had to do project for our internship. And i did 100% of the work. I told person A to write the script he didn't. He said he wants to ""help""me. Which he never did. So i asked him to take a picture for me because it's my off day. He ""forgot"" to take picture of it. Which pissed me off. 

And he said that he will ""help"" me to go back to the days where everyone is happy. But the method he did only annoys me even further. During my off days, he message me every single day and did stupid 1 sentence conversation and whenever i reply and made effort to write like 2-3 sentences, he just gives me the ""oh hahaha"" every single day. So i gave up and replied very late and did the same to him. 

We came back to school recently for briefing. The clique basically outcasted me. At that point, I don't care anymore. But what makes it difficult is that, person B and another clique member sits next to me. I'm in between. And during group work, i always have to partner with person C(the other clique member) which i don't care as long as we get the job done and i think he thinks the same as well. 

Other than them, i don't have friends. I screwed up during my first year and i was known for being serious, unapproachable and fierce. And now, everyone kinda avoids me and it's even more difficult when i'm an introvert and have social anxiety. What should i do?";126;"make new friends.

"[NeedAdvice] My current friends secretly dislike me and are trying to kick me out from their ""clique"" because i don't get along with their friend from secondary school/10th grade and i'm alone.";t3_84u1ue;8;"This will be a dramatic and a long story. But an exact explanation of my current situation.

When i join tertiary education in 2017, i met my ""friends"" and i thought this was my best day of my life because i got what i thought an ideal friend would be like. Our clique is small. I didn't get along with a person B(for confidentiality sake) which is person A's friend since highschool/ secondary school. 

I don't know which words in the english dictionary can explain person B's personality but i'll give an example of what he does and you guys can judge.

Whenever i ask my lecturer questions, he would interrupt and ""angrily"" shout at me saying ""You never listened in class? Thats so easy."" My ""clique"" quietly watched. Person B is also the type of person that will never listen to your argument and is a huge hypocrite. 

So for example, we can be arguing about which graphics card is better. 1080TI vs 680TI. And if he thinks 680TI is better, he will not listen to what you have to say and when i gave an analogy like ""1080TI is like a bugatti veyron and 680TI would be like a Mercedes C63 AMG."" he would reply with ""No, you can't compare cars with graphics cards. They are different. You don't know jackshit."" Which is why i don't get a long with person B. And the rest of the clique doesn't do anything. There is too much bad qualities about him then i care to write so i'll just move on. 

This person B, somehow really dislike me and started to gossip to the clique members secretly and i found out. Which made me dislike person B even more. There are times person B do stupid shit to piss me off. Like kicking the door and the door would rebound to me. He basically did a lot of stuff to trigger me all of which are obvious. And my ""friends"" never said anything despite me asking them whether if it's right to do such a thing.

Fast forward, i seek help from my bestfriend who is currently studying law and is at a different school. He told me to tell them that they're pussies. So i did, and it triggered my ""friends"" so much that they went to person B and person B confronted me in canteen. Everyone is against me. So i thought, maybe its really my fault. 

During the end of the year exam, my ""clique"" sat near me but never talked to me. They shared advices and tips to get good grades and i overheard them. They got even salty that i got a perfect GPA where as they get the average GPA. 

Fast forward to 2018, we are having internship and we do shift work. Person A called me to cover for him. I agreed. Which i discover, he went to party and invite everyone of our clique but me. And person A later admit it to me and told me what has been said behind me (Not surprised as i've been through a lot to be able to read a person's mind just by facial expression).

We had to do project for our internship. And i did 100% of the work. I told person A to write the script he didn't. He said he wants to ""help""me. Which he never did. So i asked him to take a picture for me because it's my off day. He ""forgot"" to take picture of it. Which pissed me off. 

And he said that he will ""help"" me to go back to the days where everyone is happy. But the method he did only annoys me even further. During my off days, he message me every single day and did stupid 1 sentence conversation and whenever i reply and made effort to write like 2-3 sentences, he just gives me the ""oh hahaha"" every single day. So i gave up and replied very late and did the same to him. 

We came back to school recently for briefing. The clique basically outcasted me. At that point, I don't care anymore. But what makes it difficult is that, person B and another clique member sits next to me. I'm in between. And during group work, i always have to partner with person C(the other clique member) which i don't care as long as we get the job done and i think he thinks the same as well. 

Other than them, i don't have friends. I screwed up during my first year and i was known for being serious, unapproachable and fierce.

What should i do?";126;"I know I'm a minority on this one, and I know I never listened to anyone when they said this when i was younger, but your friends in highschool are not usually going to be your friends for life.  They won't even be your friends by the end of highschool.  

90% of my social group from highschool stopped hanging out when we started having sex.  1) We were too busy. 2) most of the group started fighting over who was screwing who.

I'm not saying you should just never have friends, but I'm trying to say, you're going to be a lot happier when you let go of just about everyone else.  Letting people in shouldn't be a necessity, but the exception.  You can be warm and friendly, without internalizing their opinions and behavior.  It's like that Ron Swanson quote, ""I once worked with a man for 3 years and never learned his name...best friend I ever had.""  

The older I get, the less I care about approval, but the more I realize that all I want from friends are people I can tolerate enough to do the rare group activities with, or to get very specific solicited opinions.  The rest of the time, I'd rather be alone, unless I'm in a relationship.  I'm less inclined toward those too, because that's when I really start to care about more than tolerability.  

Be friendly, be considerate, be respectful, but at the end of the day be your own person.  No one else defines you.  Don't let them get to you.  Don't engage in drama.  It's not worth it.

Decide who you want to be, stick to it, and you'll find better people along the way.

TL;DR:  Seems like too much drama.  Let it go, focus on you, and everything else will fall into place.";17;0.1349206349206349;[[0.97856987]];[[0.63310844]];0.9539;0.113;0.802;0.085;0.9958;0.209;0.74;0.051;-0.13;0.04312087912087916;0.23143939393939394;-0.1883185148185148

From what I understand from your post is that your friends are friends for their own personal gain and would leave you at any given time if you don't benefit them. 

It would be better if you leave them too, and make new friends who are more loyal than them, it might be hard at first, and more so if you are an introvert but it's not impossible.

Seems like the only option is figuring out a method to get up early regardless of whether I slept well or not. Tips on this?;137;"Read Miracle Morning by Hal Elrod. He gives some really good tips about how to do just this. 

Some tips include; setting your intention to wake up early before laying down; the last thought you have before bed is often the first one you have when waking up, so if you lay down thinking that you're going to wake up tired, then you probably will. Even if it's late, lay down with the intention that you'll wake up well-rested

as soon as waking up, IMMEDIATELY brush your teeth. this forces you to get out of bed and move around a bit. 
-have a glass of water, as you'll likely wake up dehydrated and it's easy to mistake that for being sleepy. 

I have struggled with this regularly, but the things that help the most are getting out of bed right away and not trusting yourself to even snooze once.

also if you like to work out in the mornings, leave your workout clothes next to your bed and change into them right away after getting up. 

simple actions like these can trigger the brain into 'going with the flow' even if you don't have the willpower at that moment";59;0.43065693430656937;[[0.94973578]];[[0.63193105]];0.5574;0.078;0.894;0.027999999999999997;0.8385;0.078;0.877;0.045;0.017;-0.0763888888888889;0.08165266106442577;-0.15804154995331465

Tips on this?;137;"Get a high wattage fluorescent bulb that is one of those horribly sharp blue kinds: https://goo.gl/nR9niU

Before you go to sleep replace the bulb in a lamp or overhead light (keep it off) in a place where you can get to immediately in the morning.

Upon hearing your alarm, go to your place, flip on the light, do as many pushups or body squats as you can while your alarm is still sounding, don't even touch your alarm until you've completed your exercise.

The blue light will actually reset your internal clock to wake you up roughly at the time you expose yourself to it in the morning. The pushups will raise your body temperature which is usually the part of being sleepy that breaks resolve most easily in the morning.

To really cement your adherence, take a couple minutes to rehearse the routine (without actually flipping on the light) before going to sleep. This means setting your alarm to a minute in the future, getting in bed and pretending to sleep, letting it go off, and going through an approximation of the above process (really though, don't expose yourself to that light). Doing more than 2 repetitions will almost guarantee that it will be easy the next day.

This scheme has really helped me, and has made getting up at ~5am each morning easy. You will actually be tired fairly early in the evening which lets you know your circadian rhythm is getting properly set by the bright light in the morning.

I love reading the stuff posted in here. I'd like to write about my situation in the hope that a lot of people will relate and that some of you will have practical advice.

I've felt lost for a long period of time. The intensity of that feeling is sporadic, and sometimes it can get me quite down in the dumps, but most of the time it's a form of 'background noise'.

I struggle with negative emotions like regret, guilt and self-doubt. I also find that I'm very prone to typical behaviours that stimulate depressive episodes: comparing myself to others, negative self-talk, impatience and poor social media management.

I'm in my mid-twenties, I don't have it bad at all. I've graduated from university (media/culture/sociology), I've worked up some savings and I'm in a great relationship. I still live at home (rent-free), job opportunities in my town are very poor, I work in a service industry/hospitality job as a bartender/waiter/table-turner - I do not enjoy the work, but I actively try to be grateful to be earning a wage.

In 6-8 months I'll be moving to a city with my partner. They will be studying for a year to further their ambitions. I, however, don't have a clear picture of what I want to do or what I'd like to try. This is a common issue that I know a lot of people suffer from.

I have two options available to me: I can study further myself (postgraduate/masters) or I can look for work. My current plan of attack is to apply for further study, this way I can withdraw the application if an opportunity arises towards the end of the year.

I love reading the stuff posted in here. I'd like to write about my situation in the hope that a lot of people will relate and that some of you will have practical advice.

I've felt lost for a long period of time. The intensity of that feeling is sporadic, and sometimes it can get me quite down in the dumps, but most of the time it's a form of 'background noise'.

I struggle with negative emotions like regret, guilt and self-doubt. I also find that I'm very prone to typical behaviours that stimulate depressive episodes: comparing myself to others, negative self-talk, impatience and poor social media management.

I'm in my mid-twenties, I don't have it bad at all. I've graduated from university (media/culture/sociology), I've worked up some savings and I'm in a great relationship. I still live at home (rent-free), job opportunities in my town are very poor, I work in a service industry/hospitality job as a bartender/waiter/table-turner - I do not enjoy the work, but I actively try to be grateful to be earning a wage.

In 6-8 months I'll be moving to a city with my partner. They will be studying for a year to further their ambitions. I, however, don't have a clear picture of what I want to do or what I'd like to try. This is a common issue that I know a lot of people suffer from.

I have two options available to me: I can study further myself (postgraduate/masters) or I can look for work. My current plan of attack is to apply for further study, this way I can withdraw the application if an opportunity arises towards the end of the year. In 5 months I'll start looking for work in that city.

^ I'd say the above text is a brief overview of my situation ^

What can I do in the next 6-8 months that will help me move forward in a positive and productive manner. What behaviours and habits can I start to be mindful of? What will help me develop a more clear picture, reduce negative emotion and achieve more goals. Heck, what goals could I start setting for myself in relation to my situation?

Tips on ANY aspect of life are desired here - finances, creativity, learning, fitness - bla, bla, bla - anything.

FINALLY, what experiences and breakthroughs have you had in relation to developing yourself within a frustrating period of time?

TL;DR - I have 6 - 8 months to better myself in all aspects of life. What should I keep in mind, where should I start and how can I use this time to help build a better picture of what I want to do with myself?";6;"I´d say get a decent degree. You spent huge money for your degree and now you are working as a bartender? C´mon.
Of course you should do whatever suits you best but I guess the job perspectives in the US with such a degree are as bad as they are in Europe. With the difference that you pay a lot of money while we at least get the degree for ""free"", so even worse.

Might wanna look in getting a masters in economics/business.";1;0.16666666666666669;[[0.9568852]];[[0.53315035]];0.6112;0.147;0.723;0.129;-0.8256;0.049;0.826;0.125;0.094;0.030611832611832618;0.05185185185185188;-0.02124001924001926
[NeedAdvice] Lacking the Energy to Complete School Work;t3_82jfvn;3;"Hello Everyone,

I am a high school/college student who is currently in need of some discipline advice. 

Although I have a strong academic performance, I have an issue with struggling to complete work outside of school. I find that after leaving school and arriving back home (I start my day at 5:00AM and arrive home at 3:00PM), I lack the energy and the will to go fourth and complete my homework. Usually, I find myself having the strong desire to lay down, relax, and take a nap. Now before you instantaneously blame a lack of proper sleep for such an issue, I find that when I am functioning off of eight or more hours of sleep this problem seems to still occur. Although this issue normally does not drastically effect my academic performance, I occasionally get put in a position where such an issue becomes extremely problematic and has negative consequences; an example being that of my current situation, where I have a poorly written, and unfinished paper due tomorrow and I have a midterm exam tomorrow on topics I have yet to sit down and actually study. Even though I know the consequences for not doing work on either task are going to be bad, my lack of energy is causing me to accept whatever consequences I may receive from doing so. I have no desire to do either task, and I worry that this habit (or whatever you may call it) will ultimately bring me down in future operations. I am not sure if the cause of the issue is just a lack of motivation or what, but regardless I am in need of some advice on how to fix such an issue. Anything helps.";2;"How is your nutrition? Dehydration can also make you tired and fatigued. 

Why do you need to go home? Go straight to the library and study. Your brain must be getting ready to sleep every time you come home, because it's been a habit.

Exercise is important, Vitamin D, and electrolytes. It's basic stuff, but is easily overlooked nowadays with busy schedules and easy access to fast food.

Try setting an alarm for 30 minutes and go nap then wake up after, you'll likely feel a little more fresh and have the energy to start your homework.

You can pretty much pretend like it's a new day if that helps.

5AM to 3PM is pretty hectic, and most people seem to have a natural 2-4PM lull so don't be afraid of allowing yourself to nap and recharge.

Taking care of the other essentials will also help of course i.e. exercising regularly, eating well, sleeping right.

Another thing you can do is to literally sit there, close your eyes, and feel the feelings, emotions, and sensations of the ""not wanting to"". Just observe it as best you can without doing anything, leave the judgment or thinking behind. Or if they do run rampant, do your best to just observe them rather then get caught up in them.

Let them come, let them be, and let them go.

Another thing you can do is to clearly specify what you actually need to do for the schoolwork. Be very clear and specific, not vague.

Don't say ""need to do 30 minutes study on chemistry"" or whatever, specify clearly what worksheets, topics, or chapters you will cover, for how long etc.

Then just start on the first one and focusing only on that until you finish then move on to the next


The other thing is to just say fck it, I'm doing this regardless of how I feel. Set a timer, for 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes and then just knuckle down until the timer runs up then take a break and get back to it after.

if you set a timer for 10 minutes and just do the damn thing, you will face some resistance but almost at the 10 minute mark you will liekly realize it isn't all that bad and the thing that was really stopping you from doing it at all was just yourself.

You painted this big bad picture of how dreadful the task would be when in reality it was nothing close to that.

It's always our minds playing tricks on us, we just need to learn when the tricks it plays is actually valuable to us or simply detrimental, and act accordingly based off that";1;0.5;[[0.96833448]];[[0.60320417]];-0.1697;0.066;0.8370000000000001;0.09699999999999999;0.9525;0.099;0.863;0.038;-0.092;-0.12847222222222224;-0.0043719806763284665;-0.12410024154589375

This is a recent development, and whenever I attempt to do schoolwork, I tend to get this feeling of ""not wanting to"", its hard to describe and its hard to get over. I have a hard time imagining myself doing the task and I would rather do anything else.

It occurs especially with assignments and due dates. I have a hard time doing something, just because I needed to do it. Here I am making this post instead of working on something.

I usually time myself and kind of make it a game. I'll set a timer for 10-25 minutes (nothing longer than 25 for me), and just say ""Ok that's how long I'm going to work on X"".

- also I wish there was a different listing or some way to organize activities you’ve already have completed and for new activities. I’d imagine that once you’ve completed many activities it’ll be a pain to scroll all the way down to the newer ones.

And reflect on what could go right. We tend to act into what you imagine will happen. You imagine your day being stressful, there's some part of you that will act into it being stressful. You imagine your day being easy and chill, things will occur that way to you, and you're more inclined to feel that way. Morning meditation and visualization of how you want your day to go can help with this.

It's good that you notice mindlessly scrolling through your phone puts you in a funk -- noticing is a great first step to change. Stop doing it. Something that helped me when I was in a similar place to you (constantly anxious), I started limiting social media/app time to the end of the day. At 8pm, I'd allow myself to do whatever I wanted online. But by that time, I had already gone so long without the distractions that I was less interested in spending time engaging them at all. Typically I'd catch up on notifications and be bored within 15-20 minutes. I'd also feel accomplished when I actually made it to 8pm, which encouraged me to keep going, and helped me gain confidence in myself that eased my anxiety. 

Also, don't judge yourself if you fuck up, just try again the next day.

Thanks in advance!";5;"You don't achieve to be happy, you want to happily achieve.

It's important to realize that ALWAYS working isn't actually as productive or helpful in achieving your goals - especially over the long run.

You can't keep redlining a car and not expect it's engine to burn out.

You can't keep exercising and expect your body not to get tired.

And just like you can't keep working expecting that you don't need any rest.

In regards to getting super stressed when things don't go according to plan, rarely do things ever go to plan! That is life, it is always in a state of flux and change.

What you need to understand is what is the purpose of planning?

You plan to make the best use of your time based on what you know at the time you make your plans.

But when it comes closer to actualizing that plan, things change! There will be new information, different circumstances, or entirely different goals.

So you have to remain flexible and adaptable to this.

Remember, you make a plan so that you can make the **best** use of your time.

When you stress out because things aren't going according to plan, is that making the best use of your time?

Nope.

So what should you do instead?

Ask yourself at that point in time, what is the best thing you can be doing with the time you have available with your current energy levels, mental state of mind, and the context you find yourself in (e.g. if you're at the office, or at home, or whatever)? 

Doing this actually helps you achieve and be more EFFECTIVE at what you set out to do. 

The game isn't to make reality fit to your plans (although this would be ideal), it is to simply do the best with what you have to further yourself towards your goals and outcomes. 

You can also schedule time to relax at the end of the day or at set periods throughout the day. You'll find this feels a little weird at first but keep at it and you'll come to realize how valuable that time can be because it really does allow you to take your foot off the pedal and appreciate all the hard work you do, rejuvenate, rest, and refresh yourself for when you get back to productive mode next.

You'll also notice when you do start working again you'll come back with even more energy and vigor to go harder.

This won't necessarily be easy but it'll be worth it. You'll know where the sweet spot lies now because you've reached both extremes.

Also, understand we have different values and priorities in life and you need to figure out where yours lie.

If you truly do value your friends, family, or relationships - and the truth is you don't have to value any of these things no matter what other people or society says, it is your life after all - then you would want to carve out time for them

A year ago I thought that discipline is weird, but now is my boiling point; this year, month and week VERY LOUDLY told to me that i'm piece of shit.


Okay, I read too much. And I named my account in honor of Josef Svejk - a fat, foolish, simple, but very perceptive character of Czech literature. But reading isn't all the life. I don't know English well, I'm fat, I have social anxiety, actually I don't know what to do in my life (I'm 23). I want to write and I'm writing not-bad novels, but who cares. I'm drinking too much beer and very often (so it correlates with social anxiety, that I'm ""curing"" beer lol). I'm living in Russia but want to go abroad to work and travel. And of course I'm lazy.


This is my shit. I hate myself for it. But I read reddit so much and now I want to say in my clumsy English:

**YES, I'M READY TO WORK HARD**


*What I did*:

I changed the passwords for all my socials, games and other, packed in the envelope and gave it to my mom for a year.

*In three months* :

* I'll lose around of 50 pounds (200 to 150)
* I'll write a part of novel every day
* **I'll find a job**

*In six months* :

* I'll study English to that level when I have no stupid mistakes in complex sentences like this :P
* I'll rent a room / aparts (maybe not in Russia, haha)

But ok. What to do later? Shit I writed down this but now i'm in stupor. Oh, I'm ready to work hard, but dunno what to do. It's well that I had a plan embryo. But this is not a plan.

Okay, by the way, I'm starting now. From this day at least half of a year I will not drink beer or smoke weed/tobacco. My room will be clean everyday and I'll be clean in my body, thoughts and speech. It will be hard, but I look forward to your help and support. Thank you Reddit, without you I'd never start this shit.

^^help ^^me

(Sorry maybe I chose the wrong tag)";7;"Let me start by saying all that sounds great! I just joined reddit for similar purposes: to connect with people trying to improve. I've been starting new habits and improving my lifestyle for bit over a month now.

**Smaller goals**

What you have right now are goals - and they indeed are not a plan. Goals are good to have, but they can become very destructive if you do not set yourself up to succeed. Saying you will lose 50 pounds can be good, but it will get frustrating if you won't accomplish the goal. That is why I would suggest that you take this area ""losing weight"" and start by doing things better than yesterday. Your goal will simply be to exercise a bit more than yesterday or eat a tad healthier. This will not overwhelm you, but it will stack up and in a couple of weeks you will be doing much better.

You can use different methods for this, but the point remains: you must create smaller goals that will have you feeling good about yourself during your process.

**Time is a tool**

You might want to consider tying your activities to time rather than the progress. For me writing becomes very frustrating if I think ""I must write 2 slides"", but if I instead think ""I'll sit in front of the computer and write for half an hour, even if I just end up with two sentences"", frustration is gone as I know I'll get my break after the time has passed.

I find the Pomodoro technique very useful for all productive activities. It can also help to deny yourself a chance to work on anything after 6 pm for example. You also need time for enjoyment and this will prompt you to work harder during the day, as you know you can’t procrastinate and start in the evening.

**Emergency button**

Have a plan for when you really, and I mean REALLY, don’t feel like doing any of this. For when you wake up, can’t get out of bed and just feel like there is no meaning to anything. Remember that you are not these thoughts and feelings. If you get up, take a cold shower, eat a good breakfast, go jogging – anything that suits you – you will feel better again. You are in control, you are still the same person who wanted to set up these goals and get better.

**Use your strengths**

You have strengths. You read a lot – that’s great. This means you have a much longer attention span than most. You wrote this post – you can get fired up. Remember the feeling and use it: when you exercise, get fired up. Go farther than you feel like going.

Find ways to use your strengths. This will boost your self-confidence and make sure you stay motivated. You also said you stopped using your socials (as in social media)? This can be great but remember that sometimes you need to lend a bit of strength from other people too. Social media in moderation can help you stay connected and remind you that once you improve, you will also have a positive impact on everyone around you.

**Dopamine**

Be very mindful of dopamine, because it will beat your willpower *every single time*. Dopamine controls your reward and pleasure centers. This is why it's so hard to remove bad habits. It is however much easier to replace them. Right now you might get your dopamine from video games, junk food, social media or sex, and your brain will come up with a million reasons why you should keep getting it from these well-established sources. This will be by far the hardest thing you are about to do: getting rid of addictions. Do not believe whatever excuses your brain comes up with. Your brain will get used to it in time, but it will still demand dopamine from somewhere: you must find new, healthier sources. Plan it out.

Well this became a long post, I hope some of it is helpful. At the very least I helped myself out by writing all this down and articulating what I’m trying to work on!";10;1.4285714285714286;[[0.96284601]];[[0.67820031]];-0.8459;0.132;0.7190000000000001;0.149;0.9985;0.18600000000000003;0.747;0.067;-0.13599999999999998;-0.00887706855791962;0.13719444444444442;-0.14607151300236404

A year ago I thought that discipline is weird, but now is my boiling point; this year, month and week VERY LOUDLY told to me that i'm piece of shit.


Okay, I read too much. And I named my account in honor of Josef Svejk - a fat, foolish, simple, but very perceptive character of Czech literature. But reading isn't all the life. I don't know English well, I'm fat, I have social anxiety, actually I don't know what to do in my life (I'm 23). I want to write and I'm writing not-bad novels, but who cares. I'm drinking too much beer and very often (so it correlates with social anxiety, that I'm ""curing"" beer lol). I'm living in Russia but want to go abroad to work and travel. And of course I'm lazy.


This is my shit. I hate myself for it. But I read reddit so much and now I want to say in my clumsy English:

**YES, I'M READY TO WORK HARD**


*What I did*:

I changed the passwords for all my socials, games and other, packed in the envelope and gave it to my mom for a year.

*In three months* :

* I'll lose around of 50 pounds (200 to 150)
* I'll write a part of novel every day
* **I'll find a job**

*In six months* :

* I'll study English to that level when I have no stupid mistakes in complex sentences like this :P

"[NeedAdvice] Trouble dealing with the ""regularness of life?""";t3_87wgta;6;"This is something that I've been dealing with for probably a few years now--after graduating college, around starting first job--but I've been more conscious of especially in the last few months. Overall, it feels like a cycle of consistency that affects all of my responsibilities. When I feel like I'm doing well, I'm consistent about making food, cleaning up/doing errands, getting enough sleep, getting to work on time, and doing well at work. Gradually, though, I feel like I start neglecting those responsibilities in that order until I feel overwhelmed enough to get everything back in place. That's where I am now, for the most part--I've ordered food at least once a day almost every day for the last two days, have a disgusting kitchen, and I called out of work yesterday and today because of lack of sleep/difficulty getting out of bed in time. My days at work preceding these two days off, I've been slowly coming in later and later and have not been very proactive at work, procrastinating on projects and just playing on my phone instead. 

I've noticed that this usually happens in cycles though, where I'll been on top of everything for a few weeks and then, without realizing it, I'll have had a gross kitchen for a few weeks and have gotten five hours or less of sleep a night. In the first part of the cycle, I'm generally in a better mood and optimistic about my job and everything. In the latter part, I feel boxed in and paranoid about my job and will usually weigh my options re: finding another position that would work better for me.

I started rewatching the Sopranos the other day, and one line between two characters discussing depression and therapy stood out to me: ""It's like just the fucking regularness of life is too fucking hard for me, or something."" The line reminded me that I'm having trouble with relatively simple issues, things that should be the foundation of a healthy lifestyle. I think the getting enough sleep is the most important part of the problem though, as not having enough will lead to difficulty at work and, subsequently, a worse mood about everything. I have been regularly lifting for about three months now, which has helped give me a consistent and concrete goal. I'm still disappointed that I'm having trouble getting control of everything else, though.

I feel like the answer should be easy enough--get disciplined and prioritize what's important and will led to success. Make time to regularly cook and clean, always go to sleep at a responsible time, and get out of bed and leave in time to get to work when I should. I've found time to go to the gym after work, so there's no reason I can't make time for the others.

Were you taught how to do them, and asked to participate in household maintenance in age appropriate ways? 

I only ask because I realized the answer to the latter question for me was ""no"" and I'm going through a process of essentially parenting myself in a way. I'm in my 30's and realized that taking care of myself consistently is a challenge because I was never really taught how. I have major ebbs and flows, but it's been getting a lot better since I've focused on developing habits rather than relying on motivation alone. After awhile doing dishes and cleaning the kitchen after cooking has become a habit I don't have to think about, but I really had to develop something like a muscle memory around it with mindfulness. It's taken about 3 months of focusing and being intentional, but it's getting easier.

"[NeedAdvice] Trouble dealing with the ""regularness of life?""";t3_87wgta;6;"This is something that I've been dealing with for probably a few years now--after graduating college, around starting first job--but I've been more conscious of especially in the last few months. Overall, it feels like a cycle of consistency that affects all of my responsibilities. When I feel like I'm doing well, I'm consistent about making food, cleaning up/doing errands, getting enough sleep, getting to work on time, and doing well at work. Gradually, though, I feel like I start neglecting those responsibilities in that order until I feel overwhelmed enough to get everything back in place. That's where I am now, for the most part--I've ordered food at least once a day almost every day for the last two days, have a disgusting kitchen, and I called out of work yesterday and today because of lack of sleep/difficulty getting out of bed in time. My days at work preceding these two days off, I've been slowly coming in later and later and have not been very proactive at work, procrastinating on projects and just playing on my phone instead. 

I've noticed that this usually happens in cycles though, where I'll been on top of everything for a few weeks and then, without realizing it, I'll have had a gross kitchen for a few weeks and have gotten five hours or less of sleep a night. In the first part of the cycle, I'm generally in a better mood and optimistic about my job and everything. In the latter part, I feel boxed in and paranoid about my job and will usually weigh my options re: finding another position that would work better for me.

I started rewatching the Sopranos the other day, and one line between two characters discussing depression and therapy stood out to me: ""It's like just the fucking regularness of life is too fucking hard for me, or something."" The line reminded me that I'm having trouble with relatively simple issues, things that should be the foundation of a healthy lifestyle. I think the getting enough sleep is the most important part of the problem though, as not having enough will lead to difficulty at work and, subsequently, a worse mood about everything. I have been regularly lifting for about three months now, which has helped give me a consistent and concrete goal. I'm still disappointed that I'm having trouble getting control of everything else, though.

I feel like the answer should be easy enough--get disciplined and prioritize what's important and will led to success. Make time to regularly cook and clean, always go to sleep at a responsible time, and get out of bed and leave in time to get to work when I should. I've found time to go to the gym after work, so there's no reason I can't make time for the others.

[Need Advice] Totally Unmotivated After School;t3_7w0kie;8;Im in high school, and ever since about Midway through September, whenever I got home I would have absolutely no energy and just sleep until like 7. I get good sleep, like 9 hours most nights, I exercise and have a pretty decent diet, but nothing's changed since last September enough for me to think is causing this. Everyday it seems to be getting worse and has evolved to me not being able to get up in the mornings. I've almost been late everyday this week despite getting more than enough sleep. At this point I don't know what to do. ;14;"If you can, I'd recommend finding a club or a sport. I know you said you get exercise, but there's something about people expecting you to show up - it builds confidence. The activity doesn't even have to be something you know much about it - I'd even encourage you to try something new. Just let yourself get absorbed into whatever it is you land on. 

I've never had any kind of volleyball instruction in my life, but I just joined my college's team this semester and its been a blast. Motivation is something I've struggled with a lot throughout my academic career. I'm still struggling with it, a lot. But I'm making progress, I think. Volleyball has morning practices, which forces me to get out of bed in the mornings, but what was really special for me what that for the first time in a long time, the first thing I felt when I woke up was excitement.

Talk to your friends and family about this. It sounds like you haven't been having a great time for a while - surround yourself with good people.

You don't have to know what to do. Just do something - anything (Ok, maybe not ""anything"". I would not recommend hard drugs, joining a gang, or homicide.) Doing nothing decreases self-confidence, which further incentives you to do nothing. It's a vicious cycle.

This is a war, not a battle. You can, and deserve to, take the practical steps you need to to live a happier life. It's about consistently choosing the option that will help you grow. If nothing else, take comfort in the fact that somewhere out in the world, some internet stranger believes in you. Go fight win!

Try meditating after school is out to get a reboot. Play some relaxing music (ideally without lyrics, I enjoy the meditation station Pandora has; I down voted until it mainly played violin music which is really relaxing for me) set your phone timer for 5 minutes and focus on your breath and try to clear your mind. Add 30 seconds each day until you hit 10 or 15 minutes and keep it at that. Not only will doing this build discipline by being consistent with it, it will help build mental discipline to make the decision to be productive and keep building bits of discipline. Not to mention if you give it a chance and like it, you can start meditating before bed over your goals and reflect on your day and that's has some seriously awesome benefits if you want to keep a conscientious view of your goals and purpose in life.

This is fairly common,  so know you’re not alone. Talking to a counselor about this is so common that they uni’s usually have extra counselors for freshman students. 

You’re anxious, and it’s because you think people around you are smarter, your focus isn’t on you, it’s on the people around you. That’s causing you to stress and lose focus on what you’re supposed to do. You need to focus on yourself and what you can do and not compare yourself to others, that’s a source of misery for most people. 

There are very few people out there who don’t have to struggle to succeed, less than 1%. Everyone else—including those who you feel are smarter—are struggling.

2. You can be whoever you want to be, it’s just making a choice and acting on it.
3. Everyone is different, try many approaches until you find the right one. 

Some ideas from my life. 

If you want to wake up at 8am, plan 8hrs minimum of sleep, so make sure you’re in bed at 11:30pm to be asleep at midnight. And those 30 min between in bed and asleep don’t touch your phone or watch tv or anything with light just lay in your bed and breath: 4 seconds in, 7 seconds hold, 8 seconds out and repeat. 

Put your alarm clock on the opposite side of the room with the most annoying and loud ring tone. DO NOT SNOOZE. It is horrible for you, biochemically- just wake up!

Then put on your favorite upbeat playlist- rock, rap, whatever style just up beat!

Wash your hand with cold water this wakes up your mitochondria. Or if you shower in the mornings make the last 30-60 seconds cold water. 

You should be awake and then just remember what you want and who you want to be in life. Love yourself appreciate your life and make a decision to be proactive with your time on this planet. 

I think 🤔 😁😍 good luck!!!!!

Oh and about studying- simply don’t leave your school until you have finished studying. Don’t go home don’t go with a friend just stay in school, the library or The coffee shop and study. Remember why you’re in school, not to be better than your peers, to better yourself and find a place on this planet that is right for you. Just self reflect a bit more and limit your time on technology. Touch the earth with your bear feet and remember there’s more than shows and social media.

edit: You people are inspirational. I am very thankful for every answer";240;"Start eating healthier and exercising in some way immediately, even if it’s just going for a walk. Don’t be like “I just can’t walk. I try but I stop”. That’s bullshit. If you have working legs you can walk. Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Cut out sugar. Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants. Real food means it was alive at one point. So broccoli is real food, Cheetos are not. If you cut out sugar, do some exercise, and get enough sleep, your entire life will change. You will feel like a super hero. 

Be intentional about everything. If you make the choice to be on social media, decide ahead of time how much time you will spend. Then do that. My rule is, I’m allowed to do anything, but I can’t decide the same day. So if I decide to eat cake all day, I can do that, but I have to decide that I’ll do that tomorrow. That cuts out almost all of the temptation. 

Practice will power. This means meditation. Focus on your breath. When you get distracted, bring your attention back. That’s it. You are practicing overcoming distraction. It’s like a muscle and you can only gain control over this if you do the practice every day. Just do 10 minutes a day. Get an app like Headspace. Don’t say you can’t. You can. Doing it means you try, that’s it. Even experienced meditators spend 9 minutes distracted and finally get a minute of peace. If you can’t clear your mind that doesn’t mean you failed at meditation. All of the value in meditation is in failing and trying again. You are building the skill of not giving up.

Stop seeing yourself as incapable. You’re capable. There are 1000 things you don’t do which you aren’t tempted to do. You don’t say, “I just do cocaine. I can’t control myself” Think about why that is. It is primarily because you don’t have cocaine around you. You don’t struggle with being a serial killer either. You are basically a master when it comes to not doing cocaine and not killing people.

You can take control of your choices. You just need practice. Start where you are. If you can only mediate for 5 seconds without getting distracted, then do that, over and over, and after days or weeks you will have 6 seconds of concentration. After a few months you’ll have minutes. A year from now you’ll have hours and you will have changed your life. But you have to do the work. Start. Keep track. Always do at least the same as before, and do more when you can. You will improve over time.

Establish daily routines and be intentional about everything you do. Even if it’s something low value like binge watching TV, you can do that as long as you plan it. Soon though, when you schedule your days, you will see how little time you have and you will force yourself to spend time on things that move you toward your goal.

So the last thing is, have goals. Whatever you are passionate about. Don’t filter. Set some goal and start spending your days only doing things that move you toward that goal. Only when you establish goals will choices become clear. When you don’t have a goal, and you are faced with sleeping in or eating cake, how do you decide? I mean, if there’s no goal, then maybe you should have that cake. But when you have a goal, it’s clear that eating that cake will lower your energy and will move you away from your goal, so you don’t do it. The more clear your goal the better. If your goal is winning an Olympic gold medal, then it’s really clear that you shouldn’t eat the cake. If your goal is unclear like “help people”, it’s not as clear that you shouldn’t eat the cake.

Start building your self esteem around one statement: “I am the kind of person who only does that and believes that which moves me toward my goals”.

Belief is important because if you don’t actually believe it’s possible then you won’t do the work to make it happen. The good news is, human potential is nearly unlimited and you can achieve almost anything you can imagine without limitation.";16;0.06666666666666667;[[0.96921088]];[[0.55289086]];0.3776;0.109;0.784;0.107;0.9952;0.136;0.794;0.07;-0.064;-0.05385487528344672;0.10633012820512824;-0.16018500348857495

This could be helped medically by a) getting the right amount of sleep, b) eating properly and c) exercising. Exercising might help you get tired earlier on in the day so you go to bed earlier, and will help you concentrate. Trying to engage yourself in things that require long periods of concentration might help. Get off social media, get off your phone - just turn it off - and try to concentrate hard and properly on a book or a movie, maybe in the cinema.  Push yourself to do half an hour of studying, and if you feel like you can do more, just keep going. There are apps and browser extensions that can curb procrastination by literally blocking websites for a duration of time.

Also, maybe you need something to get up for. You need to really feel in your bones that you want to do well, not just recognise that where you’re at right now won’t get you any further.

Don't force yourself to learn when you don't want to or hate it, and don't force yourself to watch someone that is slow if you know you can find someone that explains better/faster.

There are three states: Entertainment - Doing nothing - Doing work.

It's always best to do literally nothing and you'd be surprised at just how hard that is. Also, feel free any time you are hating or disliking learning to instantly stop and do nothing. If you do nothing until you feel like doing some work, even for a little bit, then that is good enough. 

Also, use ttsreader.com you can put in online pdfs or books that might let you learn some stuff while you are walking around, driving, or something else.

edit: You people are inspirational. I am very thankful for every answer";240;"I've had a lot of problems with sleep early in my life. Roughly from age 11 to 27 I've gone to sleep between 2-5am regardless of when I've had to wake up.

However, I managed to start waking up early when I committed, and I mean TRULY committed to the idea of JUMPING out of the bed the second the alarm goes off.

I noticed that when I made a firm commitment to it, my subconscious started to comply. The first thought in my head is ""UP UP UP"" when the alarm goes off. Sometimes I'm so sleepy that I sit for a while before suiting up, but once I get up it gets better.

If you try to half-ass it, you lose. If you stay in bed after you hit snooze, you will never fix it.

Don't skip this unless you are so sick that you have to sleep in. You need to make this into a habit. If you think you can't do this, you will never be able to fix it. I've tried everything else and this is the only thing that works reliably.

If you need to fix the schedule (going to sleep earlier), you go to sleep 10-15 minutes earlier each night and wake up 10-15 minutes earlier until it's fixed. You can't fix it by going to sleep 2 hours earlier.

As for the learning difficulties, you have to develop your focus. Being distracted is a habit that you've cultivated over time. It's not your fault, but it's your responsibility to fix it. Read a few books related to habits and focus. 

Unless you are mentally challenged, you have roughly the same capabilities as everyone else. There are people who like to fiddle with computers on their free time and dedicate time to understand that stuff. That's the difference between you and them. It's the time that they've used to understanding the things. If you put in the time, you start to notice that you understand things better than the average person.

It's not any kind of ""innate"" understanding. It's just about putting in the time and focus.

If you have depression, anxiety and so on, again, it's not your fault, but it's your responsibility. Even mild depression can be super dangerous (I get depressed when I'm sick more than two days and it takes real effort to get on track) because it makes you feel like you'll never feel better. To have focus on one area of your life, you have to take care of other areas. Exercise, preferably weight lifting at gym, learn to cultivate positive energy, reading, writing, being more positive, learning new stuff and so on help me a lot.

Life is all about momentum. The more you do, the more active you are, the more you feel like being active and the better you feel. The more you surf mindlessly, watch TV and so on, your momentum goes to zero and you feel like shit. It's crucial to keep momentum up. If you feel exhausted, enjoy a break, but you have to get back on track because once you lose it it becomes 10x harder to build it again.

Experiment with all this stuff. Read books. There's info that WILL help you, you just have to find it. Make your own conclusions what works for you.

Your writing reveals that you've been conditioned with low self-esteem. It's not how you are, it's how you were brought up to be. It's not your fault, but you need to fix it yourself. You have to start to understand better that all people are the same in the end, but the limiting beliefs that people have make it seem different. Again, there are bunch of books that will help you with this and endless resources in forms of blogs, forums, subreddits and so on.

Become HUMBLE. Admit to yourself that your conditioning is CRAP. Ego is useless. Only then will you be open to change.

edit: You people are inspirational. I am very thankful for every answer";240;"I’ve never, ever been a morning person and now I wake up at 6am every day. Getting up early I’ve found is as simple as this- when your alarm goes off GET UP! Out of bed and moving. Open the blinds, make coffee and get in the shower. 

It doesn’t matter if you’re dead tired when the alarm sounds. Once you’re moving about you start to wake up. 

You might be tired for the rest of the day but guess what? You’ll be ready for bed earlier too and start getting into a rhythm of up early, sleep early. 

Regarding your feelings of cerebral inferiority I get that too. I’m not the top of the class in my work place anymore and it can be difficult to stop the comparisons and not beat yourself over the head with them but two things- let your competitive spirit fly to motivate you as opposed to beating yourself up. While you’re distracting yourself with negative self-talk you’re using up your capacity to learn. Secondly, get in with the clever kids! They can help you learn. Get them to explain concepts you don’t quite understand- people love showing off their knowledge and it will cement their own understanding. They’re a fantastic untapped resource for you! And remember, you’re only as good as the company you keep so aim high. 

Good luck. ";3;0.0125;[[0.96477437]];[[0.60005616]];0.3776;0.109;0.784;0.107;0.9435;0.159;0.723;0.11800000000000001;-0.039000000000000014;-0.05385487528344672;0.14644927536231886;-0.20030415064576554
[NeedAdvice] I don't know how to start getting out of bed earlier and how to stop procrastinating and get to learning;t3_7uz9r8;21;"Hey guys,

I study CompSci and right now the semester ended and exams are coming up. My first exam is in about 3 weeks. I wanted to start learning about 1-2 months ago but I just can't get the ball rolling. I sleep in every day. Setting an alarm helps rarely. Then it's too late for me to learn, I feel as I have wasted half of the day already.



I know it is really bad for me and that I am just sabotaging myself. I don't want to fail my exams. I find a different distraction all the time, even when my mobile phone is across the room. Watching videos to learn works for me sometimes, but I can't do that for a long time. When I get to doing the exercises I get frustrated after about 2 minutes and I just give up. I can not concentrate and I don't know why.


I have been a good student in school, but in university I feel stupid. Everyone seems to know more than me and be smarter than me (and they usually are) just because I can't learn. I have tried learning for a fixed amount of time, do a short break and continue learning but that doesn't work either. The very reason I am writing this post is because it's easier than learning.

What can I do to fix this?

That does two things: a) allows your brain to consolidate short term memories into long term memories. 2) allows your brain to perform its nightly maintenance, including flushing out impurities between neurons. 
2. Study for 30 to 60 minutes. Then take a short break to relax. 
3. Try to exercise for 20 to 30 minutes a day. That helps to grow neurons, and it helps you to better focus. 
4. Be realistic with time schedule. Postpone or cancel anything that is not going to help you achieve goals. For example, limit amount of time surfing internet, reddit or other social media sites. 
5. Try B12 lozenges. It can help with focus and energy, especially if your body does not absorb B12 from food very well.

So, what I will do now:

* I will set an alarm and just get up. Jump out of bed, no snooze, no excuses
* I will start taking a walk in the mornings, atleast 3 times a week (or I will try)
* I have always been curious about meditation. It seems that it really helps, so I will give that a try (I have experimented, but never gotten into it)

Hopefully productivity will rise after I have done that. Maybe play less video games and read more/pursue my hobbies.

Loss of motivation, apathy, feelings of inadequacy or worthlessness, inability to carry out everyday tasks (like exercising or reading,) etc., that’s pretty textbook depression (disclaimer: I am not a mental health professional, but a neuroscientist. My experience with mental health is limited to my own [severe depression and anxiety] and what I’ve read in textbooks lol)

Depression doesn’t always affect people 100% of the time.  You can still be happy some days, laugh at jokes, do your work, and feel ‘not-depressed’ but still have depression! I don’t want to say that you definitely have depression, but I think it wouldn’t hurt to visit a psychiatrist and get a professional opinion. (One of my tests for myself is whether or not I feel like making an appointment with my doctor. If I can’t be bothered to call, I’m probably in a depressive state. YMMV though.) And even if you don’t have depression, therapy is still super useful for people without mental health issues! Go to a doctor and get all of the other tests mentioned in this thread, but also ask about the possibility that you may have depression, just in case!

[Need advice] I Feel like I need to Reinvent myself to save myself .....I just don't know.;t3_87k06o;4;"As this is my first post in r/getdisciplined, I'd like to say hello to everyone first and foremost! With that out of the way, here's my problem...but Bane of my existence feels more accurate. Sorry if this post turns out long.

I've been battling procrastination for god knows how long and it just eats away at me everyday that passes. It's like a soul eating engine that just fucks you over full circle time and time again no matter what you do, but for me it's for a different reason. Ever since I was 16 I was acutely aware about what my likes and dislikes were as a person. I knew what drove me and what didn't motivate me to act. I had self awareness of myself and even to this day I'm grateful for that, but now it's killing me no matter where I run in my mind. At 27, it's even more clear to me how much my mind won't let me try to escape.

It hurts when you know your good at something. It's painful when you know you have a natural talent for something. But it brings some to tears knowing you have the potential to be great at something but you don't do anything because you don't FEEL like it. Or because the hard work makes you feel uneasy while full well knowing it's the only path to you. It just makes you feel like your letting your gifts go to waste. I randomly found music production when I was 16 and not in a good place, following crowds, fads and not being authentic. But that random download of music software on my computer at that time literally changed my life. Got new friends, gave me confidence, allowed me to be a nerd about games and music. But most of all made me realize that I had a knack for something more than video games. I spent 8 years learning all I could about music production. Chords, mixing, mastering, all the things I needed that could make me a better musician or composer I would learn it to the best of my ability. I learned so much from that time. Sticking to my own guns, agreeing to disagree with family members, that everyone won't see your vision the way you do. I grew as a person, along with my musical skills and it felt great. But when I hit 23, went to college for it, for some reason, my drive just....left me. I got lazy. I put things off. My grades dropped. And I got kicked out of college. I literally went to college for something I LOVED.....and I failed. It fucks with me even today...because I know the reason it happened was because of me.

It fucks with you even more when you feel so shitty NOT ONLY disappointing yourself, but the people who put their faith and trust in you the most. Even now, I can feel that uncomfortable, uneasy feeling in my chest like I want to run away and stop typing. Distract myself with video games or fictional books to get rid of this feeling in my chest. But if I knew how to fix this, I would have done it. Maybe I do but I still haven't done it.

Worst of all, when your aware of everything, including your mistakes, I can't forgive myself because I know that I had the chance to change. To get up. To do better. And I don't. And I hate myself for it. And you would figure being in enough pain would get me to change....and yet somehow it hasn't....and cue waterworks.

I'm just tired. Of disappointing myself. And the people who've trusted me time and time again. Full well knowing what it meant and what would happen if I failed. And still didn't do anything. Still didn't fucking do anything. I need discipline, focus, consistency and I know that if I could hold myself accountable to it and get my ass in gear I could. But I haven't. But beyond all this, the thing that eats at me and makes me tear up even thinking about it is knowing I didn't do right by the very thing that changed my life for the better. It's like knowing that you disappointed that one person you knew changed your life for the better. Even now it's bringing me to tears.

For those who were in similar spots, how did you get your ass in gear and save yourself from your procrastination? Again, sorry for the long post. I'm not really one to make long explanations but...

I'm just in....PAIN man...

But it brings some to tears knowing you have the potential to be great at something but you don't do anything because you don't FEEL like it. Or because the hard work makes you feel uneasy while full well knowing it's the only path to you. It just makes you feel like your letting your gifts go to waste. I randomly found music production when I was 16 and not in a good place, following crowds, fads and not being authentic. But that random download of music software on my computer at that time literally changed my life. Got new friends, gave me confidence, allowed me to be a nerd about games and music. But most of all made me realize that I had a knack for something more than video games. I spent 8 years learning all I could about music production. Chords, mixing, mastering, all the things I needed that could make me a better musician or composer I would learn it to the best of my ability. I learned so much from that time. Sticking to my own guns, agreeing to disagree with family members, that everyone won't see your vision the way you do. I grew as a person, along with my musical skills and it felt great. But when I hit 23, went to college for it, for some reason, my drive just....left me. I got lazy. I put things off. My grades dropped. And I got kicked out of college. I literally went to college for something I LOVED.....and I failed. It fucks with me even today...because I know the reason it happened was because of me.

It fucks with you even more when you feel so shitty NOT ONLY disappointing yourself, but the people who put their faith and trust in you the most. Even now, I can feel that uncomfortable, uneasy feeling in my chest like I want to run away and stop typing. Distract myself with video games or fictional books to get rid of this feeling in my chest. But if I knew how to fix this, I would have done it. Maybe I do but I still haven't done it.

Worst of all, when your aware of everything, including your mistakes, I can't forgive myself because I know that I had the chance to change. To get up. To do better. And I don't. And I hate myself for it. And you would figure being in enough pain would get me to change....and yet somehow it hasn't....and cue waterworks.

I'm just tired. Of disappointing myself. And the people who've trusted me time and time again. Full well knowing what it meant and what would happen if I failed. And still didn't do anything. Still didn't fucking do anything. I need discipline, focus, consistency and I know that if I could hold myself accountable to it and get my ass in gear I could. But I haven't. But beyond all this, the thing that eats at me and makes me tear up even thinking about it is knowing I didn't do right by the very thing that changed my life for the better. It's like knowing that you disappointed that one person you knew changed your life for the better. Even now it's bringing me to tears.

For those who were in similar spots, how did you get your ass in gear and save yourself from your procrastination? Again, sorry for the long post. I'm not really one to make long explanations but...

";5;"While this may not be easy (but honestly what is), you have to let go of what happened to you before.  Time travels in one direction and you can never go back to what happened and fix it.  

That being said, you are not the same person that you were yesterday or those many years ago.  With your daily thoughts and behaviors you are constantly changing.  The fact that you wrote this post is a pretty clear sign that you are beginning to change as an individual and you are taking the first steps on your journey.  

Being in a similar place as you and almost out of it, I want you to know that you are never defined by your previous actions as long as you believe in your heart that those previous actions were wrong.  You are not the person that ""never accomplishes anything"".  You are the person that ""did not accomplish things previously in their life"".  These are not characteristics of your personality that are set in stone.  These are actions that have happened and can change - same as when you break your arm and it heals.

However, it is important to note that breaking your arm may leave a scar.  Similarly, your previous actions have left a scar in your mind.  But you have to view this scar as a positive outcome because moving forward you will remember what not to do and your experiences will make you a stronger and better person.  

Right now I would like to tell you that no matter what - DO NOT GIVE UP and fall into the void of what has happened.  A natural part of life is that it is absolutely not easy.  You are only 27 and that means that you have another 3/4 of your life left to do as you please.  That is 75% of which 10% you were a child.  You have plenty of life to live!!!

And one last thing I would like to leave you with.  This is an article of five celebrities (there are many more) that have turned their lives around from terrible situations.  Its all a mindset game and you are on your way to figuring it out.

I've been battling procrastination for god knows how long and it just eats away at me everyday that passes. It's like a soul eating engine that just fucks you over full circle time and time again no matter what you do, but for me it's for a different reason. Ever since I was 16 I was acutely aware about what my likes and dislikes were as a person. I knew what drove me and what didn't motivate me to act.

[Need Advice] Let's freeze life, f*** a few people over and start again shall we?;t3_7x377y;2;"the short of it: I was in a few strong relationships and am having to say fuck it, save family I am apparently going to be alone and fixing my life. i am in a menial job until i fix my grades and learn things to tutor others or get an engineering training position. I'm 28, living with my folks. I have credit card debt, have some addictions that I'd like to get rid of and there are talents and experiences I'd like to have before I get married.

To attempt to maintain the longevity of my need to fix myself and make permanent fixes does anyone have any suggestions in regards to starting over beyond you know, one thing a day and being patient with yourself? I'm reading the FAQ and I'm seeing things that will help. But I need.. MORE. Think of this as the radical korean full body plastic surgery, ima be a star makeover. I have no intentions of overwhelming myself but there is a lot of time and this month, the goal is to start breaking into some unbreakable habits. This is drastic this is me knowing I am going to fail a million times and have to put myself back together. I can do that. I already have failed so many times so what's a few more. I don't like myself right now, I don't even want to recognize myself. If you have any suggestions on the things I am working on below to get my core stabilized that aren't in the FAQ and aren't about being patient with myself or overwhelming myself I would love to hear it.

Goals: 

 the upper echelon of this list top priority.

1. Wake up at 4am, sleep at 9pm.. unless i fucked up my studies.
1. Exercise, be able to run a 5k in 8 weeks (c25k baby).
1. Make studies priority: 4 hours a day. Or 2 hours per target subject.
1. Memory retention work: I'm losing my memory so making records and going back through what I know and getting learning experience in things I care about is very very important.
1. Keep shit clean. Apparently, I seriously suck at this and may be a good candidate for hoarders r us.
1. calm the fuck down and keep a stable outward persona, because no one is worth getting so worked up over and I need my brains for better things. I have never met a problem that I didn't survive in the end and I am losing a lot more when i look like i'm losing my shit-- which is often.

1. maintain energy levels. yeahhh you should have downtime, it's critical but not a decade of it.

30 days from now have completed: 

1. Get an accountability buddy.
1. stabilize the upper enchalon
1. secure an A in my chemistry classes.
1. be prepared to take a physics and a math exam.
1. figure out how for me to best learn shit and take tests
1. sort my anxieties and stop my panic attacks, calm for life.. yay
1. prep to exit my job, because it might kind of suck half the time.

What am I doing to move this along: 

1. journaling and maintaining a bullet journal.
1. asking for advice
1. gathering my need to dos so i can plan it out
1. stepping back from things to determine where I stand and if it is necessary and limiting how much I'm doing so i don't get overwhelmed.
1. being civil.
1. trying to find more things to make me laugh so i'm not as serious and depressed all the time and pushing for my hobbies.";1;"Sounds like you've got a good plan going, so I think if you maintain this you'll definitely see improvements!

But I will say that liking yourself is pretty critical to ultimately being happy. I don't mean being content with the status quo. But seeing yourself as a work in progress and being okay with that. Working on being comfortable with who you are -- a worthy and valuable person trying to get better -- is important.

Personally, the anger and frustration towards myself only got me so far. Because, eventually, you're going to improve, and you're going to like yourself again, and you're not going to be so angry or frustrated anymore. And then what will drive you? Will you slip back and have to do it all over again? 

Still liking yourself when life is shit is invaluable. I think of them as my ""I'm okay but I need to get better"" muscles. Important to work those too.

It sounds like you're on the right track, but just something to think about! And good luck!";2;2.0;[[0.95914915]];[[0.47730036]];-0.4894;0.12300000000000001;0.755;0.122;0.9841;0.254;0.6809999999999999;0.065;-0.188;0.1431403672580143;0.16811904761904764;-0.024978680361033345

Consistent and daily meditation would help so much with the issue you are dealing with. Meditation is a great way to build mental discipline. I've been doing it twice a day almost everyday for about 4 months. Before I started meditating it was so easy to fall into a bad mood at work. A lot of the times I'd be looking at the clock every 45 mins wanting to go home so bad. Now whenever a negative thought about being at work comes to my mind i can dismiss it immediately and keep my mind on work. This is just one example.

[Get this book](https://smile.amazon.com/Mini-Habits-Weight-Loss-Suffering/dp/0996435441/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) if you can afford it.  It might be at your local library too.  You could probably get similar information from youtube/google if you search ""how to build a habit"".

try meditating for the stress.  There is a website/app called [headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), but you have to pay for it.  There is another one called [insight timer](https://insighttimer.com/) that is free and I've heard is really good.  They should have a section for beginners.  The more you do it, the more it helps.  Maybe do it before bed, it should help you sleep.

Creating a to-do list each day might make life a little more organized and less stressful.

Journaling for 5-10 minutes at night may also help.  

Good for you for reaching out.  Continue to do that.  There are a lot of different subreddits with people willing to help.";3;0.5;[[0.97101817]];[[0.48360023]];0.7116;0.126;0.8029999999999999;0.071;0.9817;0.195;0.74;0.065;-0.075;0.18281144781144784;0.2505208333333333;-0.06770938552188546

also, if financially possible, frequent a gym. if it’s not possible, you can still workout at home or at a park nearby and change your eating habits to a healthier one.

It may be terrifying and overwhelming, but it's still a wonderful thing.

I myself have lost 100 lbs (and I have two kids) so I know something of what you are going through.  The most important thing when you are overwhelmed is to just find the tiniest step in the right direction and take it.  Then, you just repeat that process.

You want to simplify everything and ideally before that baby gets here, when things are going to become even more overwhelming.  Pick a diet that is simple but works and just make it a habit.  I used (and still use) /r/keto.  At my most overwhelmed, I don't count calories or plan my eating or buy the healthiest foods, I just follow one simple rule: don't eat carbs.  I'll eat McDonald's burgers without their buns if I have to.  I've taken the insides out of sandwiches at work and after funerals.  I've eaten the hospital salad bar for days in a row when my baby was in the NICU.  I carried a giant bag of almonds with me to snack whenever I needed to.  Just simple, don't even have to think about it.

You also want to work on your mental health.  I can tell you right now that you can drastically improve that almost immediately.  If the only thing you do is stop labeling yourself, you will feel a million times better.  

You named yourself ""FatLazyLoser!""  Imagine naming your baby that and calling him/her FatLazyLoser as they grow up.  How do you think they would act?  How much self-esteem would they have?  You are not lazy, because nobody is lazy.  People ACT lazy.  They can stop whenever they choose to.  Nobody is a loser, either.  That's not a thing.  You can lose things, but you can't be a loser.  Even ""fat"" is misleading as a label.  YOU aren't fat, YOU are a human being who has a lot of fat on your body.

If you can swing it, find a way to get some therapy ASAP so you can work on those negative thoughts.  They make you depressed and unmotivated.  (Speaking from experience here!)  If you can't, check out a book called [Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336), which will teach you how to basically give yourself therapy.

I tend to be perfectionistic and very self-critical. It extended to being critical of others, which I hated, and realized that's why I needed to change. 

I try to be open and kind with myself, like a therapist would do. Tell myself it's okay to feel this way, and it's understandable. Then remind myself that I'm doing x goal because it's good for me, not to avoid self-criticism. 

Now, I eat healthy because I know it's good for me, NOT because that's the bare minimum I need to do to not be a piece of shit.

";198;"I think the difference is doing something you have to and something you want to. For some of us (myself included), I work  very well if I know I have to do it (as long as I get the results and satisfaction out of it). When I was studying in my last year of highschool I used to do 13 hour days. I used to study maths for hours on end, I would dream it. At university, I crammed my heart out before exams but all I ""had"" to do was get a pass and so I did enough to get that. Now I work a piss easy job, short hours, great pay and I can't be stuffed doing anything with my time besides binge watching netflix. Why? Because I don't *have* to do anything. 

My two solutions are: making yourself accountable somehow; sign up to a personal trainer so someone is calling you saying ""Where the f are you?"" when you don't show up or sign yourself up to a sport so that if you don't turn up, you let the team down. There's also a subreddit where you can get an accountability buddy [r/accountability](https://www.reddit.com/r/accountability/). And the second point, don't burn yourself out. Just do one thing and stick to it. Do a little thing. Then eventually you can build on it. I think those that know their full potential burn out the most because they expect to pick up that discipline right where they left of. Nope. Discipline is a muscle that you have to train until it's doing it on its own. If you haven't used it in a while, it's probably lazing on the couch with cheetos fingers. That means you've gotta force yourself when you don't want to but because you have to, to get that discipline going.

And now if you'll excuse me... I'll go back to ignoring my own advice and continue watching netflix :(";5;0.025252525252525252;[[0.968728]];[[0.72753619]];0.6135;0.131;0.752;0.11699999999999999;0.6764;0.066;0.894;0.04;-0.012000000000000005;0.019191919191919187;0.1226662887377173;-0.10347436954579813

Sometimes a better take on work is figuring out how to be the most effective with the least amount of effort expended. 

It goes against human nature to max yourself out constantly. If anything your lack of motivation is likely stemming from some part of you attempting to keep you from that high-stress routine again.

Of course that's not to say that the things others mentioned like exercise and healthy diet habits aren't important - just from my experience, I do think that work has a very essential part to play in our lives :)

Another thought I had is the possibility of depression - that can have a huge impact on your motivation. Even if you don't feel overwhelmingly down, a mild but persistent depression might be a possible reason. Would it be possible for you to talk to your doctor about a referral to a psychologist?

";198;"You had a great deal of structure in your life from external forces, which basically required you to keep busy.  You had an extremely clear task, mandated by an authority figure of some kind, for 80-90 hours a week.  Your life now lacks that structure.

You're a person wired to thrive within a structure with a clear authority.  That's not a bad thing, regardless of what some elements of society tell you.  

So, how do you develop that authority?  You look for situations where you have a ""coach"" or a ""boss"" or a ""supervisor"" that guides you toward short term goals and tasks.  If you want to exercise, hire a personal trainer that you meet with once a week that doles out ""homework.""  If you want to learn, sign up for a class at a local college.  Put yourself in a structure where you are given clear tasks to complete by an authority figure and you'll find more success.

It takes time to get momentum with discipline and the same to become sloppy. You can work your way back towards discipline. Start small, track your goals, break them into small obtainable steps. Find your reasons and purpose. Reminds yourself every day. Get friends, family or therapists, or personal trainers to help you.

Start by practicing paying attention and identifying options.

";198;"Did I see in one of the comments you are working nights? My husband worked nights for a couple years... he gradually became pretty beat down just like this. He wasn't ""depressed"" - still happy life, happy family, everything was good, making plenty of money - he just gradually seemed like he lost his motivation towards anything &amp; definitely lost his will to exercise (and he is an ex-pro-athlete and current ultramarathoner, so exercise is a massive part of his life.) It was 100% due to messing with his the circadian rhythm like that. Working nights is EXTREMELY hard on your body, there are a lot of things that just don't happen properly when we're not in bed at night, even if we sleep OK during the day. Once he switched to days, he was fine within a few weeks. Probably even within 1 week. I don't know if that's possible for you, but definitely not something to underestimate.

I also want to just say that ebbs &amp; flows in motivation are totally normal. I have owned my own creative business for the last decade where I set my own schedule to a large extent, and over the course of every year I have months of amazing motivation and peak productivity, and times where I just don't feel like working at all and I have to drag myself into my office to maintain the minimum effort. It's like everything else in the world - there are seasons. Gotta have winter to have spring and all that. There are recessions in every business cycle on a pretty predictable time table, which clears out the field for a new growth phase. When I feel frustrated with myself in one of these cycles I just try to be kind to myself and relax because I know the motivation will come back, and it always does! I think honestly people trying to push themselves through these natural rest/regroup periods is leading to tons of adrenal fatigue and stress based disease.

I was studying what I loved and was working for a purpose. 

I guess I did all of that out of necessity... it's been 5 years and I cannot replicate that discipline. My job is boring and I'm mostly staring at a computer solving networking issues. My first year out of school I took it easy and had one full time job and two part time jobs. Then I brought it down to one FT and one PT for two years. Then it's been one FT ever since! 

There are so many things I want to do and I won't do them. 

I can't commit to anything. Not a diet, not a fitness plan, not a project. I lack motivation and discipline in every way possible and it drives me crazy because I won't stop! I don't know how I got here :( 

Anyways, maybe I need to post here to feel responsible :| I'd like to hear about the moment you decided to get it together and how you stuck to you. ";198;"Sometimes i feel ready to take on the world and sometimes i don't. I have spent long periods of time building stress because of my aspirations, and not setting out to do them.

U was at a.. like a soup kitchen but wealthier. Had to help make the meal to get a free meal. In the beginning I was studying there. It was surprising just how unaxcepted it was to study there despite no obvious rules. People would tell me to move because they needed to play board games. What.the.fuck. There more similiar power dynamics at play. I tried to limit my time helping and realized helping out shopping max took like 5-10 minutes. Suddenly for only that activity you had to draw straws to get the duty.  It was insane the crab mentality. I also had a fitness membership that I had to cancel to be anle to get that free meal.

When you are in ""crazy"" mode like you mentioned you were in the past, your brain is tuned to do one thing after another, you feel awesome because you are achieving things and if there is a moment idle, your brain finds something else to do. 

Likewise, when you are down and bored, you feel lazy, you don't want to do anything, and even the slightest effort seems like a mountain. You can try to break the ""bad momentum"" maybe by taking some holidays and going on an active trip.

I have time to keep my grade up but if I don't act soon, I might be doomed. What discipline system can I use?

Edit: I actually don't use my phone that much; the issue is that I'm just not interested in my classes. Even if I were to block websites, I'd just walk outside and listen to music. If not that, I'd read a book, and it goes on.";16;"Try studying in a different location, like the library or an unused classroom. Definitely turn off all alerts from distracting apps (including texting,) or put your phone on do not disturb and store it in a distant drawer while studying. You might need to take a break from growing your instragram base if it interferes with your classes. You need to make it very hard to access anything even remotely appealing so there’s nothing else for you to do except study.


It’s a good idea to not have your phone around when studying. You could try giving it to a friend or roommate while you’re studying so it won’t distract you. As for your computer, there’s this program called self control for macs or cold turkey for PC’s that will really help. You put in a list of all the sites that might distract you and then set a timer. As long as the timer is running, you will not be able to go to the distracting websites (even if you restart your computer and uninstall the app, there’s no way around it so those sites will be blocked until the timer is finished.) It’s a bit extreme, but you already said you can’t rely on yourself to stop procrastinating on the internet. I think this program, along with giving your phone to someone else, will help you to get away from the distractions.

If discipline isn’t working for you, try a rewards system as well. Like, eat a piece of candy after every paragraph you read. Only let yourself go on your phone after 30+ minutes of studying. Or even better, only take/post/look at stuff on instagram AFTER you’ve finished studying for the day. It will be very hard to do, but you can start small and work your way up (first day just 5 minutes of studying, then go up to 10 or 15, and just keep increasing until you’re studying enough to understand the material from your classes.) Remember that starting a task is much more difficult than the actual task itself. 

I have really bad depression so I have trouble going out of my comfort zone, and my therapist suggesting starting tasks by doing the bare minimum that I can do. For example, if dishes are piled in my sink, I only need to do one dish per day, or if my clothes are piling up, I only need to fold one shirt (but if I want to do more, that’s totally cool.) It really, really helps me because it breaks down big tasks into small, doable bits and pieces. It also helped me realize that starting a task is so much worse than actually doing it! Now, I’ll wash multiple dishes but I feel no pressure to wash them all because at least I did something. Baby steps are still progress.

There is just very high tendency to interpret other people's actions or non-actions in a negative light.  Stress puts us into ""everyone's in a conspiracy against me"" mode.

Look college is not easy for everybody. You're in your FIRST year in school, NOBODY knows what they're doing. Your brothers are absolute dumbasses for teasing you and it's probably a projection of some insecurity that they have in their lives.

Take control of your life. You deserve better. Figure out why you're not doing well in your  courses. You mention you have lab? 

I'm a biology graduate, so I'm going to just assume that you're majoring in the life sciences since you brought up lab. A science major is not meant for EVERYBODY. Some of the brightest people I know SUCK at lab.

So go talk to a guidance counselor and write down what INTERESTS YOU. Not your mom. Not your dad. YOU. What is important for you?

Because if you wake up in the morning and dread what you have to do for the rest of your life, you're going to be a very miserable individual. 

Your parents are narcissistic and your family is a terrible support group. This is from what you've told me and what I can glean. You need to take initiative to better your life.

I'm sorry I'm being forward but I don't want you to pity yourself. If you pity your situation, you're just signaling the parts of your brain that communicate comfort and hopefulness for the future.

You need concrete action. That action will translate to results. That results will translate to comfort. Take action.

[Need Advice] Dealing with Extinction Burst;t3_8326u3;2;Hello guys, long-time lurker and first-time poster here. Been trying to get my shit together for 27 years and counting. I recently realize that my biggest hurdle when overcoming bad habits / forming new healthy habits is dealing with Extinction Burst. [Link for anyone unfamiliar with the concept](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/07/07/extinction-burst/). Has anyone developed a good technique / system for dealing with this phenomenon? I tend to fall back to my old habits when I eventually fail at my new routine / regiment. I think of myself as a failure and I go back to soothing myself with instant gratification. The article gives some advice but I was wondering if anyone had any personal anecdotes on how they previously overcome their own inner tantrums. Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks to everyone here in advance. You guys are awesome.;7;"First, start as small as humanly possible. If you want to work out, just do 1 push up a day EVERY SINGLE DAY NO MATTER WHAT. Or make a pact with yourself that you will go to the gym 3 times a week NO MATTER WHAT. My wife and I did that a few years back and there were literally times where I was sick, i would drive to the gym, walk in, lift one weight, and then go home. But I went. That's all that mattered. We did that for a full year and I was in incredible shape. 

Second, be kind to yourself. Know that you are going to have setbacks and you are going to fail. GOOD! Fail hard! Failure is the greatest thing that can happen to you. Forgive yourself. Always remember that the secret is that you only fail when you quit. ""Failure"" is just another word for learning. 

If you are afraid to fail you will be afraid to try anything. Every time you fail, learn something from it. When I wanted to make more time for myself to work on my writing, I decided that starting a business and working from home would be the best way to do that. Okay.....now what? Well, I was interested in video production and I knew computers pretty well, so I decided to start a small web design and video production business. I had just read the Walter Isaacson biography of Benjamin Franklin so I had a ton of fire and motivation to start a business so I literally opened Pages on my computer and wrote at the top ""The 30 day failure plan"" and then wrote out something that I would fail at for 30 days. Examples were: find someone doing what I want to do and meet with them (expecting to fail, a.k.a learn). Start learning how to make a website, etc. 

I went in expecting to fail. I wanted to fail! I wanted to fall flat on my ass so then I could get back up and say ""okay, that didn't work. Now I know that. Now I'm smarter"". Within a few months I was able to quit my job and work from home. I basically had no fear.

[NeedAdvice] Wanting advice on how to start being organised, productive. Feel stuck and aimless at 24.;t3_83ia2f;2;"Howdy everyone, this post is going to be awkwardly vague, but that's exactly the problem in the same sense too.

I'm 24 and have just glided through life without much thought and purpose. For some more general context on my situation, I am some what recently single, have an easy-ish/mostly stressfree job but with pretty bad pay, not in a field I really care about. I feel like I am existing with no purpose. I haven't challenged myself and haven't bettered myself (both in a physical and mental sense).

I want to be a better person for my sake and for my friends and family. 

I suffer from bouts of apathy, procrastination and general laziness. I'm still in my youth but feel if I don't actively start changing things and start making more of an effort I am going to completely waste what left of it there is. I'm just wanting a bit advice/tips on how to: get organised, be more productive, improve myself and finding a drive/goal to aim for.

I know there isn't an easy answer for any of this. Even just some advice from someone who used to be like this would be amazing though. Thank you for your time reading this and I hope you're having a great day so far.

For referenence here are some things I want to do too:

- Get physically fit
- Learn to eat healthy, learn how to cook properly
- Find ways to manage my spare time and use it effectively instead of wasting it online/gaming.
- Be more aware of the world, challenge self mentally.
- Stop being passive and being active with every aspect of life.";6;"Dude, congrats for being so self aware at such a young age. Now forget I said anything about age. Forget what number you are, it wil only hold you back. You’re an adult now, that’s all that matters. From now on you’re in the same boat as every other human on the planet. 

So how to get you out of your funk?

First, the abstract part. Figure out what you want to do with your life. You don’t have to figure out the specific job, that will just come naturally, but sit down for a good hour or two and think about what is important to you and what you think would be fun to do for the rest of your life. For me, that’s easy. I love movies. So I’m just gonna keep making movies until I can’t. 

So do you want to help humanity by ensuring it’s survival by making humans a multi planet species? (Elon Musk and Space X). Do you want to help humanity by helping people to ease their suffering and increase their happiness through meditation? (Dan Harris and 10% Happier) Do you want to help humanity by entertaining them, taking people on adventures and exploring what it means to be human in this vast universe? (Stanley Kubrick and his films)

Figure out what is important to you. “What do you want to do with your life” is too vague a question. Think about it in terms of “what is important to me that I can do to help myself and the rest of humanity”. This works for any job out there. 

Once you’ve done that, the best way to move forward is to find people who are already doing that thing, or truly aspiring to do it, and become their friends. This is MANDATORY. Very few people do anything great on their own. Find people that inspire you and that you can inspire. Plus, friends are just fun. Friends who share your interest are even better. 

Okay, now onto the nitty gritty actionable stuff. 

ONE: Get fit: This is simple, but not easy. The best way to get fit is to choose the exercise that you’d like to do and join a group. So if you like yoga,join a studio. Weights, find a gym buddy or take a weight lifting class. Running? Find a running group or running buddy. Always be watching videos and reading books about the fitness you like so you can learn more and keep being inspired. For me, I like yoga and body weight exercises so I use ClassPass to visit lots of different yoga studios around me. And then the body weight stuff, I have a friend across the country that we check in with each other and y’all about our process and tips and yes, will text photos of ourselves without shirts off. That’s weird. 

If you want to get started with exercise, the absolute best thing you can do is:
-interval training: look it up. There’s a book called the one minute workout, or something like that, that has a clickbaity title (the author freely admits) but it’s written by a scientist who studied interval training and found that literally 10 minutes of interval training is better than 1 hour of steady state exercise. No joke. It’s awesome. 

-basic body weight exercises: do push ups and pull ups and sit ups or ab rollers. You can do these at home. You can start very small. Start with literally 1 push up a day. But do it EVERY SINGLE DAY NO MATTER FUCKING WHAT!!!!! Eventually you’ll do two and then theee and once the habit is established you can start getting more advanced. 

TWO: Eat healthy: go on YouTube and watch the nutrition videos from the Channel “What I’ve Learned”. The basics are this: stop eating sugar. Stop eating processed foods. Stop eating white carbs. Stop eating an excess of red meat (stop meat totally if you can, if not then focus on fish and poultry), start eating lots of veggies and healthy fats. 

Another great way to kickstart a healthy diet is to follow Tim Ferriss’s “slow carb diet” which is outlined in the four hour body and all across the web. This diet is easy as fuck because you can eat as much as you want and you’re able to do this because you’re avoiding processed foods, sugar, and white carbs. Also you get 1 day a week to eat literally anything you want. SUPER easy way to start a healthy diet. 

Start coooking your meals and doing meal prep. What I’ll do is buy a ton of frozen veggies, brown rice, black beans, spinach, tofu, salmon and I’ll cook it all up and then make my meals for the week. I eat lunch at work and always get a salad with fish. Take the thought out of your eating. Don’t make choices. Have everything planned out. Makes it easier. You don’t HAVE to prep every meal but have at least one meal per day ready to eat just in case you get home and are starving. It wi keep you from eating shit from a fast food joint. 

Also, read “food rules” by Michael Pollan. Very simple. 

THREE: Manage your spare time. First off, appreciate that you have spare time!!! I literally work from the moment I wake up in the morning until about 7-9pm at night (luckily I love my job). My weekends are my only personal time and usually I’m trying to catch up with everything I’ve needed to do personally over the week or spend time with friends so the actual spare time is close to zero. 

Use this time wisely while you still have it! If you have spare time then you’re not trying hard enough. You should be constantly working on things and creating things in some form or fashion. Not sure what to say exactly since I don’t know your passion, but for me that would mean writing or reading or exercising or hiking or seeing friends or catching up on movies. 

If you want to stop online gaming then you need to delete your games. Just do it for 60 days, you don’t have to do it forever. Just go without for a while and learn to live like that.

FOUR: Not sure what you mean by be more aware of the world. If you mean keep up with the news, don’t. It’s all bullshit that doesn’t affect your daily lif because the news has just become a reality show that is paid for by advertising dollars. It’s much better to narrow your focus a bit so instead of watching CNN or reading the Washington post, get more specific and read Nature if you’re interested in science or reading slashfilm if you’re interested in film or something like that. 

As for challenging yourself mentally, do this by reading books. Go to tailopez.com and look at his list of recommended books. Ignore everything else on the site but this. This is one of the greatest lists of books to read to get a full and complete understanding of the world we live in and the people who live there. 

Also check out Ryan Holidays reading list that he emails out every week or so. Really fucking great stuff. Read all of Walter Isaacsons biographies. He writes about the greatest people in history. You have a lot to learn from them. 

FIVE : Stop being passive. Go to waitbutwhy.com and read his two posts on procrastination. You’ll thank me. Also, you’re probably passive because you have fear. Gotta get rid of that if you want to live a happy life. Read the war of art by Steven pressfield and fail fast, fail often, can’t remmeber who wrote that one. Also, read Tony Robbins books, like Awaken the Giant Within. A lot of people think Tony Robbins is a scam artist or a mystical guru. Very few of those people are successful. Look at what some of the most successful people on the planet have to say about him. There’s a good reason that a lot of very smart people pay him a million dollars a year just so they can call him when they have a problem. Don’t even listen to me. Read his books. Listen to Personal Power II. Watch his documentary of Netflix. It will put a fire inside you that no one can extinguish, other than you.

Another thing is the comment u/ryan01 made called No More Zero Days (If I can find it, I'll link it.) but it's brilliant and it's a great mindset to move forward with if you've come from a background of doing nothing.

I also like the X effect for getting into a new lifestyle. There is a subreddit here that explains how it works.

But really start making little changes. Challenge yourself to cook once a week and start with mac and cheese if you have to. Pinterest new recipes. I watched a cooking challenge show to really spur my interest in cooking. 

Drive to work and listen to the radio? Not anymore. Find a good podcast. Audio book. Something like that.

Here’s a technique you can try, let me know if it works. 

For each assignment, break it down into all of its components and go from the deadline and work backwards. So let’s say there are 30 problems to do and the assignment is due in 10 days, but you want at least 2 extra days to proofread your work and go to office hours to ask questions etc. and you also wanna have Friday off so you can play video games or go on a date or just stay at home and masturbate.

So of the days you have (let’s say today’s Monday):

Day 1: #1-4
Day 2: #5-8
Day 3: ...
Day 4: Friday take it off and have some fun ;)
Day 9: proofread answers
Day 10: compare answers with other students (if that’s allowed)

Putting together this plan will help you understand where you need to be each day.

It is an environmental factor that I simply cannot fix. I would like to my mornings to be productive again but I am too tired to get up at the target time. 

I would like to hear some rules of thumb regarding my getup time. For instance, last night, he woke up at 415 and did not go back to sleep until 445 and I have to get up at 545. Would it be more beneficial in terms of energy to stay up instead of trying to get that last hour?

Generally I find if I go over 30 minutes for a nap then I'll wake up rather groggy (granted I'm woken up by an alarm), the only exception to this is if I time it for roughly 1.5 hours since I go to sleep, this way I don't wake up in middle of deep sleep cycle.

You need to figure out what your own sweet spot is but the general rule is that a REM cycle lasts 90 minutes and you don't want to get woken up in deep sleep because then you'll feel groggy for quite a while.

Aiming for 30 min naps where you can allows you to sleep but not get into the deep sleep territory

If you feel okay say at 4 45 when your baby goes back to sleep then I would say just get on with your day pretending like its 545 and you just woke up.

Even if you don't feel okay you can try to burst through that and do your best to get on with your morning as usual

Can't say much more then that, all I've heard is that when having a kid you realize how you are able to function on little sleep lol.

Probably sneak in shorter naps during your days too if you can just so you get up on your sleep quotient";2;0.6666666666666667;[[0.96280846]];[[0.66694379]];-0.1256;0.057;0.873;0.069;0.9601;0.086;0.9079999999999999;0.006;-0.092;0.024999999999999998;0.22697368421052636;-0.20197368421052636

When you get back, set a timer for how long you will engage social media.  Next, have a well defined plan on your visit?  Ask yourself why you are there, what's most important and learn to regulate yourself to those topics.  Finally, selectively engage with the audience.

Well, at least you've identified that as not very productive. Try identifying some hobby, skill, etc. that you WANT to develop, something you KNOW will improve yourself, and move your time into that (Learn to play an instrument, break dance, skateboard, start parkouring etc.) It's ok to play Dead Space II and chill for a while, but not if you can't stop seeing necromorphs and your thumbs won't stop twitching, and you go numb below the waist when you stand up. 

Science kinda suggests that fasting is good for our bodies--in the same way, it's good for your lifestyle. So if you can't control shit, maybe.. cut it out. Sometimes it's just out of your sphere of self-control, and giving it up for a time is the only way to refocus yourself. At first, you'll feel quite the void where those old habits were, but if you actively put your energy into filling that time with healthy activities, you'll be surprised at the benefits. Not to mention the extra time. It's tough but worth the tradeoff.

On a side note, it's funny how much we love things that we know are sapping our lives.

* Home = Relaxation and leisure only
* School/Campus = Study/learning/working

I did all of my work at school and on campus (library, computer lab, student center, wherever). If I had space between classes I would stay on campus and study instead of going home.

If I found I needed to do some more study after getting home I would go back out to campus. Home was for relaxation only :)

Environment plays a huge factor on our subconscious routines and habits so it helps to use it to our advantage. I think the best example of this is that at home you probably have a TV readily available. An environment where this isn't the case will only leverage your chances of staying on task for the better.

";14;"1) **Find your obstacles and know yourself** - is there anything distracting you / are you making any excuses for not studying? Is it anxiety? Example solution: put your phone and laptop in another room and just study from your textbook. 
2) **Tackle negative beliefs.** Learn MINDFULNESS. It’s about looking at your thoughts from a 3rd person perspective. It’ll help you catch yourself in the act when you’re being negative. Ignore false beliefs like ‘This will never end. I can’t do this.’ Replace them with positive thoughts like ‘I’ve gotten through exams in the past, there’s no reason why I can’t handle this.
3) **Find your why.** Why does this REALLY matter to you? Be dead honest. Is it because you always worried about money and now you need a stable salary? Is it to prove those losers in high school who bullied you that you have worth? Why are you at college? Why are you doing this? How can this particular module help you get closer to your goals? Whatever happens, your grade transcript if you do well NOW, WILL be extremely useful for your future. Forget about past grades. You’ve been growing. NOW is your time to shine. 
4) **Find some youtube vloggers/subreddits to inspire you** For example: If I didn’t watch Ibz Mo on youtube, I would have quit my degree. Look around on youtube and see if there’s anyone that inspires you. Watch them (a few videos max) during your allocated rest time in the evenings. 
5) **One step at a time** Calculate what you have to do and take it slowly. If you have 4 topics to cover and those topics have 16 subtopics, tackle 1 subtopic per hour (be realistic about how much you can do). Calculate how long it takes to do a subtopic and THEN set goals for how much time to spend per subtopic.  **KEEP A DIGITAL CLOCK (not your phone) IN FRONT OF YOU AT ALL TIMES WHEN STUDYING.** Try to use paper flash cards so that you can put your laptop/phone in the other room. Keep alternating between flash cards and past papers. Exam technique is something you know you have to tackle. 
6) **Be prepared to feel uncomfortable**. That’s the price you have to pay for getting things done. Learning is not passive like watching TV. It’s active and requires a LOT of effort. 
7) **Get your study supplies in order**. Make sure you have lots of food and water on your desk. Prep your food on Sundays. Don’t eat sugar / too many carbs because it’ll give you an energy crash and make you MORE tired. Have notepads / sticky notes / flash cards / pens / appropriate books from the library on your desk. 
8) **Where do you work best?** For me, it’s in a comfy armchair in one of the deserted living rooms, where there’s no noise. For you, it might be a coffee shop / (so you’re motivated by people studying around you and because you prefer background noise). Most people just need a comfy chair, light, fresh air and a table. 
9) **Fake it till you make it**. Don’t find the topic interesting? Pretend you like it! Pretend it’s the most interesting thing in the world and that you’re obsessed with it. Study in creative ways. Create a study comic for yourself with all the key equations. 
10) **Exercise.** It will help you retain things better.
11) **Find an equally motivated study buddy**. One that’s not distracting and has similar goals. Hold each other accountable. If you can’t find one, try FocusMate. 
12) **Rule of 3**. 8 hours sleep. 8 hours study. 8 hours other things/fun. Plan a really fun evening activity so it forces you to study. Plus, it’ll keep you sane.
13) During your 8 hours of studying, unless it’s going to the bathroom or taking a break/walk, **don’t move from your desk**. You CAN stretch but like I said keep your laptop/phone in another room. 
14) **Sleep.** Get at least 8 hours. Put your laptop / phone in a different room. If you use your phone as an alarm, plug it to an energy source on the other side of the room
15) **Don’t think ‘all or nothing’.** Life is not about being a hardcore student or a slacker. There is a balance. You CAN have a social life AND be a top student. Just remember the ‘rule of three’. If you mess up, don’t give up quickly. Be self-compassionate. You’re human and we all mess up sometimes. Equally, if you’re not keeping to your goals, recognise it and give yourself a strict kick in the ass. You can do better. You are better than this. Buck up. Just do it. 
16) **No one’s going to force you to study.** College is really about independence and acting like an adult. It’s all up to you and if you slack in the long-term, you’re going to suffer. Save yourself the drama and struggle and do things NOW while you have to power to change things. Take responsibility for your own life. 
17) Like I said, keep your phone / laptop away. No social media. No reddit. Unless it’s your 8 hours of allocated fun. **Tell anyone important that you need to focus till the exam so you can’t do X, Y, Z.** If they don’t understand, cut them out of your life. If they don’t have your best interests in mind, they’re not worth having in your life. 
18) Tbh, looking around for advice on reddit can be counterproductive because most successful people are out there DOING things. Take reddit advice with a pinch of salt. Many people can TALK about how to succeed but you need to find people who are actually DOING it. You can learn useful things on reddit but the best way to get advice is still to talk to people who are succeeding (top students) / your professors.

";14;"1. Why are you in college if you don’t want to be there? Honest question. Why are you putting yourself in massive debt for nothing? Are you paying for this yourself? Why are you going to college? What are you there to learn? Do you NEED to be there? Would it be smarter to skip college and go straight to working on your career so you’re already 4 years ahead of everyone in your class by the time they graduate? 

2. If you’re struggling with class and not going to your teacher during their office hours then you have no on to blame but yourself. Go to your teacher. Tell them you’re struggling. Either they will help you or they will help you find someone who will. ALSO, join a study group. Can’t find one? Start one. 

3. How do you get yourself to do something you don’t want to? Stop and really think about what your life is like right now. Think about the problems you’re facing. You’re biggest problem is that you are fortunate enough to be in an institution that is built to increase the computational capacity of the supercomputer that is in your head (while millions of people around the planet are currently struggling to survive so they can see the sun rise tomorrow) and you are unable to get yourself to sit down and try. It’s not that you’re trying really hard and then failing the tests. YOURE NOT EVEN TRYING. You’re scared. You’re afraid to even start studying because you’re scared it will be hard and you will fail a test. Well guess what? FUCK TESTS. Tests are not the point of college. You’re there to suck up as much knowledge as you possible can so that you will be better prepared to survive the life you choose to live (again, do you NEED to be there? 98% of people are far far far far far far FAAAAAAAAAAAR better off taking those thousands and thousands of dollars that you’re wasting on your teachers and buying a shit load of books, getting a little apartment, and reading like a mother fucker for the next 2 years. You’re not there for tests, you’re there to learn. So even if you fail your tests, it doesn’t matter, all that matters is “did you learn what you needed to learn?”  This is why good math teachers grade your work, not your answers. BECAUSE THE ANSWERS ARE IRRELEVANT. The work is all that matters. 

So here’s my advice: work. Be miserable. It’s gonna suck for just a little while because you’re so used to giving up as soon as your little brain says “oh, I don’t think I feel like studying, let me go to reddit and ask people how do I study and then wait for that little box to turn orange so I can get a dopamine hit”. How about you just study, just like that really smart kid over there in the library is doing? Think it’s easy for them? Yes! It is! Because they’ve been doing it for years. It will be easy for you too but you have to get over this difficult hump first. There is a hump in everything you want to do in life and the sooner you learn that, the better.

[NeedAdvice] Rethinking my entire life. Have no idea which direction to take.;t3_884t8q;3;"A few years ago, I was content with the thought of working online. Then, I was faced with the reality that my addictive tendencies to the internet were simply too powerful to overcome.

Around 2016, I sought medication for ADHD in the form of Adderall. I used Adderall often, but experienced heavy anxiety from certain generic types, resulting in a break.

Along with that, I also experimented with nicotine and caffeine use, and quickly learned not to mix stimulants. As of now, I am left with what I suspect is a panic disorder (although I've always had anxiety) and have been reduced to practically being a shut-in. At the time, I thought I was ""enhancing my performance in daily life."" Instead the opposite happened.

On the bright side, I start a data entry job soon.

My issue is that I want to move onto something else but have absolutely zero clue how to do so. The amount of isolation that I'm faced with daily is far from healthy, and I find myself obsessively monitoring my heart rate on my neck. It's anxiety, and generally speaking, I have no issue with mental anxiety.

When I feel it physically though, I'm fucked. Completely fucked. I **will** overthink my symptoms and get driven into having a panic attack because I perceive a threat to my wellbeing happening from within. I feel it physically, so I think it's physical.

In any event, I've arrived at a point where I can no longer use the internet like I once did, and I'm exceptionally careful with stimulants. I can't even use porn anymore without being sent into an overstimulated crash-and-burn state of being. All in all, the amount of information overload wreaks havoc on my entire mind and body, leaving me in a continual state of analysis paralysis, incapable of any sort of follow through or goal completion.

**TL;DR:** Dun goofed my entire life.";4;"Hey there, stranger! I have not experienced that kind of life to the degree that you have, but I (and probably a lot of people here) understand a little bit about what you're going through.  There is no one way to straighten yourself out. You must be always searching for methods to try on yourself. Here are a couple things you should consider:

Number 1: Diet - Are you eating plenty of vegetables and limiting your sugar intake? Chances are, you probably can improve your diet. The best thing is that it is really easy to cook a cheap and healthy meal for yourself. The benefits are so good that you will be amazed: The reward of cooking something, the good feeling of saving money, and the mental and physical improvements that build onto one another. 

Number 2: Try Your Library Out! Reading a book is a great form of entertainment with little stimulation, and being away from your computer is helping you resist the desire to browse.  Here is what you should try: go to your library and find any book that remotely seems interesting. Then read some of it, and see what you think. If you like it, keep reading! If you dont, look for another book and repeat. Give yourself an hour to find a book. The thing is, even if you don't find one, you just spent an hour focusing on one task without browsing anything. This technique really helped me realize how much clearer my thoughts are when I'm less stimulated. 

Good luck, and PM me about your experience trying this out!

[NeedAdvice] Rethinking my entire life. Have no idea which direction to take.;t3_884t8q;3;"A few years ago, I was content with the thought of working online. Then, I was faced with the reality that my addictive tendencies to the internet were simply too powerful to overcome.

Around 2016, I sought medication for ADHD in the form of Adderall. I used Adderall often, but experienced heavy anxiety from certain generic types, resulting in a break.

Along with that, I also experimented with nicotine and caffeine use, and quickly learned not to mix stimulants. As of now, I am left with what I suspect is a panic disorder (although I've always had anxiety) and have been reduced to practically being a shut-in. At the time, I thought I was ""enhancing my performance in daily life."" Instead the opposite happened.

On the bright side, I start a data entry job soon.

My issue is that I want to move onto something else but have absolutely zero clue how to do so. The amount of isolation that I'm faced with daily is far from healthy, and I find myself obsessively monitoring my heart rate on my neck. It's anxiety, and generally speaking, I have no issue with mental anxiety.

When I feel it physically though, I'm fucked. Completely fucked. I **will** overthink my symptoms and get driven into having a panic attack because I perceive a threat to my wellbeing happening from within. I feel it physically, so I think it's physical.

In any event, I've arrived at a point where I can no longer use the internet like I once did, and I'm exceptionally careful with stimulants. I can't even use porn anymore without being sent into an overstimulated crash-and-burn state of being.

**TL;DR:** Dun goofed my entire life.";4;"Your Stress System is over-worked.  Too many stress triggers in brain.

Your Rewards System is also over-worked.  Too many excitement triggers in brain.

You need more rest-relaxation triggers in your brain.  FYI, excitement is NOT rest-relaxation.

You need to collect and level **brain-emptying** good habits in order to get rid of too many stress triggers and excitement triggers, so your body and brain can relax and recover.

FYI, our brains are NOT bottomless bags and too much stuff in them (especially stress triggers) turns brains into haystacks of **needles**. 

Of the 12 good habits boldly listed in the wiki, meditation and minimalism are the top 2 when it comes to emptying the brain of stress triggers.

Personal Finance / better management of money is also great in preventing the formation of more stress triggers.

Last but THE best - the top of the line - good habit is building up **Social Capital**.  And I don't mean /r/Seduction.  More /r/SocialSkills but less about scoring with the opposite sex and being popular and way more about making and maintaining personal alliances.

Like, how's your relationships with your family?  How about with your neighbors?  Emergency funds are awesome, but pale in comparison when compared with **social network safety nets**.

I will say, 8:30-10am of every day is spent on Reddit and looking at car forums. It's a bad habit, but gets me going in the morning. I can't jump straight into work.

With that said, from 10am-5pm, I'm nailing things out 100% with very limited time surfing the web. I only use it to possibly place an Amazon order or do work related research. After I get home at 6pm, I work out, make dinner, and usually work on my car or play with my cat. 10pm bed, repeat on weekdays.

I felt like I was losing a lot of the day on my phone in past months, so I deleted Facebook from it and set it to grayscale. This has cut down on mindlessly watching Youtube and Facebook videos, which was a huge waste of time. Also scrolling over and over on your FB feed is very unproductive. I've probably gained 1-2 hours back in my day just from these changes.

I thought I'd miss playing Pokemon Go and Facebook, but after 2-3 months, I really haven't. Even keeping off Youtube has been great. Most of the videos I'd watch were clickbait. I now only use Youtube for research or learning.

In my opinion, I feel 2-3 hours max per day on non-work related internet use is a good target.

I observed something pretty interesting in myself over the last few days that I believe would be of some help for you. 

I more or less struggle with the same difficulties as you. I've got a lot of interest in certain hobbies and activities that would greatly improve my quality of life, but I've struggled to find a way to implement these activities in a productive way. Try as I may, regardless of the tactic and no matter the task, whether it's working out, studying, reading, writing, it just doesn't stick with me. I always have a couple good days before I inevitably go back to my bad habits. I always choose video games, Netflix or sleep over anything productive. 

Two nights ago, I got a speeding ticket. My second one in 5 months. I'm a college student that is hurting for money, so the first ticket put my money issues in a choke hold. This second one strangled it, as it's a mandatory court hearing and I have to get an attorney. That's about $500 I've got to come up with in a month and a half, on top of paying rent in the apartment I live in, food, utilities and gas for my car. You know the first thing I did once I got home after receiving that ticket? 

I immediately opened my computer and starting researching the charges on the ticket and what they meant. I surfed for 30 minutes on the consequences of getting a careless charge, and what steps to best follow in avoiding a canceled license. Then I started looking up and writing the phone numbers of every law firm in the city I live in. For those that allowed it, I sent them emails of my situation and my call back number so I could get a consultation. This took 1 hour. Next, I started looking up driver improvement clinics in my area, bought an online course, and finished in 4 hours, which is how long is actually takes to finish. Then I started looking for ways to make some extra money and came across the idea of donating Plasma in my blood for $50 a donation. I donated my first container yesterday morning, and I'm going back again Monday. 

All of this, in the span of two days. I was determined to get all of this stuff done, and still determined to make that $500 by literally giving my blood so I can pay for the attorney and court costs, because I literally can't pay for it otherwise with the job I have now. Yesterday while I was eating dinner, I thought about all this and was suddenly amazed at how much effort I had put into my actions. All this productivity, all this movement, and I'm still ready to keep going. How is that possible when I still struggled to stick to a workout routine? 

Then I thought about what it was that made me move in the first place. Because I got that speeding ticket, I potentially risk losing my license. If I lose my car, I can't get to work without seriously inconveniencing my roommate by asking for rides, or other friends. I risk cutting my availability in half, and thus losing money to sustain my rent and food costs. Losing money means I'll miss a payment on my rent, and be kicked out. If I get kicked out, I can't go to school, cause I'd have to go back to my parents house two hours away. It's a pretty scary situation.   

I didn't get my ass moving because I felt like it, I did it because I had to do it. Though not as serious, this was basically a life or death situation for me. Either I move, regardless of how tired I am, or risk losing everything. I think that's ultimately what it takes to get yourself moving.

[NeedAdvice] 20 year old who f***ed up. Need to decide which detour I'm taking for my life as I want to change career paths.;t3_87fde0;5;"I'm 20 a year old college student in a trade program who's graduating in &lt;2 months. I've always known that this trade wasn't going to be something I was going to stick to in the long-term and I only did it because it basically guaranteed me a job out of school. But I like it regardless and generally feel excited to come to class during lab days.  

Although with that being said I feel like I've f***ed up. I knew I should've taken something more rigorous like Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering, since I've always been a very strong math student. Just diving right into a trade as blind as I was at the time (wasting my life/attention away on videogames) without taking personal inventory of what my true strengths/interests were. ATM I want to become a web developer/programmer and I've been teaching myself via online courses. I'm almost certain that this is the kind of work I want to pursue in the long-term, and I will do anything to get my foot into the door in that industry.  

With that being said I have a few options right now. Following are what I consider pros/cons for each choice. Please tell me if anything seems out of place or if there is something you can suggest for me. One thing to note is that our household income cannot exceed &gt;$7,000 than what it is now otherwise we get less benefits. In other words, if I decide to start working, I should either make &lt;$7,000/year or break through the threshold and make as much as I can. I also receive financial aid.  

Firstly, I can get a job in my trade making ~$30,000/year starting salary and learn web development on the side. **Pros:**This would be my very first job, ever, thus giving me experience in a working environment. I can also rack up some cash to help me do some of the things that I want. **Cons:**I won't have as much time/energy to focus on learning web development; I'm basically attempting career change at 20. Job may feel pointless/depressing since it's not something I want to pursue long-term. Slow career growth in the trade. **No part-time opportunities.** Alot less free time than I would have with other options as I'm not required to work by my parents as long as I'm doing good in school and learning stuff on my own time.  

Another option is to go back to college and get a CS degree and learn web development on the side. **Pros:**Much faster progression to where I want to be as a web developer. CS degrees are slowly becoming more of a prerequisite as the field becomes more saturated. Math skills are still fresh since I've been staying in school. Still eager to go back to school and ready for the rigorous CS courses. I don't have to work until my third semester so I have plenty of time to focus on my goals. **Cons:**No job experience. Some of the courses don't really excite me since it's not all programming/math. I can't really think of any other cons. But do the pros of the other choices outweigh this option?  

There isn't a scenario where I can do both. It's either work in my trade and get money/work experience, or back to school with more focus on webdev.  

I'm just so stressed out at this point. I've spent more than 30 hours browsing the internet this past week alone trying to find information that can help me choose one or the other. The information overload is killing me mentally and it's killing my productivity. I just want to be able to settle with one choice. Sorry if this post is a mess. My mind is a f***ing mess in itself from all this browsing/decision fatigue. ";3;"First of all, calm down, and go and relax and go to sleep for a bit.

You are in your early 20s, you are still very young, there are people in the late 20s and early 30s that still don't have a career or are still in education. You should not hurry and be anxious about gaining money, but rather, you should think about long-term career progression, and job satisfaction and happiness, as long as you are actively working towards improving your life, and career, and learning, then it will not be a wasted time unlike frivolous things like playing video games/lazing around/doing vices. Both of your decisions are very reasonable, and even if they do have inherent risks, the benefits for either far outweighs the cons, it just depends on what you really think can give you the most satisfaction and contentment as a career.

Instead of thinking about making money in the short term, think about the long term, look up the long-term sustainability of the trade, how much money will you make at most? Then look up the salary and long term viability of a computer scientist, how much will they make in the future? Also, you need to consider that as you age, how much work/physical labor will you need to continue to work well?

The thing about learning web development on the side is that you will have to be extremely disciplined in making your own projects, and continually contribute to that project unto something like Github to get noticed on your resume. And no, your trade school experience won't be looked upon by recruiters when you're applying to tech companies, you will have to produce projects by yourself if you want to do that.

If you want better career opportunities in CS, then a CS degree is definitely a MUST, what a degree gives you is not an understanding of the modern technology and how to use it, but it will provide you the fundamentals of how to solve computer-related problems, paradigms of problem solving, and how to think. Even though coding is important, software development engineers spent most of their time designing and making sure that the theory/process is correct before implementing, this is why many top tech companies are tech agnostic, you can learn any popular language you want (be proficient) but they are more interested in how you think. Everyone can code, but it is harder to think of better codes and design, and that requires training and experience.

If you are taking a degree in CS, you WILL need to actively search for internships, trust me, it will help you a lot, it will pay for your tuition, probably far more monthly than what you can earn on your trade's starting monthly salary, in addition, it will give you the ability to compete for positions at top tech companies immediately after you graduate. Don't worry about not getting the best job for your first internship, get a job that INVOLVES coding, learn to solve problems and learn technology stack on the side, and learn as much from your first internship on how to talk to people in an office environment (yes, people WILL interview you on your soft skills), understand the software development processes.

You seem like a bright person if you are so confident in your math abilities, you should be able to have logic abilities as well. Again, you seem to be very driven and concerned about your future, it's a good thing, don't be afraid to try different things for the sake of improving your life, you won't regret it for trying, especially if it's something that can give you way more career-satisfaction and improve your income/lifestyle.

Quoting Frank Underwood: ""There are two kinds of pain. The sort of pain that makes you strong, or useless pain. The sort of pain that’s only suffering. I have no patience for useless things."" You will have to decide whether if you can endure the mental strain and suffering that having another few years of college education is worth your time for a possibly better career and a potentially satisfactory lifestyle or not.

There's also nothing wrong with staying in the trade as well, both path will require lots of hard work for you to succeed (Tech is not easy either), it's just whether if you believe you will be happier with one career over the other, it's a matter of what you value. In any case, don't be afraid to take the risk to improve yourself and future, especially if it is a very reasonable one (something that is not risky like gambling or buying lottery tickets), and have a better upside than downside.

Seriously, you are young, just keep calm and make a calculated decision, talk to your family about your decision, as  long as it is reasonable and you have thought it through, I think they will accept and respect your decision.

[NeedAdvice] 20 year old who f***ed up. Need to decide which detour I'm taking for my life as I want to change career paths.;t3_87fde0;5;"I'm 20 a year old college student in a trade program who's graduating in &lt;2 months. I've always known that this trade wasn't going to be something I was going to stick to in the long-term and I only did it because it basically guaranteed me a job out of school. But I like it regardless and generally feel excited to come to class during lab days.  

Although with that being said I feel like I've f***ed up. I knew I should've taken something more rigorous like Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering, since I've always been a very strong math student. Just diving right into a trade as blind as I was at the time (wasting my life/attention away on videogames) without taking personal inventory of what my true strengths/interests were. ATM I want to become a web developer/programmer and I've been teaching myself via online courses. I'm almost certain that this is the kind of work I want to pursue in the long-term, and I will do anything to get my foot into the door in that industry.  

With that being said I have a few options right now. Following are what I consider pros/cons for each choice. Please tell me if anything seems out of place or if there is something you can suggest for me. One thing to note is that our household income cannot exceed &gt;$7,000 than what it is now otherwise we get less benefits. In other words, if I decide to start working, I should either make &lt;$7,000/year or break through the threshold and make as much as I can. I also receive financial aid.  

Firstly, I can get a job in my trade making ~$30,000/year starting salary and learn web development on the side. **Pros:**This would be my very first job, ever, thus giving me experience in a working environment. I can also rack up some cash to help me do some of the things that I want. **Cons:**I won't have as much time/energy to focus on learning web development; I'm basically attempting career change at 20. Job may feel pointless/depressing since it's not something I want to pursue long-term. Slow career growth in the trade. **No part-time opportunities.** Alot less free time than I would have with other options as I'm not required to work by my parents as long as I'm doing good in school and learning stuff on my own time.  

Another option is to go back to college and get a CS degree and learn web development on the side. **Pros:**Much faster progression to where I want to be as a web developer. CS degrees are slowly becoming more of a prerequisite as the field becomes more saturated. Math skills are still fresh since I've been staying in school. Still eager to go back to school and ready for the rigorous CS courses. I don't have to work until my third semester so I have plenty of time to focus on my goals. **Cons:**No job experience. Some of the courses don't really excite me since it's not all programming/math. I can't really think of any other cons. But do the pros of the other choices outweigh this option?  

There isn't a scenario where I can do both. It's either work in my trade and get money/work experience, or back to school with more focus on webdev.  

I'm just so stressed out at this point. I've spent more than 30 hours browsing the internet this past week alone trying to find information that can help me choose one or the other. The information overload is killing me mentally and it's killing my productivity. I just want to be able to settle with one choice. Sorry if this post is a mess.

* I live a 10 minute walk from my downtown job but routinely show up 35 minutes late. However, this same routine of rushing in the morning and coming 30+ minutes late happened when I lived 40 minutes away and an hour away. Its always been this way.

* I haven't been reprimanded in any way because my work performance is generally excellent. I have been promoted and have a great relationship with senior executives.

They definitely notice and the whole thing (their judgement, my lateness) makes me very anxious and guilty. I've always felt anxious about it.

* I grew up with parents who didn't care if I stayed up late during my adolescent years, and only really cared about grades. They'd suggest I sleep but I was never forced to have a sleep schedule.

So here's how it goes, typically:

**The night before**

* Go to gym from 9 PM - 10 PM
* After coming back from the gym, shower and eat
* While eating, watch TV
* This leads me to watch more TV than I should (E.g., one episode turns into three)
* Its 11:30 PM at this point and I realize I should really head to bed as my reminders go off on my phone
* However, I think - *""I just worked out so I've earned the right to scroll through Instagram. Look how hard I worked all day at work - then I went to the gym!""*
* I take my ""deserved"" break - mindlessly scrolling through Instagram and other news sites til 12:45 AM
* Realize I'm tired and quickly wash my face
* Go to bed at 1 AM, sometimes 1:15 AM

**Morning**

* Wake up at 7 AM to say bye to my finacee as she leaves for work
* Fall back asleep, while setting an alarm for 8 AM
* Wake up at 8 AM to alarm
* Tell myself I have lots of time left before work and can sleep for another 15 mins (this happens everyday)
* Sleep in, wake up frantically at 9 AM, and realize I'm late - again
* Get ready for work in a 15 minute span - rushed shower, putting on first thing I see, and missing breakfast 
* Speed walk to work
* Arrive at 9:35 AM, when most of the office comes in between 8:30 AM - 9 AM
* Feel anxious and guilty the entire time during the walk in and until I sit on my desk

The thing is at night I am fully aware that I'm making the wrong decision to stay up late, but this whole ""I deserve this break"" thought keeps coming up in my mind. This is the same thought I get in the mornings when I'm up at 7 but tell myself I ""deserve"" extra sleep or that ""I can wake up again in 15-20 mins"", but never do.

Any suggestions would be welcome....especially from former late people who turned their schedule around.

";167;"So the first thing to notice is that you are making a set of individually reasonable choices. Of course you want some time to just browse after work and gym. And of course you don’t want to get up at 8 am if you went to bed at 1. And of course you repeat the same routine every day when there’s no consequences at work. So start with giving yourself a good reason to be early and then choose a routine that sets you up for success. 

I used to be a late nighter until I got married to a guy who goes to bed at 9 pm. When I started going to bed early and getting up early I discovered I actually loved being one of the first people at work. What nice thing could you do if you got out of the house early? A relaxed breakfast or coffee while browsing the news? A brisk but unhurried walk that lets you take in your surroundings? Getting a jump on email? Give yourself a reason to be on time (or even early!) that’s grounded in positivity rather than shame.

Then look at changing your routine. Why do you go to the gym so late especially since you’re not even having dinner beforehand? Eating late isn’t particularly healthy either. If you are working that late you should definitely not feel guilty about coming in late. But if something else could you go to gym early and have dinner early? What time does fiancée go to bed and can you make a pact to go to bed at same time? Could you get up really early and workout before work if you find nd workouts motivating? Or go at lunch time? 

And when you do find yourself getting up on time, get dressed first of all. Then browse etc. so when you notice the time you’re ready to go.

Last thing- the one job I was chronically late to, the underlying reason was that I absolutely hated the job. Make sure there isn’t some psychological reason underneath it all.

";167;"As a former late person, I became an early person because I knew my job could be on the line if I kept it up. You're pretty lucky because lateness is frowned upon on most places, even if you're a high performer. It can be looked over but still doesn't look good, even if people like you. My colleague is consistently ~15-20 minutes late and while I like him and think he's a great value to the company, I do judge him for not being able to at least show up on time. 

The way I got myself to change was by telling myself I could not leave the house any later than 7:30. If I woke up late, then I had to get ready and leave AT 7:30. This actually gave me a 15 minute cushion because I really don't need to leave until 7:45 to be on time. Since I am someone who is usually scrambling around to get my stuff together for at least five minutes before I actually leave my apartment, it has helped me to have that cushion of time in case something goes wrong or I'm just fucking up getting out the door on time. Now I'm consistently getting to work 15 minutes earlier, which has helped me anxiety and stress levels first thing in the morning tremendously.

* I grew up with parents who didn't care if I stayed up late during my adolescent years, and only really cared about grades. They'd suggest I sleep but I was never forced to have a sleep schedule.

--------------

So here's how it goes, typically:

**The night before**

* Go to gym from 9 PM - 10 PM
* After coming back from the gym, shower and eat
* While eating, watch TV
* This leads me to watch more TV than I should (E.g., one episode turns into three)
* Its 11:30 PM at this point and I realize I should really head to bed as my reminders go off on my phone
* However, I think - *""I just worked out so I've earned the right to scroll through Instagram. Look how hard I worked all day at work - then I went to the gym!""*
* I take my ""deserved"" break - mindlessly scrolling through Instagram and other news sites til 12:45 AM
* Realize I'm tired and quickly wash my face
* Go to bed at 1 AM, sometimes 1:15 AM

**Morning**

* Wake up at 7 AM to say bye to my finacee as she leaves for work
* Fall back asleep, while setting an alarm for 8 AM
* Wake up at 8 AM to alarm
* Tell myself I have lots of time left before work and can sleep for another 15 mins (this happens everyday)
* Sleep in, wake up frantically at 9 AM, and realize I'm late - again
* Get ready for work in a 15 minute span - rushed shower, putting on first thing I see, and missing breakfast 
* Speed walk to work
* Arrive at 9:35 AM, when most of the office comes in between 8:30 AM - 9 AM
* Feel anxious and guilty the entire time during the walk in and until I sit on my desk

The thing is at night I am fully aware that I'm making the wrong decision to stay up late, but this whole ""I deserve this break"" thought keeps coming up in my mind. This is the same thought I get in the mornings when I'm up at 7 but tell myself I ""deserve"" extra sleep or that ""I can wake up again in 15-20 mins"", but never do.

Any suggestions would be welcome....especially from former late people who turned their schedule around.

";167;"I think the key is to realize that you CAN arrive at work in time most days. You are instead consistently making a set of choices and choosing not to.

Let’s start with the problem and work backward.
You sleep in because you chose to go back to bed when your fiancé left.
You chose that when your fiancé left because you were tired.
You were tired because you chose not to go to bed until 1 am.
You stayed up til 1 am because you chose to browse Instagram between 11:30 and 1 am.
You did that because you chose to have a bedtime routine that includes an hour and a half of playing on your phone. 
And you started it at 11:30 because you chose to watch TV until that time.
You chose to watch TV until 11:30 because you chose to turn it on when you came home from the gym at 10.
You got home from the gym at 10 because you chose to go at 9pm.

So you have two options. You can either choose a different choice at any point along that path. Sounds like you will not commit to doing that.
Or you can decide that going to the gym requires a 3 hour recovery time after you get back, so it’s a 4 hour commitment total, and not trigger that start of a 4 hour process at 9pm. 

For example, you could choose to go to the gym at 7am instead, shower, eat breakfast, never turn on the TV or pick up the phone, and go to work at 9.

You could choose to go to the gym no later than 6pm so that you can be asleep at 10pm.

Entertainment, phones, tv are addictive for everyone, not just you. Choose not to turn them on, because you know you won’t turn them off.
Right now you are choosing to indulge that pleasant addiction instead of choosing to set yourself up to be at work on time. 

Your bosses and your girlfriend are not holding you accountable. Frankly it’s not their job to. Until you hold yourself accountable, you will not change.
You have to make the choice. ";39;0.23353293413173654;[[0.97062791]];[[0.62092211]];-0.8275;0.068;0.8440000000000001;0.08800000000000001;0.1719;0.036000000000000004;0.93;0.034;-0.021999999999999985;-0.011404421196087864;0.05014880952380952;-0.061553230719897385

";167;"First if you haven’t been diagnosed with ADHD I’d recommend looking into it. I’ve had a lifetime struggle with lateness, in particular for my first appointment of the day, and it wasn’t until I was diagnosed with ADHD that this and many other issues fell into place. 

If you have ADHD you have a completely different experience of time than people without it. Your frontal lobe, the part of the brain mostly responsible for prioritization and long-term planning, is not as functional as for most other people. One of the symptoms of this is lateness, usually because we simply lose track of time being distracted by other things (for me primarily my thoughts).

There are many techniques to help, but the greatest lesson for me was to not be as hard on myself and to do the best I can. I have also become more open with people saying I have a lateness issue, so to please bear with me.

Many people’s approach to dealing with lateness is through negative reinforcement, “just do it!”Even my father suggested, “It’s very easy, just pretend you have to catch the last train out of Germany before the Nazis show up. If you miss the train, you’re dead.”

Thanks Dad! A great way to start the day. Needless to say, the final solution is not a good solution. 

The best approach I’ve found is to have a partner you’re accountable to, someone working on the same thing. (Which is why I created a site for that). This issue with lateness has really been a focus of much of my life. Feel free to reach out!

";167;"Your post is very similar to my lifestyle!  I've always stayed up ridiculously late and have team practices until 9:30pm/10pm at night.  This is probably the blind leading the blind, but here are a few things I've implemented.  The first is I use an app called OffTime on android and I set it to start at 11 pm and turn off at 10:45 am.  It restricts usage to certain apps so I can't endlessly browse at night.  As a note, I've stopped completely clicking the Instagram explore tab to help with anxiety in general so that's been good too to avoid late night browsing.  It's a goal to be physically in bed between 11:55 pm and 12:30 am.  My fiancee also leaves the house at 7 am, but I don't wake up until 8 am.  I've started using an app called Alarmy.  The first alarm is set at 8:05 am with difficult math problems that need to be completed before it shuts off.  Chug some water that I set out the night before.  The second alarm is set for 8:15 am and I need to take a picture of a barcode to shut it off.  The barcode is set the night before of a comic book so I need to get out of bed to snap the picture.  Since the comic book is already in hand, I spend 15 or so mins reading it cause it's nice to have some joy before work.  The next 20 mins are spent getting ready and eating breakfast.  If all goes well, I'm out the door by 8:50 am.
 
 
One of the biggest eye openers I've read is that people sometimes don't understand how long it actually takes them to get out the door or how long it takes for them to do certain things like eat or get ready.  A suggestion is to time yourself from when you wake up to when you are physically out the door.  Add ten minutes.  That's how long you need to get ready in the morning.  I used to be perpetually late to team trainings at night.  It's gotten way better now that I've added the ten-minute buffer to get in my car.  Instead of leaving the house at 6:40 pm, I now START to leave the house at 6:30 pm.  It's gotten me to be physically in my car by 6:40 which gets there on time.";7;0.041916167664670656;[[0.96478446]];[[0.67191584]];-0.8275;0.068;0.8440000000000001;0.08800000000000001;0.9717;0.107;0.826;0.068;-0.058999999999999976;-0.011404421196087864;0.051530612244897946;-0.0629350334409858

* Wake up at 7 AM to say bye to my finacee as she leaves for work
* Fall back asleep, while setting an alarm for 8 AM
* Wake up at 8 AM to alarm
* Tell myself I have lots of time left before work and can sleep for another 15 mins (this happens everyday)
* Sleep in, wake up frantically at 9 AM, and realize I'm late - again
* Get ready for work in a 15 minute span - rushed shower, putting on first thing I see, and missing breakfast 
* Speed walk to work
* Arrive at 9:35 AM, when most of the office comes in between 8:30 AM - 9 AM
* Feel anxious and guilty the entire time during the walk in and until I sit on my desk

The thing is at night I am fully aware that I'm making the wrong decision to stay up late, but this whole ""I deserve this break"" thought keeps coming up in my mind. This is the same thought I get in the mornings when I'm up at 7 but tell myself I ""deserve"" extra sleep or that ""I can wake up again in 15-20 mins"", but never do.

Any suggestions would be welcome....especially from former late people who turned their schedule around.

";167;"If you just stayed up at 7 when you say bye to your fiancé and started your day then you’d have an extra 2 hours! Have her set an alarm on your phone when she leaves, have her put it far away from the bed and then you’ll be forced to get up and then it’s just willpower to not get back in bed.

Tips for not getting back in bed:
Pound a cup of coffee/water/any liquid right when you wake up.
Get right in the shower when you get up out of bed.
Start working out in the morning if you can, huge energy boost in the morning and you won’t take up as much time at night, you’ll be more tired and night and you’ll sleep better.

Just gotta work on that willpower it seems like, best of luck!

Edit: also it doesn’t seem like a big deal, showing up to work 30 minutes late doesn’t even seem like an issue for you or any of your superiors.

With you though. In my opinion, you need to get to sleep earlier Maybe try waking up at 630.  You May even benefit from going to sleep super early and hitting the gym before work. That way instead of wasting your pump at night staying up going on Instagram and you should be sleeping you can use it for work. I'm the last thing you got to do is just remember how much more pleasant it is to take your time getting to work and not forget anything in a rush. Just make yourself leave earlier than you want to and the whole time just remember how much more pleasant the trip and the start of your day is because of it

";167;"On a practical level, the Moment app can help you put an end to that late night instagram scrolling. Another tip I learned is to schedule your recreation like you schedule your work. Having fun things to do at a specified time can keep you focused in work mode when you need to be. 

On a deeper level, are you late to things that excite you? Whether it’s a hot date, or an awesome concert, or a meaningful yoga class, think about things that you aren’t late to. What is the difference in the process? For me, if I’m looking forward to something, I skip everything that doesn’t matter beforehand so I can be on time. If I don’t want to be there or I feel ambivalent, suddenly time wasters seem really fun and engaging. 

If you take a step back and assess your career, are you enjoying it? Do you like where you are, or at least get excited about the potential for advancement in your job? If not, you’ll have to work harder to remind yourself why you want to be there every day. And in the long run, you may want to make some changes so you can have a job you look forward to starting every morning. 

I had a job I hated. I felt stuck there. A half hour late turned into two hours late some days, and still no consequences, just a stern talking to. When I eventually got fired, I was so happy, and it was only then that I realized how unhappy I had been. I wish I had given it more thought sooner, before I wasted years of potential doing something I didn’t love.

They definitely notice and the whole thing (their judgement, my lateness) makes me very anxious and guilty. I've always felt anxious about it.

* My lateness was a thing before I ever stepped foot in the corporate world. I am a notorious procrastinator and was always 10-30 mins late to classes in university as well and generally always skipped my morning classes.  I had above average grades in University and didn't suffer any consequences. Same thing in high school - routinely late for classes, or rushing to the point of exhaustion, but no consequences as my grades were great.

* I grew up with parents who didn't care if I stayed up late during my adolescent years, and only really cared about grades. They'd suggest I sleep but I was never forced to have a sleep schedule.

So here's how it goes, typically:

**The night before**

* Go to gym from 9 PM - 10 PM
* After coming back from the gym, shower and eat
* While eating, watch TV
* This leads me to watch more TV than I should (E.g., one episode turns into three)
* Its 11:30 PM at this point and I realize I should really head to bed as my reminders go off on my phone
* However, I think - *""I just worked out so I've earned the right to scroll through Instagram. Look how hard I worked all day at work - then I went to the gym!""*
* I take my ""deserved"" break - mindlessly scrolling through Instagram and other news sites til 12:45 AM
* Realize I'm tired and quickly wash my face
* Go to bed at 1 AM, sometimes 1:15 AM

**Morning**

* Wake up at 7 AM to say bye to my finacee as she leaves for work
* Fall back asleep, while setting an alarm for 8 AM
* Wake up at 8 AM to alarm
* Tell myself I have lots of time left before work and can sleep for another 15 mins (this happens everyday)
* Sleep in, wake up frantically at 9 AM, and realize I'm late - again
* Get ready for work in a 15 minute span - rushed shower, putting on first thing I see, and missing breakfast 
* Speed walk to work
* Arrive at 9:35 AM, when most of the office comes in between 8:30 AM - 9 AM
* Feel anxious and guilty the entire time during the walk in and until I sit on my desk

The thing is at night I am fully aware that I'm making the wrong decision to stay up late, but this whole ""I deserve this break"" thought keeps coming up in my mind. This is the same thought I get in the mornings when I'm up at 7 but tell myself I ""deserve"" extra sleep or that ""I can wake up again in 15-20 mins"", but never do.

Any suggestions would be welcome....especially from former late people who turned their schedule around.

";167;Perhaps I am not the best person to advise you on this, as i have sleeping trouble myself, but consider this. You have continually stayed up late even though you tell yourself you dont want to, but you have enough control over your actions to work out regularly and keep a daily schedule. Perhaps the problem is that the reasoning you give yourself as to why you want to wake up early isnt a good enough reason. You arent getting reprimanded, so there arent any obvious consequences for sleeping late, and other than feeling anxious walking into work late, there are no tangible negatives to your lateness. You need to actually figure out why you want to get to work on time, and that reasoning needs to be convincing enough when you face that decision tired and lazy at 11:30pm. If you cannot find a good enough reason to sleep in early, then make one. Tell your fiancee to hold you accountable on something you care about if you sleep late that day. Make tangible consequences for yourself and you will be more inclined to avoid those consequences.;2;0.011976047904191616;[[0.95900188]];[[0.44458181]];-0.8275;0.068;0.8440000000000001;0.08800000000000001;-0.9628;0.046;0.795;0.159;0.093;-0.011404421196087864;0.04895833333333332;-0.060362754529421185

";167;"I'm sort of chronically late myself, but only by about 2-5 minutes... and when I'm not late I'm generally just on time. I've tried many different techniques but one that works is using a reminder app to set a lot of alarms for myself and - this is just as important - with different snooze options. 

For instance, in the evening I set a reminder for 1 1/2 hours before bed, with 30 mins snooze intervals. And I have different reminders depending on when I have regular activities that l know will make me late home and to bed. So most days my reminder will be set for 20:30 with the ideal aim of bedtime at 22:00 but when I have later activities the reminder is set for 22:30 and the ideal bedtime is as soon as I can make it. 

I do something similar with reminders in the morning. I like having breakfast in bed before getting ready so I have a reminder for about 10 mins before I have to get up with a snooze interval of 5 mins to ease me into it. And I do the same thing when I have to be out the door - I set a reminder for about 10-15 mins before I have to walk out. With a 5 min snooze. It keeps me focused and makes me aware of time in a completely different way. 

I also know when I *have* to be out the door in order to make it to work, and that usually works as a final irreversible deadline. Getting closer to this time should probably be the first thing you aim for rather than going to bed earlier, if you're like me the other way around won't really work. 

Like you I tend to reward myself with browsing etc in the evening, but I try to do it in bed after I'm completely ready to go to sleep. That makes the barrier easier to cross when I decide (realise 😂) that I need to sleep NOW.

";167;"I believe the issue is your second bullet. You do it because you know you can get away with it. I’ll guarantee you this much, despite the fact that you get away with it, your boss, your coworkers all notice it. And while it hasn’t impacted your career goals, you are setting yourself up for a fall if there’s a change of management at your company. So, what steps do you take? Commit to one day this week getting to work on time. Do whatever it takes to get there. Went to bed at 1 am? Too bad, you still have to get up. Expand this to two days, then three, etc.  Forcing yourself to get up will eventually cure your late night habit. But until you decide that its worth doing, even if you don’t get in trouble you won’t be successful.

";167;"As someone that was always late I can relate. At a former employer there were days I showed up at 11 but worked till 9-10 PM so got away with it. The only way for me to change was to push myself totally to the other side. Like the comment by onthewingsofangel dating someone who is a morning person helped. My girlfriend starts her day at 4:30 and I usually start by 5:30 myself now. Now I can get to work by 8:30 despite an hour commute.

That being said, there were some critical changes I had to make 
1) I had to give myself a reason to wake up in the morning. Is there a reason you can’t go to the gym in the morning instead of the evening. It’ll help not get you charged up late at night, and you’ll have a reason to get up. Hell make it a routine to have morning sex if that’s what helps you get out of bed (Me and my partner did for a bit).
2) don’t set incremental goals. For the longest time I tried to get up 15 mins early and kept falling back into the same routine. I had to give myself a jolt to wake up at 5:30 instead of 8:15 so that my body couldn’t just use another 15 mins as an excuse. 
3) get off your bed as soon as your alarm goes off. Whether you do this by putting your alarm away from your bed (so that you have to get up) but make sure you at least get up.
4) have some water and brush your teeth. Initially when I did this; I would go back and crash on the bed. What changed it for me was making sure I get up, drink some water and brush my teeth. Just being awake through those things made me not crash back.

All the best with your efforts; the results on the other side are totally worth it.";2;0.011976047904191616;[[0.97958712]];[[0.65789439]];-0.8275;0.068;0.8440000000000001;0.08800000000000001;0.3564;0.08;0.85;0.07;-0.02999999999999998;-0.011404421196087864;0.04523809523809524;-0.0566425164341831

The thing is at night I am fully aware that I'm making the wrong decision to stay up late, but this whole ""I deserve this break"" thought keeps coming up in my mind. This is the same thought I get in the mornings when I'm up at 7 but tell myself I ""deserve"" extra sleep or that ""I can wake up again in 15-20 mins"", but never do.

Any suggestions would be welcome....especially from former late people who turned their schedule around.

";167;"Discipline is great for hard things. You don't need discipline for this. There are benefits to you living your life this way, the cost ends up being that you're late. If that cost is less than the benefit, then you behave exactly as you do, while fooling yourself that actually you want things different. Nope, you don't. 

It doesn't even matter (you think at least) that you're late because as you said, you have great relationships and it's never put your job at risk. 
If they told you to show up on time or you're fired on the spot, would you? I bet you would.

So you need to shift your perspective and add emotional weight to being late. Don't make it about anyone other than you. Stop focusing on the effects out there in the world and focus on the effects in your psychology. 

Every time you do it, what's the story you're writing about yourself? 
I want you to sit down with a journal, alone, and write tomorrow's date and your name. Write ""(your name) will be late for work, because ..) and write down all the reasons. Late, undisciplined, lazy etc. Those are excuses.  They will feel bad but not bad enough to make you stop. They're how you justify your behavior and aren't even real.

Write another one and change the date to 1, 5, or 10 years from now, but have it say the same thing: you're still running late all the time. Consider something very carefully: if this comes true, what kind of person will you have been come the end of your life, and will you, looking back on your life like a series of journal entries, be happy with who you were?

You might think about that and seriously not care. If that's the case, scratch out the excuses and stop using them because you're not lazy, undisciplined, etc, you just don't care to be on time. Start saying that and owning that that's just you, people will respect you for it because it's honest and they already know that about you anyway.

Or, it'll be deeply painful. You'll want to cry at how desolate and empty it feels to waste your life that way. Not because of any reason other than because it's not who you want to be. If that's the case, start a new journal entry with tomorrow's date. Re-write your future, have it say something different. ""Today I was on time.""

Do this daily. At night it will be easy to think of yourself getting to work on time in the morning. In the morning it will be difficult because you haven't emotionally connected with the 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 year later vision of you never having put in the effort to be on time.

This is how I do it. I remind myself that time is one of the few things that's running out that we can never get back.  That makes it just about the most expensive, previous, and valuable things on the planet that you can ever have or be given by someone else. So I remind myself of that, that when I'm 5 minutes late for someone who waited for me, that's 5 minutes they'll never get back, and they could've had 5 extra minutes with their kids or whatever is most important to them instead. And instead, I made them wait, and they deemed me worth waiting for. That's a huge responsibility that shouldn't be taken lightly or for granted. That makes me on time because it means something to me.


So instead of snoozing, imagine that for two minutes. Looking back on your life and remembering this exact day when you had an opportunity to live your life up to your own expectations and chose not to. 
Then get out of bed and be on time.

";167;"This was me EXACTLY at the end of last year.  I did everything you are talking about.... more than just 1 episode, ""earning"" phone scrolling time that turns into hours, guilty feeling but continued behavior.  Here's what I did to fix it, as it was/is my New Year's resolution.

1)  Remove temptations you cannot resist.  For me, this was deleting social media off my phone bc I had no self control.  It's been the best decision I've made so far.  I check social media periodically throughout the day on my work comp and that's it.  If you can't delete it, install an app time limiter on your phone or add parental restrictions.  My TV's are on smart switches that are on a schedule that turns off all TV's after dark, as to not allow blue light to keep me up.

2)  Established a better bed routine.  I bought GE C-Sleep light bulbs, which are dimmable, white light color adjusting, and programmable.  I set them to dim and filter out blue light once the sun goes down.  An hour out from bed time, they start dimming down slowly so I know I have to get into bed.  I also have them programmed to turn on slowly, over a 30 min period, in the am.  This wakes me up slowly and naturally and the morning light is full of blue light which tricks the body into waking up.  I also use the sleep cycle app to wake me up during a natural part of my sleep cycle.  I then have an old school bell alarm on the first floor (I have an open loft) that I have to walk down and turn off.  This alarm is set to the absolute latest I'm allowed to sleep in, so when I turn this off I know I can't get back in bed.  Next to this alarm I keep a big water bottle that I fill with ice the night before.  The ice melts over night and the water is decently cold still in the morning, which is the best way I have found to shock my body into awake mode.  Otherwise, half asleep me will rationalize getting back in bed.  

3)  Outsource/others holding you accountable.  My SO gets up before me as well, so I ask him to talk to me while he gets ready and/or make as much noise as possible.  We also have a routine where he will scratch my back as he waits for the train, but only if I'm talking to him.  This way, I naturally want to wake up and don't fight to go back to sleep without realizing.  It might sound stupid, but my half asleep mind is tricked by this lol.  If I'm completely out and not responding, he throws some water on me lol.  My parents had to do that to me when I was little a lot.  

Also, find someone to hold you accountable.  This is the second most important tactic for me.  Tell a coworker your goals and have him/her hold you accountable.  For example, for every minute I'm late to work, I give my coworker a quarter.  Why a quarter? Bc it's annoying af to go to the bank/store and get quarters.  After a couple of times having to hand over quarters, being on time became more of a priority bc I want to avoid the hassle of dealing with fucking quarters!  or you can schedule meetings 15 min after you are supposed to arrive.  Just make it so that their is an immediate and very annoying consequence to being late and don't be afraid to ask for help if you can't stick to imposing consequences on yourself.  That is the key to retraining yourself.  

Right now you don't hold see being on time as a high priority bc you have never noticed negative consequences for being late.  It's a learned behavior.  And you will have to unlearn it.  Make sure there is an IMMEDIATE and ANNOYING consequence for being late, staying up to late,  etc. Be patient with yourself but don't stop holding yourself accountable.

";167;"So I didn't  have the patience  to read through all of the many comments  herr, but the ones I did read seemed really helpful in terms of practical scheduling etc. One thing I wanted to add (or repeat,  if someone  else beat me to it) is that right now,  it sounds  like arriving at work is pretty unpleasant.  You are late and guilty and have to walk past all those assistants feeling ashamed. It's  no wonder that you want to put off that experience! 

This will naturally resolve when you start to arrive on time, but  in the meantime to help your efforts, recognize that you do a great job regardless  of what time you  come in and that it's  normal to have a few imperfections. Instead of slinking by feeling guilty for being late, try swaggering in feeling great about being good at your job, be friendly with the people who see you walk in, and  don't  let yourself be bogged down by guilt over a few minutes of the day. If you can make arriving at work a good part of your day, then it will be a lot easier to follow through on getting there on time.

Also, I was chronically late to everything until I attended a college with a very strict tardiness  policy where being more than 15 minutes late four time resulted in automatic failure of the class. At the beginning  of the semester  I would write up my schedule with everything  a half hour earlier than I really needed to be there, and I brought  a book with me in case I ever actually  made it ""on time "" this way getting there quickly was a nice little treat, and if I ran behind it wasn't a big deal.

I now automatically  aim to arrive places 1/2 hour before I actually  need to be there and I can say it's  saved my butt plenty of times.

";167;"Although there are many comments telling you to go to the gym in the morning, I found this to be too drastic of a change for me.

I don't like leaving the house, working out, getting sweaty, and showering and getting ready for work at the gym.  Granted, I'm female, so there is more cosmetic stuff involved, and packing my go-to-work clothes, instead of just gym clothes, so, going to the gym before work is more time-consuming than going AFTER work, because after work means I can jet out of there and come home for my evening routine, not caring about changing. Just clean up and get out of there.

So -- what are you doing with your time between leaving work and going to the gym at night?

Let's say you get home at 6:00 pm or so -- you've not accounted for what you doing between 6:00 pm and 9:00 pm  -- that's a three hour gap.   

Start by changing ONE thing in your routine -- and not something completely drastic.  Just gently shift everything by going to the gym as soon as you are OFF work.

You said working out makes you tired, and so would eating, right?

I'll bet if you leave work, go the gym, and then come home and eat food, you've shifted everything in your schedule UP  a few hours, including being able to go to bed at the same time as your fiance.

If so, make love, and get MORE tired, and this puts you sleep well before midnight.  That means you'll be more alert with her alarm goes off the next morning, and so on.

Just try one thing, first, and not something so drastic as working out at night changed to working out in the a.m.   I'd start by going to the gym immediately after work, and then making dinner immediately after that, and then working up to going to bed with your fiance, and sooner or later, your night schedule will be more restful.";2;0.011976047904191616;[[0.9664127]];[[0.54641953]];-0.8275;0.068;0.8440000000000001;0.08800000000000001;0.8608;0.064;0.895;0.04;-0.04399999999999999;-0.011404421196087864;0.2096371882086168;-0.22104160940470466

";167;"Oh I can relate. Last semester, I had a 7AM class 3 hour-long and everyday I'd be going in around 8AM. Even though my house it just a 15 minute drive away from my college. My instructor always gives me 1% for the attendance. I almost failed because of this. So I decided to change it. 

I mostly go to sleep by 1AM, when I have a quiz or test, 4:30AM. But now I go to sleep by 11PM. I try to get everything done by 10:30PM just so I have a me-time for 30 minutes.

 I set my alarm for 5:45AM and I put the clock 2-3 meters away from my bed just so I will have to get up and snooze it. That way I'm basically up. Then I go back to sleeping but the alarm's nosiy again so I will have to get up and snooze it again. It goes on and on until I am finally fully awake by 6:10AM. (Imagine 30 minutes of trying to be asleep, alarm goes off, you have to get up, you're just gonna get tired from all this lol)

Eat breakfast until 6:20AM. Shower and brush my teeth until 6:35AM. Get dressed and I'm out by 6:40AM. So I'll be in school by 6:55AM. I know it's not so early, but at least gives me a 5-minute window just to prepare for the class. 

You should try the far from you alarm clock. It worked for me.

";167;"This is probably going to sound like bullshit, but it worked for me.  It seems like you are in generally a better place than I was with your excellent work performance (mine was erratically veering between excellent and thoughtless), but I hope this helps you anyway.

At one point in my life I was tired of being the person who couldn’t be relied upon (this is not your problem, but stay with me).  I realized that I saw myself as an absentminded genius, not a competent reliable person.  So I sabotaged myself - one of the ways Ibdid this was to consistently be late for work.  I set myself up for failure - or a difficult time at least - and had to pull things out of a hat to keep my area running.  It was a much more exciting way of looking at myself and work in general.  But it was stressful and it made me feel bad because I eventually realized people I worked with, liked, and admired didn’t see me as interesting and excitingly flying by the seat of my pants - they saw me as a pain in the ass a lot of the time.  I had the benefit of observing a work friend behave the way I did and realizing that she was viewed negatively, even though she felt she was constantly pulling her ass out if the fire with brilliant results.  She wasn’t and it was obvious to everyone else but her.  I had to face the fact that I was the same or worse.  

So what did I do?  I realized the first, and maybe most important thing, at least in the eyes of others, was to be at work on time.  I tallied up my average commute from my door to my desk, added 15 minutes in case of subway delays, subtracted that from 9:00 am and committed to leaving at that time every day, no matter what.  I also added up the time I spent in the morning, added half an hour for breakfast ( which I didn’t bother with previously) and to read or do something I enjoyed each morning, so the early part of my day had something to look forward to.  And I subtracted that amount of time from the time I had committed to leave each morning.  And every day I set my alarm for that time exactly - no fudging a little so I could keep hitting the snooze button - no matter what time I went to bed - and I am a night owl.  

To my surprise, I started showing up at work 15 to 20 minutes early.  My commute was easier because I was now leaving at just before the peak rush, so I gained even more time than I anticipated.  And to my surprise I found I loved getting in before everyone else.  I could ease into my day, and greet everyone as they came in, and amusingly take a lofty view of all the people who came sneaking in way after 9:00 am every day, either trying to pretend that they were not late, or frantically calling attention to their whirlwind efforts to catch up with their day.  Over the next year, I gained new respect from my colleagues, ebjoyed myself much much more, surprisingly, felt LESS tired than when I hit snooze 4 times every morning (there is something to be said for consistency - though I still sleep late on weekends), and actually lost 20 pounds to return to my skinny high school weight - who knew eating breakfast would keep me from starving all morning and vacuuming in food the rest of the day!

The real key for me was identifying what time I had to leave each morning and what time I had to get up, building in extra time to spare in my estimates.  And then NOT HITTING SNOOZE - it was a point of pride for me that I COULD control the way I related to time and the benefits soon made getting up immediately an easily ingrained habit.

I hope some of what I’ve said strikes a chord, and/or seems do-able.  As I said, it already sounds like you are better off than I was, so maybe it will be even easier for you.  Good luck, in any case.";2;0.011976047904191616;[[0.97579734]];[[0.59797138]];-0.8275;0.068;0.8440000000000001;0.08800000000000001;0.9976;0.18600000000000003;0.7190000000000001;0.095;-0.111;-0.011404421196087864;0.13619146005509644;-0.1475958812511843

";167;"based on my experience:
- never miss breakfast, this mess up your whole daily eating routine
- late gym - if you are following a quite normal sleep cycle, the hours between 10pm and 12pm are the best time to go to sleep. Instead, you are stressing your body with a training and also a late dinner after that are a guarantee for a bad quality sleep. So may be try to move your gym in the morning. 
- give yourself at least 8 hours of bed time. Sleeping from 1am to 7am are only 6 hours, which are hardly enough given the fact that you are at work the whole day and also working out. Just try for a couple of days to go to bed earlier and track how many hours you need, so you can wake up more easily - something in the range of 7.5 to 8.5 hours should be enough, but do not take advantage of the earlier bed time and oversleeping for 9+ hours.

that's just my opinion, i'm also working out after work 8-10pm and tracking my sleep of those days, i never get more than 1 hour of deep sleep and on the other day usually feel tired, so I try to compensate with coffees, which is not good (:";1;0.005988023952095808;[[0.96601418]];[[0.57113509]];-0.8275;0.068;0.8440000000000001;0.08800000000000001;-0.902;0.033;0.883;0.084;0.031000000000000014;-0.011404421196087864;0.023333333333333338;-0.034737754529421204

* This leads me to watch more TV than I should (E.g., one episode turns into three)
* Its 11:30 PM at this point and I realize I should really head to bed as my reminders go off on my phone
* However, I think - *""I just worked out so I've earned the right to scroll through Instagram. Look how hard I worked all day at work - then I went to the gym!""*
* I take my ""deserved"" break - mindlessly scrolling through Instagram and other news sites til 12:45 AM
* Realize I'm tired and quickly wash my face
* Go to bed at 1 AM, sometimes 1:15 AM

**Morning**

* Wake up at 7 AM to say bye to my finacee as she leaves for work
* Fall back asleep, while setting an alarm for 8 AM
* Wake up at 8 AM to alarm
* Tell myself I have lots of time left before work and can sleep for another 15 mins (this happens everyday)
* Sleep in, wake up frantically at 9 AM, and realize I'm late - again
* Get ready for work in a 15 minute span - rushed shower, putting on first thing I see, and missing breakfast 
* Speed walk to work
* Arrive at 9:35 AM, when most of the office comes in between 8:30 AM - 9 AM
* Feel anxious and guilty the entire time during the walk in and until I sit on my desk

The thing is at night I am fully aware that I'm making the wrong decision to stay up late, but this whole ""I deserve this break"" thought keeps coming up in my mind.

";167;I used to deal with this problem, and my solution might sound weird but it works for me. Basically I just delude myself and tell myself that I need to get somewhere 30 min before I actually have to be there. Eg. if i have a meeting at 9:30am, I keep telling myself that my meeting is at 9 - that way in the morning, I am trying to leave by 8:30, and even if I am late (which happens to me often), I still get to the office on time! ;1;0.005988023952095808;[[0.95815627]];[[0.5326614]];-0.8275;0.068;0.8440000000000001;0.08800000000000001;-0.3301;0.02;0.919;0.061;0.021000000000000005;-0.011404421196087864;-0.11875;0.10734557880391213

* I live a 10 minute walk from my downtown job but routinely show up 35 minutes late. However, this same routine of rushing in the morning and coming 30+ minutes late happened when I lived 40 minutes away and an hour away. Its always been this way.

* I haven't been reprimanded in any way because my work performance is generally excellent. I have been promoted and have a great relationship with senior executives.

* My lateness was a thing before I ever stepped foot in the corporate world. I am a notorious procrastinator and was always 10-30 mins late to classes in university as well and generally always skipped my morning classes.  I had above average grades in University and didn't suffer any consequences. Same thing in high school - routinely late for classes, or rushing to the point of exhaustion, but no consequences as my grades were great.

* I grew up with parents who didn't care if I stayed up late during my adolescent years, and only really cared about grades. They'd suggest I sleep but I was never forced to have a sleep schedule.

";167;"This was me. Well, it's still me. I've resigned that I am not meant to be an employee. The reason why I was late to work was because I knew that my job didn't really matter. I felt like it didn't really MATTER to ANYONE if I was on time or not. The only reason it matter was because the corporation needed parameters with which to measure outcomes and pay employees.

As an entrepreneur, I am never ever as late to client appointments or meetings as I was to my job. Sometimes I'd even be early. What's the difference? Because as an entrepreneur it MATTERS. It MATTERS that I am on time because my schedule is booked. or this person will NOT do business with me if I'm late. And if I am late, maybe we can still have a good relationship to where we like each other enough to do business despite tardiness.

When you find a reason that matters to you to be on time, you will start being more on time. I noticed in the comments some people became on time because keeping their job really mattered to them.

* Go to bed at 1 AM, sometimes 1:15 AM

**Morning**

* Wake up at 7 AM to say bye to my finacee as she leaves for work
* Fall back asleep, while setting an alarm for 8 AM
* Wake up at 8 AM to alarm
* Tell myself I have lots of time left before work and can sleep for another 15 mins (this happens everyday)
* Sleep in, wake up frantically at 9 AM, and realize I'm late - again
* Get ready for work in a 15 minute span - rushed shower, putting on first thing I see, and missing breakfast 
* Speed walk to work
* Arrive at 9:35 AM, when most of the office comes in between 8:30 AM - 9 AM
* Feel anxious and guilty the entire time during the walk in and until I sit on my desk

The thing is at night I am fully aware that I'm making the wrong decision to stay up late, but this whole ""I deserve this break"" thought keeps coming up in my mind. This is the same thought I get in the mornings when I'm up at 7 but tell myself I ""deserve"" extra sleep or that ""I can wake up again in 15-20 mins"", but never do.

* I live a 10 minute walk from my downtown job but routinely show up 35 minutes late. However, this same routine of rushing in the morning and coming 30+ minutes late happened when I lived 40 minutes away and an hour away. Its always been this way.

* I haven't been reprimanded in any way because my work performance is generally excellent. I have been promoted and have a great relationship with senior executives.

* My lateness was a thing before I ever stepped foot in the corporate world. I am a notorious procrastinator and was always 10-30 mins late to classes in university as well and generally always skipped my morning classes.  I had above average grades in University and didn't suffer any consequences. Same thing in high school - routinely late for classes, or rushing to the point of exhaustion, but no consequences as my grades were great.

* I grew up with parents who didn't care if I stayed up late during my adolescent years, and only really cared about grades. They'd suggest I sleep but I was never forced to have a sleep schedule.

";167;"I scrolled for a while, and I didn't see your ""deserve"" concern mentioned, so I thought I'd give you my two cents. That concern resonates with me because a lot of my relatives use that reasoning when deciding to have that cookie, or extra piece of cake. As a result, several of them are overweight and unhealthy. Rewarding yourself in the short-term is not always a real reward, but our brains are wired to think that way because they're still adapted to the Stone Age, and not our society where delayed gratification can actually be helpful. The way I think about it is that I owe my present self and future self love, kindness, and care; also, because our brains have a tendency towards immediate gratification I try to err on the side of taking care of future picclo. I got this idea from a marvelous bestof Reddit post several years ago. There was also a New York Times article recently about how activities engendering feelings of pride and gratitude are helpful in avoiding inmediate gratification when it is more helpful to work towards long-term goals.

* Its 11:30 PM at this point and I realize I should really head to bed as my reminders go off on my phone
* However, I think - *""I just worked out so I've earned the right to scroll through Instagram. Look how hard I worked all day at work - then I went to the gym!""*
* I take my ""deserved"" break - mindlessly scrolling through Instagram and other news sites til 12:45 AM
* Realize I'm tired and quickly wash my face
* Go to bed at 1 AM, sometimes 1:15 AM

**Morning**

* Wake up at 7 AM to say bye to my finacee as she leaves for work
* Fall back asleep, while setting an alarm for 8 AM
* Wake up at 8 AM to alarm
* Tell myself I have lots of time left before work and can sleep for another 15 mins (this happens everyday)
* Sleep in, wake up frantically at 9 AM, and realize I'm late - again
* Get ready for work in a 15 minute span - rushed shower, putting on first thing I see, and missing breakfast 
* Speed walk to work
* Arrive at 9:35 AM, when most of the office comes in between 8:30 AM - 9 AM
* Feel anxious and guilty the entire time during the walk in and until I sit on my desk

The thing is at night I am fully aware that I'm making the wrong decision to stay up late, but this whole ""I deserve this break"" thought keeps coming up in my mind. This is the same thought I get in the mornings when I'm up at 7 but tell myself I ""deserve"" extra sleep or that ""I can wake up again in 15-20 mins"", but never do.

Any suggestions would be welcome....especially from former late people who turned their schedule around.

";167;"1) Using your work email system, write an email to your fiance, telling her that you've just been thinking about how you want to show her your appreciation for everything she does, so you'll take over a chore at home (that you hate and that she does) for the next month.

2) Set it to send at 9 am the following day.

3) Don't forget to cancel it and reschedule for the following day when you get in.

4) If you have a real problem and actually miss it, well then, you did something nice for your fiance.

[NeedAdvice] I can't arrive on time to work. Ever.;t3_837dcl;48;"**Context:** 

* I live a 10 minute walk from my downtown job but routinely show up 35 minutes late. However, this same routine of rushing in the morning and coming 30+ minutes late happened when I lived 40 minutes away and an hour away. Its always been this way.

* I haven't been reprimanded in any way because my work performance is generally excellent. I have been promoted and have a great relationship with senior executives. The people that see me walk in 35 mins late every day are the assistants to these executives. They definitely notice and the whole thing (their judgement, my lateness) makes me very anxious and guilty. I've always felt anxious about it.

* My lateness was a thing before I ever stepped foot in the corporate world. I am a notorious procrastinator and was always 10-30 mins late to classes in university as well and generally always skipped my morning classes.  I had above average grades in University and didn't suffer any consequences. Same thing in high school - routinely late for classes, or rushing to the point of exhaustion, but no consequences as my grades were great.

* I grew up with parents who didn't care if I stayed up late during my adolescent years, and only really cared about grades. They'd suggest I sleep but I was never forced to have a sleep schedule.

--------------

So here's how it goes, typically:

**The night before**

* Go to gym from 9 PM - 10 PM
* After coming back from the gym, shower and eat
* While eating, watch TV
* This leads me to watch more TV than I should (E.g., one episode turns into three)
* Its 11:30 PM at this point and I realize I should really head to bed as my reminders go off on my phone
* However, I think - *""I just worked out so I've earned the right to scroll through Instagram. Look how hard I worked all day at work - then I went to the gym!""*
* I take my ""deserved"" break - mindlessly scrolling through Instagram and other news sites til 12:45 AM
* Realize I'm tired and quickly wash my face
* Go to bed at 1 AM, sometimes 1:15 AM

**Morning**

* Wake up at 7 AM to say bye to my finacee as she leaves for work
* Fall back asleep, while setting an alarm for 8 AM
* Wake up at 8 AM to alarm
* Tell myself I have lots of time left before work and can sleep for another 15 mins (this happens everyday)
* Sleep in, wake up frantically at 9 AM, and realize I'm late - again

[NeedAdvice] I spent a few months getting a Gym Pass, now I have it and I've not been once.;t3_80wfrd;11;"Where I live, they offer a gym pass that allows heavily discounted usage of the gym, that needed a lot of admin faff in order to get it. I'm still not sure whether I qualified for it because of ADD, depression or obesity but it was one of those things.

But, now that I have the card, it's been around 3 weeks and I've not been a single time. I think there are several reasons why:

- I have a poor sleep routine, so I usually get up around 2-3pm.

- The gym can get very busy after 3pm with school finishing, and especially after 5pm with most workdays finishing at that time. I don't want to go when it's busy.

- I feel like I'd be extremely self conscious about my body. I've been to the gym before, but I've put on another 2-3 stone since then.

- I often forget to wash my clothes, so it's not often that I have a clean t-shirt that I can wear to go to the gym.

- Also more generally, I'm awful when it comes to procrastination, and find it very hard to close my laptop once I've opened it. I also find it very hard to get myself out of the flat, especially if it's to go to the gym.

-----

I guess I already know the solution to most of these problems:

- Try harder to correct the sleep routine, and remind myself that I now have a reason to wake up before 3pm.

- Remember to wash my clothes more often, or buy more t-shirts.

- Don't open the laptop up, maybe try to go outside for 5 minute walks to practice going outside...

...I'm still struggling to actually put any of this into practice, even though I know what I need to do in theory. Story of my life, really - I know what I *ought* to do, but aside from 1-2 weeks per year when suddenly everything feels simple and easy, I never actually *do* it in a reliable way.

I've been telling myself that this year's the year I lose weight and get fit for around a decade now. I'm 26, and I can feel my youth slipping on by while I rot in front of my laptop. I used to love being outdoors, and I really want to spend as much time outside this Spring/Summer as I can, but if I'm not fit enough to do the sports I used to love doing (cycling, climbing, kayaking etc.) I just feel regretful, and go back indoors even whilst the sun is shining.

I know that the biggest part of losing weight is dieting, but I feel like if I could establish a routine of going to the gym even twice a week, I would be able to attain a fair level of fitness before Spring/Summer come around. Hopefully by doing more exercise, I'd feel less bored and it would be easier to resist binging too, so my diet would also improve.

...As I said, I feel like I've heard it all a hundred times before (I've posted similar questions to this sub and other similar subs, and I've tried almost every strategy at least once), and I know what I ought to do, so I'm not really sure why I'm posting this in the first place... ";5;"*takes deep breath* DO IT! GO! JUST GO! EVEN LIKE 10 MINS IS ENOUGH! STOP MAKING EXCUSES!

I'm not angry. It just seems like you need a kick in the rear to get you going. Stop overanalyzing. Just go to the gym and get on a bike machine or something. Once you go, you'll have broken the inertia holding you back from going.

";5;"**TLDR; Practice going to the gym and doing very little. Get comfortable being there. Clear your head. Learn to be obnoxiously nice to yourself.**

I've had issues getting back in shape because I went from a hardcore disciplined athlete to physically unable to work out intensely within a few months. The change was abrupt and it has taken me a few years to get back to a healthy place physically and mentally. Every time I tried to get back to the gym, I would go as hard as I used to--which in my soft state absolutely kicked my butt and put me off working out for weeks or months. Repeat. For years. 

I've since moved to the mountains, where my recreational activities have helped me get moving and learn that its okay to walk not sprint, breathe heavily without embarrassment, and move my body without feeling pressure to be the best. Those lessons helped kickstart my desire to be active again. 

I bought a gym membership. I disciplined myself to NOT jump right into powerlifting heavy and running. Instead, I've been building the habit. Convince yourself to just GO to the gym. Force yourself to put your workout clothes and shoes on at home and fill a water bottle. Its easier to convince yourself to step out the door after you've made those first moves. Then, just go. No pressure. Just do a quick 10 minutes on the elliptical, some stretches, maybe an ab exercise or two. Then leave! Repeat a few more times that week. The more you force yourself to just be there, the more comfortable you will feel with the idea. You'll feel good about going to the gym even if it was only for 20 minutes. You'll give your body a little bit of movement and your brain will appreciate that. 

The biggest change for me happened since I've transformed the mean little voice inside my head into an overly excited best pal. I mentally trashed myself for years and its a work in progress. I've since adopted a new voice that is loving and supportive. My train of thought might sound like, ""Hell yeah you put your gym shoes on you're doing so great, you're a superstar! Keep it up, babe, get your butt moving you're killing it!"" It sounds super cheesy and I don't have much of a bubbly personality so it was strange at first. However, I have felt so much better and gotten a lot done by adopting that inner-voice. She thinks its super impressive to do 15 minutes on elliptical! She doesn't care what my body used to be able to do. She just thinks I'm amazing for doing a positive thing for myself. 

It takes mental discipline and time to make sure that voice is louder than your voices of sloth and self depreciation. But if you can manage to shift your mental framework, you can do amazing things like go to the gym for a few minutes or climb a dang mountain! Be patient and loving with yourself and get moving!";4;0.8;[[0.98157179]];[[0.7211627]];0.9471;0.098;0.8240000000000001;0.078;0.9976;0.185;0.774;0.040999999999999995;-0.124;0.05360990860990861;0.20944973742104891;-0.15583982881114036

I know that the biggest part of losing weight is dieting, but I feel like if I could establish a routine of going to the gym even twice a week, I would be able to attain a fair level of fitness before Spring/Summer come around. Hopefully by doing more exercise, I'd feel less bored and it would be easier to resist binging too, so my diet would also improve.

You need something outside of yourself to motivate you. If you had a movie script that was due at the end of the week or else you wouldn’t be getting your $90,000, I bet you’d be working no matter how you felt. 

So figure out a way to impose a serious deadline. You can maybe join a group of people who motivate each other or you can put money on the line and say that if you don’t do X by a certain date you will donate money to an awful awful cause, like the NRA or Trump. 

It’s hard to motivate yourself sometimes. I know I work best when there’s a deadline. For example, I’ve been very very busy at work and haven’t had much time to work on my own personal projects.

I would very much appreciate any advice on how to deal with defeat.";28;"Thank you for posting this. I've been struggling with the idea of:

&gt;I will never attain inner peace or ever feel validated.

Actively changing my verbiage is one thing that has been helping me lately. I've been working on not saying the word ""never"",  and replacing it with ""not right now"" or ""on my way to"". The sentence I quoted would feel so difference if it were to say ""While I'm not there yet, I'm on my way to feeling validated and attaining inner peace."" 

It may sound a little goofy, but if you think about all the weight the word *never* carries (being incapable, guilty, inadequate, etc) what it means in a literal sense (which is how your brain is interpreting it, even if you are just using it as an expressive term), it may be hindering you towards reaching your goals. You're asking for advice on dealing with defeat, and it's not defeat - it's a setback. 

This is mainly in relation to your fear of being pulled into the pit of internal darkness though. As for the exam, that's some BS. If it's supposed to be an exam on a specific chapter or even a mid-term, 1 practice sheet shouldn't be what you learn all the material from or the deciding factor on how you score. You were adequately prepared by studying the exam topic, that should've been enough.

Thank you!;3;"Your biological clock is set to wake up at about 10 o'clock and go to sleep at 2. The biological clock is an actual brain structure in the hypothalamus, so the good news is that you can actually adjust it. They key is getting light exposure as soon as you wake up, and preferably before 10 o clock. In this case, your rhythm will gradually shift to an earlier time. The earlier you expose yourself to light in the morning the faster your rhythm will shift. On the other side, too much light in the evening will shift your rhythm to a later time. So it isn't just discipline, you need to get used to a new wake and sleep schedule. 

You could either be aggressive, and wake up at for example at 8 every day, and force yourself to go outside as soon as possible. This will probably shift your rhythm in a week or two, however, you will have to suffer through some sleep deprivation, because sleeping at 11-12 o clock will be hard.

[NeedAdvice] How do I fix my sleep schedule?;t3_82ab5n;4;Hey r/getdisciplined, I have been having trouble for a few months now (on and off for a few years) of maintaining a healthy sleeping schedule. I am a college student, and I usually schedule my classes as early as I can to force myself to get up, as unpleasant as it can be, but this semester I don't start my day until after 10 am. I recently started Accutane almost 2 months ago, and one of the side effects has to do with the quality and quantity of your sleep. I am in this cycle now where I either stay up to late playing video games, studying, reading, browsing Reddit, or simply can't fall asleep, which subsequently makes it harder to wake up in the morning before 10 am. Since I wake up at 10 am, I now have energy that keeps me up past midnight.

Thank you!;3;"Yep as other person said, just lay down close your eyes and focus on breathing.

You don't have to be ""out"" to let your body and mind rest, you can just lay there and chill out.

Other thing is tuning out the blue light at night to allow melatonin to secrete rather than get inhibited from the blue light. Flux app helps and also just shying away from using electronics at night";1;0.33333333333333337;[[0.93634085]];[[0.54095789]];0.9620000000000001;0.11900000000000001;0.847;0.033;0.5267;0.087;0.87;0.043;0.042;-0.0861111111111111;0.056349206349206364;-0.14246031746031745
[NeedAdvice] I am failing to be reliable. How to get back my confidence?;t3_8105hq;3;"I can't talk to any one in my family or to my best friends because it feels really embarrassing.
My downfall started last summer after pretty tough semester at school which I combined with full time work and some side projects. 

I failed with one of my clients (I am a web developer) when he tried to reach out to me so I can work more on a system I worked before, but I didn't answer immediately and I somehow felt guilty because of not responding in a short time and I never responded to him back. 

In the beginning of the summer I also found a new client who brought me two projects what was really crucial for me. Unfortunately, my designer failed to do his part on time, but my client was ok with that and I was in a progress of working on the projects. My plan was to finish these two projects in a month, but I haven't finished them until now.

Something happened and I was totally in depression, mostly I was lying in bed and didn't do anything.  
I was thinking that may be it is a burnout after tough spring semester, or maybe it is because of failed project I lost my confidence.

Then in the middle of the summer I've got another good client and failed again because of delayed response. I wasn't too busy, moreover it is very important for me to get projects because only I can support myself and pay for living and school. So at this time I felt guilt again and never answered my client. 

I was only working with my long term client (he can't provide stable work load though but it is very helpful for me). In the end of the summer I had a very bad sleep cycle. I started sleeping all the day while spending nights in the office of my long term client mostly wasting time after finishing work (I worked from 6 pm to 11 am and then wasted my time coming home at 6-7 am). 

Then fall semester started and I felt some drive to deal with everything, my mood improved a little bit. In the end of October I've found a new client (unfortunately he wasn't a good client but was helpful in terms of money) so during November I worked for this client 40-50 hours a week and 10-15 hours on my long term client and also I had a school (12 units - I spent about 20 hours a week). It was very tough period with average sleep time 4.5 hours a night. In the middle of December I had some misunderstanding with my new client and I refunded him for one week, while he threatened me with court and asked me to finish work for free, but he never provided any strict specifications and I was helping him to create a project plan, the problem appeared when he decided to do a lot of changes to what I built without even fully reviewing my work. I dealt with that and he never talked to me back. 

After this client my sleep schedule remained very bad, I felt totally burnt out again, then I've got sick fo a week in the beginning of January and after I was just laying at home doing mostly nothing. In the February I've started fixing my sleep schedule and now I am mostly in bed before 1 am and my average sleep time is 7 hours. Sleeping good helped me a bit, I've started exercising 2-3 times a week (running and some bodyweight exercises)

But still it is hard for me to do anything, I mostly procrastinate by reading books (self help or philosophy) and don't do what is crucial for me - looking for new projects/clients. 
Also during this 9 month period I borrowed some money and every problem with my clients resulted in bad reviews in my work profile, so it makes it harder for me to find new clients.

So I am feeling that I have failed everything, every good opportunity during this period and I can't think of my self as reliable. My confidence is very low (only running helps me to get back some of my confidence) and living paycheck to paycheck is lowering it even further. I can't even talk to any one about this because it feels embarrassing, so I need to lie to my mom and best friends. 

My plan is to solve all the problems with my previous clients, and some other problems which appeared during this period. 

May be I need to fail completely to free myself from fear of failure? 
How can I get back my confidence and not to fail completely? 
How to take action?

Thanks and sorry for long reading!";1;"To me it seems very clear, you've already failed. Accept this fact. I say this in response of your idea of perhaps having to totally fail before things get better. There will always be a worse situation than the one you currently in, so I suggest starting working on it. I doubt anyone can help you, as this is your life and your actions. My advice would be to start working again, and do not make bullshit excuses, which you seem to have plenty of. Do your work, get it done. I wish you luck, OP, Godspeed.

PS: Do not be embarrassed in telling close friends or family about your situation. We are only but humans, we need support and understanding, specifically from those we value and love.

[Need Advice] How to tell the difference between fatigue and a lack of discipline?;t3_85tq0l;9;"I'm looking for help with figuring out whether I just need to work harder or if it's something else. I searched in the subreddit before I posted and I couldn't find anything that exactly related to my situation. I'm hoping to find people with similar experiences who have some insight. I've included lists of advice from this subreddit that I'm implemented and also advice that I haven't implemented yet.

About me and about the problem:

* I have ADHD, I take a stimulant in the morning along with an antidepressant. People usually need to up their stimulant dosage over time but I haven't done that, mostly because it feels like I have to just get more sleep.
* I've been tired for at least four years, and since January it's gotten worse
* I'm a student and my class schedule is such that I have a morning class every day followed by several hours of nothing before my afternoon class. Sometimes I go home during this time and sometimes I stay on campus and tutor.
* No matter what I do with this time between classes, I'm tired. If I'm at home I lay in bed for at least an hour. If I'm on campus I try to find somewhere to lay down.

Advice from r/getdisciplined that I've implemented:

* Consistent bed/wake time. I get into bed between 10:15 and 11:15, and I wake up between 6:30 and 7.
* Morning routine. I won't go into too much detail but I'm eating well in the mornings, I make my bed, I have a skincare routine, etc.
* Diet. I've lost almost twenty pounds since New Years by limiting the calories I eat. I eat much better than almost every college student I know. I try to eat carbs/proteins/fats in the proportion of 40/30/30.

Advice I haven't implemented yet:

* Hard exercise. When I went to a doctor on Friday to discuss the fatigue she was adamant that I should be doing more exercise. I used to do C25K last semester but stopped eventually because it was getting colder out and I felt I wasn't making as much progress. Mostly because I was tired.
* Avoiding screens before bed. I know that I need to be more disciplined in this regard because it would probably make my sleep more restful.

I'm open to the idea that I just need to be working harder and getting disciplined. However, there have been other times where I thought I just needed to work harder but I ended up just burning myself out. So I guess I'm wondering if I'm been babying myself too much. 

";32;"Honestly with you already on antidepressants and a stimulant, my first thoughts are that something with dosage needs to be adjusted there. But, I'm not a doctor, so take that for what it's worth. 
I don't have ADHD, but I do have anxiety and depression and getting the meds right on that made the world of difference for me in wanting to just sleep all the time and be constantly tired (despite normal sleep patterns and even exercise), and feeling like a normally functioning human.

";32;"I also misunderstood the part about you LACKING hard exercise. I cant overstate how much having a gym membership will change your life for the better.

It will turn from a chore, to something you enjoy and crave. Not only will you feel and look better,  it will boost your confidence and increase your self worth, witch is doubly important since you are struggling with depression. You WILL feel better mentally and physically. Grab your headphones and Spotify playlist that amps you up (for me its heavy metal) and don’t worry about anyone else who is there. My routine includes 10 min of stretching, 20 of weights, followed by 15-20mins of cardio. This is honestly not that intensive and if you take an hour out of your day 4-5 days a week you will see A 180 turn around. Im actually heading to the gym right now.

";32;"I have ADHD also and feel constantly fatigued like you. I take adderall and usually ill go heavy on the dosage if i need the energy. I also work at Starbucks so I drink alot of coffee.  Ive found that not being consistent with medication affects my motivation and energy levels.

Do you feel that your fatigue is much worse than the norm? Ive come to realize that everyone is tired all the time too.

Also the medication might not be working for you, consider alternatives that might be more effective. 

Ive also been trying the keto diet, something about cutting carbs makes me feel so much better. I am not a nutritionist, but maybe might work for you. My sister is gluten intolerant, so I might be more sensitive than you. But it’s something worth looking into, as carbs are converted into fuel for short bursts, giving you peaks and valleys in your energy levels . I focus on higher fats and protein, getting carbs naturally from veggies including leafy greens. I avoid all starches and carb heavy foods, and have lost 10 pounds in less than a month. Next time you get a burger ditch the bun and go lettuce wrap. Its my go to lately .

Good luck. I’ll be checking in to see how its going.";3;0.09375;[[0.96349398]];[[0.50344109]];-0.8679;0.055;0.871;0.07400000000000001;0.893;0.11699999999999999;0.813;0.07;-0.066;0.03950441919191918;0.06666666666666665;-0.027162247474747468

";32;"Not a doctor, but here is what I do so I know when I'm tired (programmer and I live in a poor country so limited access to psychological health): I try doing an easier version of what I'm studying. For example, coding is harder than reading, if I can't code anymore I just read articles to get better. Reading is harder than watching videos. If I can't read I watch videos or screencasts of what I'm learning. This is all done with social media including Reddit blocked so I have no choice but to put in work. If I truly cannot understand what the hell the video is saying, then that's the limit.

At which I can even try something non-programming or something that is even non-brain, like doing crunches or doing a few pushups. I don't know if this helps, but you want to make sure that when you're tired, you're really at the limit.

";32;I'm at work but look into intermittent fasting, there's a subreddit, it may help while you figure out what the root cause is for your fatigue. I have an awful habit of going to bed too late and I would almost fall asleep driving to work, sleep every break time. I stopped eating so many damn meals that I thought I had to (would get an acid stomach when I didn't eat on time). Fasting until 12.30pm has worked wonders, I cope so much better with less sleep now and don't have to worry as much about dividing calories into 5 meals, just lunch and dinner now. I lost weight and crave food less, and all I had to do was drink way more water to help my stomach, and it trained itself within a week anyway.

";32;"I’m ADHD-PI and have total lethargy, none of the hyperactivity at all, so I feel like I’m in a good position to answer this. 

Have you ever taken time off your drugs? Sometimes I become too dependent on the stimulant effect of the drugs and assume it’s not working as well as it should, until I take a week off, then I REALLY see what it’s like to be unmedicated. 

One really noticeable difference I have is that on medication, I don’t really care to stay in bed. Off medication, my whole body has an aching to be all comfy under the covers and getting out of bed is a huge task. 

I can be lazy on medication but the difference is that it’s more of a choice as opposed to off meds. I’m too lazy to go to the gym even while on meds, for example, but that’s normal.

You have to keep in mind that it’s a natural human instinct to want to conserve energy, both mental and physical. True motivation is rare and doesn’t last and you’re never going to reach a point where you consistently want to do the right thing easily and without having to force yourself. We only did things like exercise or face difficulty in the ancestral environment because we were forced to. Now, these things are a choice. And you have to make the decision to override your natural instincts over and over again. The most you can hope for is that this choice gets slightly less difficult the more habitual something becomes. As an example, I used a habit tracker to make habits out of doing dishes and making my bed and the habits carried over even when off meds and fully lazy in all other areas. 

Anyways, fatigue is something you would feel in general, not just when you’re about to do something. If you suddenly feel tired only when you have to go to the gym or do something you don’t want, then you’re probably just lazy.

[NeedAdvice] Engineering student fed up with my lack of discipline;t3_84nzi5;2;"Sorry for if this is a long rant. 

tl/dr. I feel like I'm failing uni, I don't have that much support, and I want to learn to rely on myself. How do I stop giving up when things get difficult?

I'm a 22 y/o Chemical engineering student in my 4th year of a 5 year degree. I'm currently doing my thesis, and two other courses this semester. I've been dealing with stress and anxiety constantly for the last few years, and it's gotten to the point where I am almost numb to it and just cannot motivate myself anymore. I try to discipline myself and develop a routine, and then it disintegrates, over and over, and now I am just completely fed up with this cycle, and with myself and my inability to just get up and do what I need to do.

Some wider context: I have always felt somewhat incapable in this degree, I think everyone does a little. In my third year I failed almost all my winter exams and it put me into a pretty bad depression - I think I definitely suffer from some mild seasonal affective disorder. Things were so bad, I had to take some time out of university. A year later, I did my resits and came back to do the rest of third year. I needed to prove to myself once and for all that I could do it, and I worked the hardest I ever have in my life. At some points I was pulling 14 hr days, and I had a couple of breakdowns because I was pushing myself so hard. It wasn't great, but I managed to pass all my exams that semester, some of them with A's. There was definitely a cathartic sense of relief and that things paid off.

Last semester (4th year) however, the same thing happened. I think I wasn't prepared for the jump again, the S.A.D, and I just had no idea how to balance my thesis. I also have a fair amount of resentment for my university as the workload is just unmanageable, especially for someone who struggles like me. We had 4 classes, (4 exams), and were expected to do a lot of preliminary work for the thesis. I managed to get medical exemption for my exams because of insomnia and anxiety, but now I'll have to do four resits in the summer.

This semester things aren't getting better. I tried really hard to make sure I would start on the right foot, I made schedules, routines, did some reflection, read books (7 habits by Covey), and have been seeing a counsellor. For a while, I was quite disciplined and I was managing to keep a routine and keep my sleep together. However the amount of work I had left undone for my thesis caught up with me and I ended up missing classes for the first 2 weeks to meet a deadline for it.

I have my thesis, an engineering course, and I've taken a computational modelling course as my free elective. I have completely lost motivation. I have shot myself in the foot with both my thesis and the physics course. I had a good relationship with this thesis supervisor and thought it would be a good idea to choose him, I was also told that the physics modelling course has quite a light workload and guarantees a pass.

My thesis is so esoteric and unrelated to what we've been taught, that I am constantly getting stuck in fine details. I also generally struggle to write, partly because of perfectionism, and partly because of my lack of discipline. I am supposed to be doing simulations but the help from my supervisor regarding this was quite light, he also referred me to a PhD student working on the same topic. I think they both thought I was getting more help from the other person, and last semester because I was so overloaded I didn't manage to meet with the PhD student more than 6 times. Now he's gone to another country and I'm stuck not understanding the intricacies and theory of the software and programs I'm using. I've told my supervisor and he has said that as long as I meet the marking scheme and show good critical analysis, even if the simulations don't work, I'll still get a good grade.

Basically whenever I am motivated to do work it feels like one step forward, three steps back. It's the exact same with the physics course. As a group of three, we were told to come up with a modelling project and do a report and presentation on it.

For some stupid reason we thought Kessler's syndrome would be interesting and manageable. Not being physics students we asked the course coordinators opinion and he said it was a good project idea. Every hour we spend on it we get more confused and it's clear the way we're trying to do things might not work.

I have five pages of work for my thesis and a crappy simulation of the motion of a single satellite. Both of these pieces of work have final deadlines in the next month and a half. I have become almost so resigned to the fact that I am going to fail, that it's hard for me to try anymore.

Reddit I don't know what to do. I'm so fed up. I've talked to people about this but I just keep falling into the same holes. I also realized that I am just not a happy person. I sacrificed hobbies and my personality, to get good grades. Now I have no friends and I feel like I've lost my identity. I hate this city I'm in also, it's an absolute shit hole with cold weather, cold people, and pretty much nothing to do but drink (which I don't do).

I feel like the last four years were completely wasted. If I think about the amount of money that has been paid for the tuition, I don't think it's worth it. I have learnt some things, but more than anything university has just broken me. The chronic stress has killed my happiness and emotion, the massive failure has taught me that the only way I can survive is to just not care. My parents got divorced when I was young and I only have my mother, my relationship with her is okay but she doesn't understand the pressure and I never look to her for support. My girlfriend is probably the only reason I have made it this far, but she has graduated and is currently in another city 200 miles away. The long distance relationship doesn't bother me too much, but I feel completely isolated. I don't have anyone else to push me, I'm not close with my roommates, and I don't have any close friends.

Elon Musk and Richard Feynman are my role models in life. I want to graduate and do something good. I want to advance the human race in some way. But I know this isn't easy and that it is hard work. I want to learn how to stop giving up. I have no resolve. As soon as something gets difficult or painful, either I shy away, or my sleep starts screwing up, one way or another I'm back in a rut.

The past few days I've been waking up at 1pm, completely frustrated with my inability to get out of bed when the alarm goes off. Yesterday my lack of motivation was so severe that I just stayed in bed until 8pm and went out for breakfast. I've been on Beta-blockers, but I'm considering going on anti-depressants. I don't generally feel depressed but I am consistently average. I guess the sleep and lack of motivation is also symptomatic.

I want to change. I want to have discipline. I want to stop procrastinating, and I want to have the willpower to face myself and do the things I know I need to. I want to stop staying up late, delaying the next day by not sleeping. I want to set ground rules to stop me from staying up and to stop me from falling into these ruts. Whenever I try, I inevitably have a bad day that unbalances everything.

How do I be strong? How do I stop giving up. How do I stop overplanning things and actually stick to the routine and plans I already have.";13;"The first thing you need to do, right now, is go do something that helps you to relieve stress. Not just anything mind you, do something productive. Listen to a good song, go outside for a nature walk, sit and close your eyes, read a book. Just do something that doesn't require a lot of mental thought or strain and do that for 15 minutes, please. You need to calm your mind, because you're all over the place right now, mentally. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Seriously, go do that now. This post will still be here when you get back. i promise. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Are you back? Great! Then lets get this thing started. 

&amp;nbsp; 

The first thing I want to tell you is that everything is going to be alright. What you're going through right now sucks, but you're going to come out of this, I can assure you. Now, unfortunately, I have no words of guidance in regards to your particular major and choice of study in school. I didn't study Engineering in school, so I can't personally empathize with you in that regard. What I can empathize with you on, is the lack of motivation you feel towards school and your work. I was studying Computer Science, and the classes literally kicked my ass each semester. Other personal aspects of life were involved in my academic difficulty, but ultimately, my motivation was always shot. I'd periodically have moments where I'd realize that I wasn't happy with my current performance, and wanted to change, but I'd always lose sight of that realization one way or another. 

&amp;nbsp; 

It just felt like a never ending cycle of poor performance, regret, self pity  and self realization on a constant loop. I could never break out of it, and it always left me feeling worse and worse with myself whenever the loop would restart. I knew I lacked the discipline I thought necessary to turn things around, and I was always in search of the way to create it. I'd search Reddit, Google, YouTube, books, other people, anything I could find that promised me the guarantee of everlasting discipline and drive to get things done. I was lost and in search for this discipline for 2 years, before finally finding the answer within myself, and I'd like to share my findings with you here today. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**STEP 1: MINDSET**

&gt; How do I be strong? How do I stop giving up.

The first thing you need to understand about discipline, is that it's simply a mindset. Discipline doesn't meant the absence of temptation and distraction, it means the acknowledgement of all these things, and still choosing to be productive with your actions. A proper mindset is the single most important thing you can develop as an individual, and without one, you in inevitably fail. You've gone through many hardships so far in school, and these hardships have worn you down mentally. The reason they are wearing you down, is because you're putting unnecessary stress and mental consequence into these things. Missing an opportunity, failing a test, flunking a course, failing yourself. All of these things are unfortunate and they can hurt, but you don't need to constantly bombard yourself with negativity when they happen. Instead, you use events and circumstances in your life as lessons for improvement. 

&amp;nbsp; 

There is always something that can be learned within each failure, no matter how small. Instead of dwelling on the failure itself, use your mind to focus on the lesson within that failure. Think about what lead you to that failure, what the consequences were, and what you can do to improve and not reach that failure in the future. Feel the emotions that come with failure, but don't let them cripple you from taking future action or making a similar decision with an improved plan. Life is about learning from your mistakes and improving yourself through failure until you reach success. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**STEP 2: RESPONSIBILITY**

&gt;  I don't have anyone else to push me, I'm not close with my roommates, and I don't have any close friends.

I believe the phrase ""Take responsibility for your actions"" is a secretly legendary phrase that not too many people use to their advantage. Most people assume the phrase speaks on owning up to your mistakes instead of trying to find your way out of them, but that's only a portion of the phrase. Responsibility in oneself is the realization that one is only in control of their own actions, thoughts and decisions. No matter how hard you try, you can't control the actions, thoughts or decisions of anyone else, so there isn't any necessary need to worry about them. External factors can have influence on you, people's opinions can have influence on you, and this influence can be unbearably strong, but ultimately, only you can make you move. Only you can make a decision for yourself. So use that to your advantage. If there are any changes you want to make within your life, all you need to do is make that decision and take action. It's as simple as that. However, the reason people continuously face resistance within this desire to change, is the reason so many people find it hard to change, even when they want to. 

&amp;nbsp; 


**STEP 3: PERSISTENCE**

&gt; I want to change. I want to have discipline. I want to stop procrastinating, and I want to have the willpower to face myself and do the things I know I need to.

Quite literally the secret behind all of this. Persistence truly was the key all long. The reason people find it so hard to do the things they want to do, is because they aren't persistent with their intent. Now, you may be thinking to yourself that you already know this, but do you know **why** you aren't persistent with your intent to get disciplined, stop procrastinating and have more willpower? 

**It's because you're used to doing the opposite**

If you're used to procrastinating, being lazy and not holding yourself to anything, you're always going to continue to do so, whether you truly want to or not. The reason for this, is because those decisions have become second nature to you through constant repetition and persistence of being lazy, procrastinating and not holding yourself to anything. Any one thing you do over an extended period of time becomes easier to do. Eventually, it becomes something so easy, you can do it without even thinking about it. That's called second nature, and that's what your current habits and decisions are based around when it comes to academic hardship and adversity. The way to change this is to introduce into your life new forms of persistence through positive habit and decision making. 

&amp;nbsp; 

When you feel like shit for procrastinating on something, and though you think to yourself that you should be doing something else, but don't move, it's because you're mind is fighting you in order to remain comfortable. That homework needs to be done, but for some reason you just can't move and get started. That's because you're used to not doing your homework until you absolutely need to do it. You've worked yourself into that habit, so it's something you do without thinking about it. The way to beat this habit and create one of productivity is to force yourself to do your homework. You force yourself to work, and do it daily. What this does is gradually break away at your current habit and create a new one. One that you can be more proud of. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Will it be hard? Of course it will. You've experienced the difficulty of this through your life. The constant loss of motivation, the lack of discipline, it's all because your mind is fighting you to remain in the state it's at. It doesn't know that it's current state is harmful to you and it in the long run, it only knows that it's always slacked off and procrastinated, and it sees no dire reason to change. You however, know better, so it's on you to **force** that change within it. Stick through the fight your mind puts up, and eventually, it'll conform to the new set of habits you're trying to implement and will make those new habits the new normal, and before you know it, you'll have a whole new set of second nature habits. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I hope this helps you, man. :)

[NeedAdvice] Engineering student fed up with my lack of discipline;t3_84nzi5;2;"Sorry for if this is a long rant. 

tl/dr. I feel like I'm failing uni, I don't have that much support, and I want to learn to rely on myself. How do I stop giving up when things get difficult?

I'm a 22 y/o Chemical engineering student in my 4th year of a 5 year degree. I'm currently doing my thesis, and two other courses this semester. I've been dealing with stress and anxiety constantly for the last few years, and it's gotten to the point where I am almost numb to it and just cannot motivate myself anymore. I try to discipline myself and develop a routine, and then it disintegrates, over and over, and now I am just completely fed up with this cycle, and with myself and my inability to just get up and do what I need to do.

Some wider context: I have always felt somewhat incapable in this degree, I think everyone does a little. In my third year I failed almost all my winter exams and it put me into a pretty bad depression - I think I definitely suffer from some mild seasonal affective disorder. Things were so bad, I had to take some time out of university. A year later, I did my resits and came back to do the rest of third year. I needed to prove to myself once and for all that I could do it, and I worked the hardest I ever have in my life. At some points I was pulling 14 hr days, and I had a couple of breakdowns because I was pushing myself so hard. It wasn't great, but I managed to pass all my exams that semester, some of them with A's. There was definitely a cathartic sense of relief and that things paid off.

Last semester (4th year) however, the same thing happened. I think I wasn't prepared for the jump again, the S.A.D, and I just had no idea how to balance my thesis. I also have a fair amount of resentment for my university as the workload is just unmanageable, especially for someone who struggles like me. We had 4 classes, (4 exams), and were expected to do a lot of preliminary work for the thesis. I managed to get medical exemption for my exams because of insomnia and anxiety, but now I'll have to do four resits in the summer.

This semester things aren't getting better. I tried really hard to make sure I would start on the right foot, I made schedules, routines, did some reflection, read books (7 habits by Covey), and have been seeing a counsellor. For a while, I was quite disciplined and I was managing to keep a routine and keep my sleep together. However the amount of work I had left undone for my thesis caught up with me and I ended up missing classes for the first 2 weeks to meet a deadline for it.

I have my thesis, an engineering course, and I've taken a computational modelling course as my free elective. I have completely lost motivation. I have shot myself in the foot with both my thesis and the physics course. I had a good relationship with this thesis supervisor and thought it would be a good idea to choose him, I was also told that the physics modelling course has quite a light workload and guarantees a pass.

My thesis is so esoteric and unrelated to what we've been taught, that I am constantly getting stuck in fine details. I also generally struggle to write, partly because of perfectionism, and partly because of my lack of discipline. I am supposed to be doing simulations but the help from my supervisor regarding this was quite light, he also referred me to a PhD student working on the same topic. I think they both thought I was getting more help from the other person, and last semester because I was so overloaded I didn't manage to meet with the PhD student more than 6 times. Now he's gone to another country and I'm stuck not understanding the intricacies and theory of the software and programs I'm using. I've told my supervisor and he has said that as long as I meet the marking scheme and show good critical analysis, even if the simulations don't work, I'll still get a good grade.

Basically whenever I am motivated to do work it feels like one step forward, three steps back. It's the exact same with the physics course. As a group of three, we were told to come up with a modelling project and do a report and presentation on it.

For some stupid reason we thought Kessler's syndrome would be interesting and manageable. Not being physics students we asked the course coordinators opinion and he said it was a good project idea. Every hour we spend on it we get more confused and it's clear the way we're trying to do things might not work.

I have five pages of work for my thesis and a crappy simulation of the motion of a single satellite. Both of these pieces of work have final deadlines in the next month and a half. I have become almost so resigned to the fact that I am going to fail, that it's hard for me to try anymore.

Reddit I don't know what to do. I'm so fed up. I've talked to people about this but I just keep falling into the same holes. I also realized that I am just not a happy person. I sacrificed hobbies and my personality, to get good grades. Now I have no friends and I feel like I've lost my identity. I hate this city I'm in also, it's an absolute shit hole with cold weather, cold people, and pretty much nothing to do but drink (which I don't do).

I feel like the last four years were completely wasted. If I think about the amount of money that has been paid for the tuition, I don't think it's worth it. I have learnt some things, but more than anything university has just broken me. The chronic stress has killed my happiness and emotion, the massive failure has taught me that the only way I can survive is to just not care. My parents got divorced when I was young and I only have my mother, my relationship with her is okay but she doesn't understand the pressure and I never look to her for support. My girlfriend is probably the only reason I have made it this far, but she has graduated and is currently in another city 200 miles away. The long distance relationship doesn't bother me too much, but I feel completely isolated. I don't have anyone else to push me, I'm not close with my roommates, and I don't have any close friends.

Elon Musk and Richard Feynman are my role models in life. I want to graduate and do something good. I want to advance the human race in some way. But I know this isn't easy and that it is hard work. I want to learn how to stop giving up. I have no resolve. As soon as something gets difficult or painful, either I shy away, or my sleep starts screwing up, one way or another I'm back in a rut.

The past few days I've been waking up at 1pm, completely frustrated with my inability to get out of bed when the alarm goes off. Yesterday my lack of motivation was so severe that I just stayed in bed until 8pm and went out for breakfast. I've been on Beta-blockers, but I'm considering going on anti-depressants. I don't generally feel depressed but I am consistently average. I guess the sleep and lack of motivation is also symptomatic.

I want to change. I want to have discipline. I want to stop procrastinating, and I want to have the willpower to face myself and do the things I know I need to. I want to stop staying up late, delaying the next day by not sleeping. I want to set ground rules to stop me from staying up and to stop me from falling into these ruts. Whenever I try, I inevitably have a bad day that unbalances everything.

How do I be strong? How do I stop giving up. How do I stop overplanning things and actually stick to the routine and plans I already have.";13;"&gt; At some points I was pulling 14 hr days, and I had a couple of breakdowns because I was pushing myself so hard. It wasn't great, but I managed to pass all my exams that semester, some of them with A's.

Ah, more proof that mental breakdowns allow for large neural rewiring.

My method delves around the roots of stress and forming an objective perspective of it, cause by viewing it as a cluster of primarily instinctive reactions - it becomes easy to hack it to our advantage.

First, a bit of bad news - you inadvertently allowed your fear response to get to a very high level by simply allowing it too much.  BUT not your fault - so not your fault.  REALLY NOT your fault.

People in very stressful circumstances (especially being alone) are just naturally going to feel a lot of fear.

Second, the good news.  We can cut off the fear response right off at the source by controlling it with mere breathing-pattern.  The secret to meditation lies in that calm people can still breath calmly even during stressful circumstances.

Check your breathing now, OP.  Try to get it to deep, long, slow.

To be fair to myself, a couple of years ago I literally wanted to die. I've gotten into a really good place comparatively where whilst I don't want to die, I still don't see the point in persuing anything for myself. 

This is partially because every time I've tried I've been stopped in my tracks by my illness or the anxiety it gives me, so I have fairly strong confirmation I might fail or be disappointed. I feel so fragile most days that I'm scared of being disappointed.

If I get a job I get bullied out of it by my employers for being too sick to work sometimes. But I can't get disability pay so I'm feeling pretty stuck and useless. I'm very fortunate to have supportive parents, however. I am lucky! 

Sorry it's so long but in summary... I'm in a bit of a state. I so want to do better, get a few habits going so I'm not just sitting around all the time. So I feel value in my days. 

I'm pretty severely depressed but I'm also quite a joyful person. I really take the time to appreciate the beauty in things around me. I don't take things for granted. But I want to do better. If anyone has any tips, I would be so, so grateful. ";14;"Hey! Spoonie here. I like to sing and write too! I also have similar issues with chronic fatigue, physical limitations, and work difficulties.

It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by being inspired and wanting to improve your life yet too exhausted to follow through? 

One thing, songs don't have to be long or complicated. 3 verses, 3 chords, and youve got the recipe for many beloved songs. 

The important part that you enjoy it, which you already do so you've got that going! Congrats on finding something you love. :)

Ive been working on my songs and writing a little bit at a time for years! To me, that gives them a certain depth, like, a relationship where the song grows as i do. Does this resonate?

Here's a few questions to ask that might help you.

1) is there a time of day i feel most energized/ have a burst of energy?

2) is there an environment i can go (office, corner of bedroom, porch, the shower) just for creative expression?

3) would i like to try to set a timer for 15 minutes and experiment without an end goal? 

4) am i willing to make note of what i liked from that 15 minutes? A lyric, a melody, etc.


Hope this helps. :)";3;0.21428571428571427;[[0.97156931]];[[0.68718469]];0.9697;0.195;0.631;0.174;0.9941;0.258;0.7140000000000001;0.027999999999999997;-0.209;0.07069576719576719;0.2264955357142857;-0.1557997685185185
[NeedAdvice] years of chronic illness have beaten me to a pulp, how do I get motivated again?;t3_7w84u9;2;"I got seriously sick when I was around 8 years old. I had been sick since birth but not to a disabling degree, which all changed that one day.

My illness limits me in my physical capabilities. I can't do any kind of strenuous exercise without nearly throwing up / blacking out. I used to love riding my bike. I have recently started going on a short walk every day, so there's that at least! 

Day to day, my energy levels vary from feeling like I haven't slept in a week to sorta decent, on good days. I suffer from gastro issues that limit me to my house a lot of the time.

I can't use any commercial products such as shampoo / conditioner / deodorant and have to use natural alternatives or I'll break out all over in hives, which makes simple things such as showering a lot more of a pain in the butt than they need to be. It doesn't help when I have such low energy to begin with.

I used to have goals for myself but it's gotten to the point where I just don't even want to do anything. I want to want to do things (if that makes sense) but, I just don't.

Cheers";2;"I understand what you're saying. I often find myself in the same situation. Lots of motivation and ideas when i'm on the go but as soon as i'm 'home' it all goes away. This is because of exactly what motivation is. Motivation is fleeting, a finite source of temporary energy, its the whole reason you're here at get disciplined. 

Because discipline is different from motivation. Motivation operates under the condition that you have to 'feel' a certain way to do a task. When you think about it, thats a grossly illogical thing to do. You wouldnt wait to be in olympic form to start training for the olympics right? you have to train to get in olympic form. 

We live in an instant gratification world now, people want results and satisfaction immediately and forget that for results, you need to put in the work. And you wont always feel like doing that.

That's where discipline comes in. It separates your emotions from the tasks at hand. It does this in an unforgiving and tough way. You got to tell yourself that my emotions are inconsequential to what needs to be done now, i'm not going to complain, i'm not going to procrastinate. I'm going to buckle down and focus and do what i know i always wanted to do.

From what you said in your post, i can see that you're clearly looking for a way to sustain motivation, the sad truth is, you cannot. But let me tell you this, if you work at your goals, little by little every day, you will obtain the results you're looking for. What i'd recommend for you is to focus on building one habit-goal at a time, a habit-goal is a habit that you do on a daily basis that helps you work towards a certain goal. For example, dedicating 1 hr a day to work towards your business start up, maybe you use this time to cold-call, or network. Maybe you use this time to come up with a business plan, whatever it maybe, work towards your goal. Do this every day for 3 weeks, and then maybe you can add in an hour for learning a language. The last thing you want to do is overwhelm yourself by undertaking a lot of things as once. take it slow, do it right and deliberately and you'll find yourself creating the right habits and going in the right direction. 

Even the motivation to progress your life towards a better direction is fleeting. It is why discipline is so key, You wont always feel like getting out of bed in the morning, you wont always feel like eating right you wont always feel like exercising. But, remind yourself, you aint a little bitch and you aint complaining. because you know what needs to be done and how it needs to get done. Once you make your emotions inconsequential to your actions, you'll find yourself moving towards your goals in an almost psychopathic way. Hope this helped, if you're looking for more reading material, i always go to the top posts of all time of this subreddit and read through popular posts. A lot of people post a lot of ""how to do's"", i find before that you have to understand how discipline works and why its the key to what you're looking for. 

However, dont fall into the trap that just because you KNOW how to be disciplined now, means you're disciplined. actions speak louder than words, dont just think about how you can be more disciplined. ACT on it. Do the thing, Dont complain about it. Complaining takes a toll, trust me, the only way to learn how to do any of this is to just do it. 

Here is a link to a post that i found particularly helpful and i think will help you understand what needs to be done to achieve the goals that you've set for yourself.

It sounds like that you are really motivated the night before and when you wake the motivation has gone. This is partly because motivation disappears in time but it also is because at night you know you don't have to do any of the work so you're effectively passing off the responsibilty to someone else (your future self). It's important to bear this in mind.

Don't have your phone in your room let alone within arms reach of your bed. If you need an alarm then buy one. This is only if you use your phone in the mornings and stopping you from being productive.

When you first wake up is when you rely on autopilot and habits the most. It is important to recognise this when trying to stop bad habits.

I just feel like I really need a good forward push to kickstart my day. Any tips ? ";14;"Goals are a byproduct of the habits and practices we consistently accomplish. 
Set a SMART goal and then use small achievable milestones as goalposts to guide your daily practice. 

Goal: Get up early and be productive
This is too vague. 
Be more specific: Get up by 6 am
It may also not be achievable. You must start with where you are and slowly work up to your goal. 
Start with when you normally wake up today and try to wake up 25 min earlier each week. That’s 5 min each work day. 
Along with your current wake time this can create a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goal. 
E.g. if you wake up at 8 am today. Give yourself a month to wake up by 6 am. 
A month is the minimum amount of dedication to create a habit and waking up 5 min earlier each day crates realistic, achievable goals and can easily translate into a game to see if you can beat your wake up time by more than 5 min. 

To make success more certain crate daily habits that support your goals and create mantras to remind yourself why you want to wake up early. 
Maybe it’s to do some yoga or exercise or meditation. Or just to be able to have time to make a healthy breakfast every morning. 
The daily habits that support getting up early are:
* getting 8 hours of sleep
* meditation before sleep
* no electronic screens 30 min before bed
* reading before bed

To put it all together:
Set your new schedule for your month of waking up earlier and earlier. Now subtract 8 hours. That’s your new bed time. 45 min prior start your bed time routine. 
Turn off electronic screens. Meditate. Read a book. Remind yourself why you’re doing all this and look forward to a healthy breakfast or exercise. 

It also helps. To track your progress to gamify he process. Use theXeffect or actually track your waking time each morning.

Also make sure not to over indulge in the food there while on shift, that could be causing you to go into food comatose lol";2;2.0;[[0.92760838]];[[0.53918517]];-0.8213;0.062;0.7959999999999999;0.14300000000000002;0.7096;0.105;0.868;0.027999999999999997;-0.15799999999999995;-0.19404761904761905;0.12000000000000002;-0.31404761904761896
[Need Advice] How do i stop falling asleep after work;t3_88xm56;3;"I work at McD's. I do drive thru from 7am to 3pm every weekend. When i get home I always try to get my homework and goals for the day done but I'm too tired to stay up and I tend to fall asleep within the hour. This is terrible because it ruins my sleep schedule. I often wake up near or after midnight (like right now; it's 2 am) and do my work then. I don't want to have to keep fixing my schedule over the weekday, only to screw it up again during the weekend. Please help!";1;"Try a different strategy. Like waking up at 3 am to work till u have to go to work and sleeping at 4pm when you get home and have a nutritious meal (ie not mcD’s every day ) In that instance sleeping till midnight or later is actually a good thing. 
One thing Iv learnt is trying to force your body to be alert after a long shift anywhere is super difficult and even a nap wont really help reset you in most cases. 
The point is whatever you try wont last if you don’t make sure that it’s something that your body doesn’t find punishing. Unrealistic schedules burn you out and leave you feeling crappy. 
I used to work night shift at a bank and I had a similar schedule to the one I’m me suggesting I slept 2pm till 11pm; woke up rushed to midnight shift till 7 am and then rushed to varsity for 8am till just after lunch classes most ending before lunch anyways. 
My body adjusted and was happy with that schedule. That why I could sustain it. Find something you can sustain and yes... eating healthy is everything when you try to manage your energy levels during periods of your life that require above average time and effort to be invested. 
Good luck, I hope you find something sustainable that helps you achieve your goals.

[NeedAdvice] Returning to serious martial arts training after long term depression (X-post from /r/Sportspsychology);t3_7wg5u8;6;"Hey ya'll, I'm a 29 yr old male, just made an account on reddit for the first time because I need some help overcoming some mental obstacles in regard to the pain of lost time, lost opportunities, and failing to see the talent I had for what it was and capitalizing on my twenties to bring my skills in combat sports to the levels that they could be. I'm hoping to find someone willing to share their experience or reference to the experiences of professional athletes, fighters in particular, or even other performance based activities in regards to being held back by emotional trauma, depression/anxiety, and life circumstance. Although, I am less interested in cases of injury unless they really stand out or are strongly tied to depression and the like, as these seem to be more easily found. In the following paragraphs I'll detail the specifics of my circumstances, and please don't misunderstand, I don't think I was quite expert level in any broad facet of combat, but the potential was pointed out and/or apparent to me on multiple occasions and I have no intention to brag

I started karate when I was 7, received my black belt at 13 and began teaching at that time, and while I didn't take competition too seriously, I have competed with top level competitors in AAU point sparring, though I was 17 at the time, fighting up in age division(didn't want to wear head gear lololol), though I was definitely a tier or so below them(and lacked height to be top tier without tremendous effort given the advantage offered by reach in point fighting) I definitely had the coordination and skills to expand upon and excel in some facet of combat, with particular interest in MMA. I continued to teach at that school until I left home to continue education in a university city with a feeder community college I attended with the intent of transferring as well as seeing a girl(fall in love, co-dependence...etc..). During that time I fell off any sort of a training regiment, sometimes lifting and then falling off the wagon, never really getting out of shape by normal standards though. Eventually my relationship became emotionally abusive (lies lies lies, manipulating our social circle, isolation...etc...) and after I allowed myself to suffer for a year I finally called it quits. This left me in a haze of suicidal darkness that only this year am I 100% confident in my ability to rise beyond. During this period I realized how long I've been suicidal (first ideations I remember being in 4th grade), how dysfunctional my home life was (alcoholism, gas-lighting mostly, mom has serious childhood trauma that hasn't fully dealt with because, let's just say holy shit, drunk despondent/temperamental dad, don't remember a life lesson that wasn't a funny story about cutting corners or someone being dumber than him), and how my depression/anxiety throughout my life, especially after this relationship, has affected my motivation, discipline, and desire for achievement, as well as my attitude toward those very concepts. I'll leave most details around the nature of my depression/anxiety, trauma, and such to be answered in inquiring comments, but I'll surmise by saying I've also dealt with a lot of abandonment, and repeat exposure to trauma from then till now, giving emotional support to be ghosted upon when I have similar needs by people I considered myself very close to and who postured themselves as being people I could rely on..etc...

After the relationship I mentioned some friends and I got serious with our lifting and I made the biggest athletic gains I've ever made, bringing my squat up from 175x5x3 to 300x5x3(stopped training passed this point) in three months. Unfortunately, I would go through several cycles like this where I would get my lifts, or some aspect of my ability up, but lose out to depression and hopelessness. The instances that really weigh on my mind are the 4 times, 4 years in a row, that I signed up for an MMA gym in Tallahassee. I actually, when I had only been lifting at the time, signed up for the fight team tryouts only knowing about it a day in advance. Only ever having worked jujitsu out of a book, dabbled(like, barely) with boxing and kickboxing and having lifted a heavy squat and dead lift the previous day managed to get on the fight team, with huge compliments to my striking(the dude holding pads stopped and looked me in the eye after my first punch commented that my explosiveness was totally uncommon in Amateur MMA) and some some well deserved condescension toward my grappling and level of conditioning. I basically got in on my striking and not giving up despite my total exhaustion. I only went for two weeks before getting sick and then not picking it back up despite having paid 3 months in advance. During the 2-3 weeks I did train I was also asked if I was a judo black belt, which they assumed as their judo instructor struggled to take me down(till he really ""turned it on""). A funny aside, they would actually warn students who were I think overall better than me in judo/takedowns about my skills, only for me to stalemate till I attempted a takedown myself. For some reason takedown defense is very intuitive to me, up to a certain level i would assume, anyway. I even ran into that instructor later when working on a remodel and he encouraged me to come back in and train, stating that I was quite good for it. I did train there again, twice, in two subsequent following years after breakups, standing out among participants only to fall off shortly after starting. It's the pang of loss I felt in my gut when these memories popped into my head that prompted me to write this.

Eventually I'm where I'm at now, I've been teaching a friend striking consistently for 6 months now to get my head back in the game in, we're matting out his garage so we can spar, hanging bags so we can do the real work, etc... I've made great stride and continue to do so in staying disciplined given that this struggle is essentially reflected in my career as well, and therefore finances/stability, although I am also making strides here as well. I've been looking forward to participating in local MMA once I have insurance I'll be returning to the previously mentioned MMA school, however, today it really hit me how much it hurts to think about the lost time and opportunities as my desire to train and fight and teach has risen. At this age, to pursue to the fullest of my ability I have to be able to be honest about my potential, act without unnecessary hesitation and capitalize on what's still in front of me, and this process is one that rubs right against and confronts directly these memories that flaunt a past wealth I could not see. And so, as I said earlier I would appreciate anybody's shared experiences or the references to the experiences of others that might offer me insight into overcoming and coping with the grief of lost time, as well as the struggle of trying to participate at relatively high level this late in the game.

[NeedAdvice] Returning to serious martial arts training after long term depression (X-post from /r/Sportspsychology);t3_7wg5u8;6;"Hey ya'll, I'm a 29 yr old male, just made an account on reddit for the first time because I need some help overcoming some mental obstacles in regard to the pain of lost time, lost opportunities, and failing to see the talent I had for what it was and capitalizing on my twenties to bring my skills in combat sports to the levels that they could be. I'm hoping to find someone willing to share their experience or reference to the experiences of professional athletes, fighters in particular, or even other performance based activities in regards to being held back by emotional trauma, depression/anxiety, and life circumstance. Although, I am less interested in cases of injury unless they really stand out or are strongly tied to depression and the like, as these seem to be more easily found. In the following paragraphs I'll detail the specifics of my circumstances, and please don't misunderstand, I don't think I was quite expert level in any broad facet of combat, but the potential was pointed out and/or apparent to me on multiple occasions and I have no intention to brag

I started karate when I was 7, received my black belt at 13 and began teaching at that time, and while I didn't take competition too seriously, I have competed with top level competitors in AAU point sparring, though I was 17 at the time, fighting up in age division(didn't want to wear head gear lololol), though I was definitely a tier or so below them(and lacked height to be top tier without tremendous effort given the advantage offered by reach in point fighting) I definitely had the coordination and skills to expand upon and excel in some facet of combat, with particular interest in MMA. I continued to teach at that school until I left home to continue education in a university city with a feeder community college I attended with the intent of transferring as well as seeing a girl(fall in love, co-dependence...etc..). During that time I fell off any sort of a training regiment, sometimes lifting and then falling off the wagon, never really getting out of shape by normal standards though. Eventually my relationship became emotionally abusive (lies lies lies, manipulating our social circle, isolation...etc...) and after I allowed myself to suffer for a year I finally called it quits. This left me in a haze of suicidal darkness that only this year am I 100% confident in my ability to rise beyond. During this period I realized how long I've been suicidal (first ideations I remember being in 4th grade), how dysfunctional my home life was (alcoholism, gas-lighting mostly, mom has serious childhood trauma that hasn't fully dealt with because, let's just say holy shit, drunk despondent/temperamental dad, don't remember a life lesson that wasn't a funny story about cutting corners or someone being dumber than him), and how my depression/anxiety throughout my life, especially after this relationship, has affected my motivation, discipline, and desire for achievement, as well as my attitude toward those very concepts. I'll leave most details around the nature of my depression/anxiety, trauma, and such to be answered in inquiring comments, but I'll surmise by saying I've also dealt with a lot of abandonment, and repeat exposure to trauma from then till now, giving emotional support to be ghosted upon when I have similar needs by people I considered myself very close to and who postured themselves as being people I could rely on..etc...

After the relationship I mentioned some friends and I got serious with our lifting and I made the biggest athletic gains I've ever made, bringing my squat up from 175x5x3 to 300x5x3(stopped training passed this point) in three months. Unfortunately, I would go through several cycles like this where I would get my lifts, or some aspect of my ability up, but lose out to depression and hopelessness. The instances that really weigh on my mind are the 4 times, 4 years in a row, that I signed up for an MMA gym in Tallahassee. I actually, when I had only been lifting at the time, signed up for the fight team tryouts only knowing about it a day in advance. Only ever having worked jujitsu out of a book, dabbled(like, barely) with boxing and kickboxing and having lifted a heavy squat and dead lift the previous day managed to get on the fight team, with huge compliments to my striking(the dude holding pads stopped and looked me in the eye after my first punch commented that my explosiveness was totally uncommon in Amateur MMA) and some some well deserved condescension toward my grappling and level of conditioning. I basically got in on my striking and not giving up despite my total exhaustion. I only went for two weeks before getting sick and then not picking it back up despite having paid 3 months in advance. During the 2-3 weeks I did train I was also asked if I was a judo black belt, which they assumed as their judo instructor struggled to take me down(till he really ""turned it on""). A funny aside, they would actually warn students who were I think overall better than me in judo/takedowns about my skills, only for me to stalemate till I attempted a takedown myself. For some reason takedown defense is very intuitive to me, up to a certain level i would assume, anyway. I even ran into that instructor later when working on a remodel and he encouraged me to come back in and train, stating that I was quite good for it. I did train there again, twice, in two subsequent following years after breakups, standing out among participants only to fall off shortly after starting. It's the pang of loss I felt in my gut when these memories popped into my head that prompted me to write this.

Eventually I'm where I'm at now, I've been teaching a friend striking consistently for 6 months now to get my head back in the game in, we're matting out his garage so we can spar, hanging bags so we can do the real work, etc... I've made great stride and continue to do so in staying disciplined given that this struggle is essentially reflected in my career as well, and therefore finances/stability, although I am also making strides here as well. I've been looking forward to participating in local MMA once I have insurance I'll be returning to the previously mentioned MMA school, however, today it really hit me how much it hurts to think about the lost time and opportunities as my desire to train and fight and teach has risen. At this age, to pursue to the fullest of my ability I have to be able to be honest about my potential, act without unnecessary hesitation and capitalize on what's still in front of me, and this process is one that rubs right against and confronts directly these memories that flaunt a past wealth I could not see.

Thanks in advance Reddit";27;"I can relate to the grief of lost time and missed out on potential. This happenened to me very traumatically. The area where I excelled completely defined my self-worth and a mental breakdown left me feeling like my ability was completely robbed of me. And I dealt with severe anxiety and depression for nearly a decade after. It’s still painful to think about sometimes. But here’s the rub: thinking like that is self-reinforcing. You lose more time because you’re feeding your depression. Here’s what I can tell you. When you’re able to push aside and not focus on (literally force yourself to not think that way) the past, you can start making progress in the present. And the best thing about that, is you get satisfaction just from making small steps. This is very empowering and also self-reinforcing. The progress is almost like a high. Set SMART (look up the acronym) goals, stop thinking how you’ve wasted your potential, and when you make progress on those goals, you’ll feel alive and accomplished. Who knows what you could end up accomplishing. I know some brilliant programmers who didn’t start programming until they were 40! It’s never too late to start working towards your life goals. And the progress eliminates the grief. If your anxiety/depression needs medical attention, you should also seek that out and be proactive about treating it. But this sounds like a self worth issue, and I’ve been in your shoes. I was in that dark place for over 10 years. And now? I’ve never felt so alive. And I’m getting close every day. And that taken away the grief. Good luck, man!

Edit: also, google “how to maximize misery.” This was an eye opener for me. I discovered (after the fact) that I had been doing many of the things in that video, and it was contributing significantly to the feeling you’re describing.";1;0.037037037037037035;[[0.98149958]];[[0.63050262]];-0.9192;0.124;0.745;0.131;0.9608;0.171;0.7190000000000001;0.11;-0.06800000000000002;0.06552604802604803;0.06588744588744587;-0.0003613978613978552

[Need Advice] How useful is extremely polished internet research skills for personal use, job use, and general competency?;t3_7wmmox;2;"Hi. I am new to this subreddit and seriously need your advice. Internet research is something that I like and love. I want to understand different perspectives from everyone on how beneficial using the internet can be.  But please, I ask that you keep these ideas/thoughts in mind:

* To reach their fullest potential, people need both truth and love
* Don't confuse what you wish were true, with what is really true

What bothers me, is that internet research is something that anyone can likely learn. I am very passionate about it. But, I feel that I am overvaluing it. How far can internet research take someone in his/her life in the areas of: personal use, job use, and general competency. This is how I research the internet:

When I am looking for a particular topic, I use questions that's part of a thinking tool called the six thinking hats. So if my topic is about people, I ask the questions:

* What information do we have?
* What information do we need?
* What information is missing?
* What questions do we need to ask?
* How do we go about getting the information we need?

To find the information that we have (that is, on the internet), I start with using a keyword research tool to search for long tail keywords. Tools that I use is SeoStack, and the site keywordtool.io.

To find the information that I need, I select the longtail keywords that interest me (and I sometimes use the ranking of that longtail keyword or monthly search volume as a guide). 

Once I have the specific set of longtail keywords that interest me, I collect them and use 2 search engines to search ""hi-and-low."" What I mean by this, I use google (to find the top, high-traffic and search results for a particular keyword), and I use millionshort (to search the bottom, low-traffic and search results for that particular keyword).

Once I visit and compare/cross-reference the websites, I usually look at the html code, to pay attention to the ""keywords"" and ""description"" attributes for more available information--what information do we have?

For any information that is missing, I usually search forums through google, and then popular ones like reddit. 

For what questions do we need to ask, I see what is already available from sites like quora. Youtube is my last source to visit. If I find any new information, I just repeat the whole question processes until I am done collecting the information. There are other books and sources that I use for other kinds of research. For example, the Open Source Intelligence book by Michael Bazell, SEO techniques, etc. If I have to, I do use google search parameters, and operators to fine tune searches. I am a bit knowledgeable with basic terminology like different kinds of queries, and types of searches: transactional queries, informational queries, navigational queries, boolean search, fuzzy logic, term weighting, etc. I broadly view searching the internet into three categories: Search Engine Optimization, Research Designs, and Open Source Intelligence. I just want to see if I am building anything, or if I can go anywhere with this knowledge. Because it seems like I am doing nothing, and can't go anywhere with this. It feels at the end of the day, someone who knows what I like to work on will only say, ""Congratulations, you are now or have become a better person in society."" &gt;_&lt;



";16;"Wow. You could clearly use your internet research skills to find trending topics with low competition and build simple websites. You'll drive a lot of traffic which you can then can monetize or simply enjoy. I am sure you won't have any issues promoting the sites and optimizing them for search engines.

Research skills at *this* level are IMHO very valuable, don't let anyone convince you otherwise. It seems to me that you're not wasting your time, you are acquiring niche and advanced computer skills.

";16;"IMO:
Personal use: highly valuable, yet very undervalued by society. (Similar to manners). Depending on your goals, especially if you have/are going to complete university level work (and even more so in post grad), the ability to answer your own questions rather than waiting for answers is vital, both on your education and the impression your professors have of you. 

Career: again, it depends on what you are looking to do. If you are working in customer service or at a call center, probably not highly important. If you are working in a cutting edge field or as a librarian where one of your responsibilities is to stay up to date with current trends, likely vital. 

Life: Again, beneficial for you as a person; yet not mandated by society. 

Unfortunately, I think that you are asking for generic answers to personal questions from a forum which lacks your perspective.";1;0.0625;[[0.95827734]];[[0.46709125]];0.9955;0.128;0.855;0.017;0.8475;0.096;0.867;0.037000000000000005;0.052000000000000005;0.104660014781966;0.020000000000000004;0.084660014781966
[NeedAdvice] Help with habits and recurring tasks;t3_7yt7l0;3;"I have two questions:

1. Where do you all draw the line between what is a habit and what is a recurring task? In my current system, a lot of things are habits, like brushing my teeth for example, and they are kept in a habit tracker. But then I have a fair number of tasks, recurring tasks like review X for an hour, and I keep those in my todo app. The more I think about it, the more I can't really tell what needs to go where.

2. Where do you draw the line in terms of detail? Right now, I have 18 daily habits, 4 of which are my morning routine. I could just put morning routine there but I lose all detail. For instance, one task is pack my backpack with all the crap I need, and the habit itself serves as a reminder of the things I need so I don't forget. I would have to forgo all that detail. The other side of this is that 18 habits feel like too much.

Do you all have any advice when it comes to keeping these things, habit trackers and todo apps, nice and clean? I think I am falling into the trap of not organizing stuff in a clean way and then getting annoyed with the tool. Maybe someone can point me to examples of workflows people use.

Thanks.

EDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions. I think I know what I want to do.";3;"Subcategories, like the file system in your computer should be. Better to have subcategories for your main categories than to get lost in the mire. I schedule my to do list in one app, and place reminders on them for the date they are due (like bills, for instance, and they get their own category) or the date I would benefit from getting them done by. That’s the tricky one, if it’s not due, my inattention wants to excessively reschedule, so be realistic but firm.

As far as having two tracking apps, I use my calendar for the second. This is for all *appointments only*, whether self-care, business or personal business appointments. 

TL;DR: use wide and shallow categories/subcategories. Be specific with tasks and realistically firm with due dates.

EDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions. I think I know what I want to do.";3;"I tend to only keep track of habits that I'm working on building, not ones that have been established (brushing teeth).

That's only a general rule though, the way I see it, the importance of tracking habits is either to (1) build it or (2) reflect on it and see where it can be improved.

So if a habit is solidly in place and there is no real need to keep track of it, then what's the point of tracking? Hence why I don't track things such as showering or brushing my teeth. 

You can also do what is called anchoring habits/tasks together, so when you pack yoru backpack in the morning, what is usually the next thing you do in the routine?

Chunk those things together and over time you will do it effortlessly and you can then just call it morning routine so you don't forget the details. It's all in your head, you automatically know oh yeah just pack bag, then X, then Y, then Z and off to the races";1;0.33333333333333337;[[0.96567293]];[[0.6152507]];0.9281;0.125;0.815;0.06;0.7839;0.057999999999999996;0.93;0.013000000000000001;0.02;0.17293650793650794;-0.0375;0.21043650793650795

The enviornment and the atmosphere gets you into a mode that's productive.

If I were you I'd try to create a space, a clean desk at least. That at that space I always do work. That would help.

If you can't do that even a routine it could be anything idk. You just need to build a habit up that's all. Every day you do it you build a good habit, every day you put it off you're reinforcing your bad habit.

Google ""ADHD self test online"" - there's a ton of quick ones, and they can help ascertain whether you may indeed need to seek a professional diagnosis.  If this appears to be the case, your first step is to seek a referral with a psychiatrist (NOT a psychologist, not a therapist) who can diagnose you and assist with developing a treatment plan.

Workouts can seem impossible to stick to if you don’t have a couple things in mind:

1) Why you want to get in shape:

Some people want to be more attractive, some want to be healthier, for me it was a career requirement. Find the reason why it is most important to you and keep that in mind.

2) Pick your goals:

Are you looking for strength, cardio, flexibility, or a little of each? What specific muscle groups do you want to work on? You can usually figure out what a specific activity or goal requires you to work on, but you can also google what muscles are used for various activities.

3) Reps/Time:

Some people work best with pre-set numbers and weights for their reps, often increasing them over a set amount of time. Others simply set aside a time of day to work out and do whatever they want within that time. For cardio specifically, people often set parameters by either distance (I want to run 2 miles), pace (I want to run 2 miles in 20 minutes), or total time (I want to run nonstop for 20 minutes straight).

4) Measuring Progress:

There are many ways to measure progress based on what your goals are (weight loss, muscle gain, endurance, heart rate/BP, appearance, flexibility). Keep in mind what measure most accurately reflects change for your goal and methods. If you want to be able to play soccer without getting winded, maybe you should measure how much longer you’re able to run, or how quickly you recover from being sore. 

5) Admiring Results

You’ve come this far. You deserve to recognize that. Keep in mind how long you’ve been working on this (I’ve been going to the gym steady for three months!) or how great you’re coming along (wow, this shirt looks so baggy now!). Don’t be afraid to discuss your goals and progress (with a trainer, with a spouse, over a fitting subreddit). This reinforces your behavior and holds you responsible to keep working on it.

Total Example:
I want to get in shape for my career, which requires physical fitness. If I don’t succeed, I don’t get the job. Pretty motivating.

My goals are to get to a healthy weight and improve my strength and endurance. 

I put together a workout to optimize this: cardio warm-up, strength training targeting areas I need the most, then cardio again to get my heart rate up and burn some calories.

I set time goals for the cardio to begin with so I wasn’t pressured by speed. I wanted to run for 15 minutes straight. For weights, I did lower weight/higher # reps (for muscle endurance, not bulk).

I measured progress by increasing my run time and weight amounts. Then I noticed that my clothes were fitting more loosely and I wasn’t sore as much or for as long as before. 5 months in, I am 15 lbs down but have gained about 5 back in muscle mass. I can run 30 minutes straight (that’s huge for me). All of my machine weight settings have increased by 15-25 lbs.

I’m by no means a fitness guru but from someone who never had a successful workout until now, it’s amazing that I finally found what worked.

Also start meditating. Read the book 10% Happier. It will give you everything you need. The guy that wrote it is a TV news anchor who literally had a panic attack live on TV (you can find the video. Search for Dan Harris panic attack). 

After that he went on this amazing journey to find out what the fuck is wrong with him and it’s culminate in this amazing book and his great podcast, also called 10% Happier. It’s great. 

Also, don’t drink any caffeine, drink decaf coffee like I do (although I just stopped that because I realized that acidic food and drinks don’t go well with ADHD medicine). 

Change your diet as well to cut out processed carbs and sugar. This makes a massive difference to your brain. Check out the YouTube channel “What I’ve Learned” and watch the sugar videos.

[NeedAdvice] I always feel lazy and unproductive;t3_7xq9un;2;"It's been months now that I always try to make some improvements but due to certain circumstances, including my attitude and mentality; things mostly go back to zero. 

Basically the things I'm trying to improve on are:

* Severe Internet Addiction

* Study Habits

* Social Anxiety

* Health/Fitness

Let's start with my Internet addiction and study habits since both of them are connected. The thing is that I'm always using my phone, laptop, desktop; anything that can access the internet and I always browse facebook, 4chan, and reddit when I'm bored. The worse offender is that the things I've browsed on facebook are stupid and clickbait articles. And in the end when I'm doing nothing, it always goes down to being unproductive. I've always said to myself that try to read my backlog of books that I've been collected since I was an avid reader back then but the habit has been wavering these past few years. And its been affecting my life, especially my studies; every time when exam week is near, I've always do the same thing, browse the internet and not studying at all. (“Why not just use the laptop or phone” but most of the study materials are being presented in a powerpoint presentation. So the uses of gadgets are necessary.) And not just that, since I always travel 1 hour to go to school, after going home; and exhausted, I just throw my bag somewhere and immediately lie on the bed and just grab my phone to browse then the idea of studying will just slip my mind. I really need to fix my study habits since I SUCKED at mathematics and memorization and I'm trying to get an engineering course next year in college. 

And now for my social anxiety its been a long problem of mine since I was in elementary. Maybe due to being born a single child, I've always been a loner type; preferring to solve my own problems my way, and having a limited group of friends. And I'm always the type of guy who would just go with flow if I'm with my friends, rarely voicing out my opinion and ALWAYS conscious what others think of me, which is something like “if I do this, would this person be offended? Etc.”  It's like I don’t have a backbone to make decisions of my own, like I'm afraid of making risks, afraid of going out of my comfort zone because I'm afraid of what would the people think if I do this kind of thing. For example: when I go to gym, I don’t like when there’s lot of people since it makes me feel that I might being judged if I performed a wrong type of exercise, etc. And I also not comfortable of being given a challenge or responsibility, instead of making it as my motivation it becomes something like an annoyance.

And lastly as for my fitness, it is really my goal to be physically fit because of my mother’s family side, most of them are all obese and I don’t think it will do good for me in the long run to remain fat. And if you’re asking for my eating habits, I've been controlling it lately but because of school and my schedule, you can say that I might be losing control of the food I am eating. Basically what I planned is that I eat a big breakfast since if in case I don’t take lunch, at least I can go through the day. But I generally avoid dinner as much as possible. And sometimes or maybe it might be just placebo effect, not eating lunch might affect my performance throughout the day. Its just I don’t know what to do… I don’t even know on how to tell if I'm hungry or just me telling to eat some food because I'm bored. 


**tl;dr**

* I can't study properly because of Internet addiction

* I have social anxiety because I'm afraid of getting outside of my comfort zone

* While for my health/fitness, I can't maintain my eating patterns due to my school schedule. ";21;"It's hard to start or stop multiple habits all simultaneously. Maybe you should focus on creating one new habit at a time instead of trying to spend your willpower in four different directions.

**tl;dr**

* I can't study properly because of Internet addiction

* I have social anxiety because I'm afraid of getting outside of my comfort zone

* While for my health/fitness, I can't maintain my eating patterns due to my school schedule. ";21;"* **Internet addiction:** Lots of tools out there. I personally can vouch for ""Blockit"" and ""StayFocusd"" extensions on Chrome. Give yourself about an hour or so every day. Mobile is trickier. If you have an Android, I think there are blockers for that. iPhone doesn't allow detailed blocking, but Freedom (app) does a decent job of blocking specific apps.

* **Social Anxiety**: This is one of those things that takes practice and exposing yourself to situations. Because I grew up an immigrant, I wasn't accustomed to many of the social cues and social norms in Canada, and had to ""learn as I go"". My family also didn't teach me much quite frankly, so everything from small talk to kissing people on the cheek as a hello were skills I had to learn through trial and error. There's no easy fix for it. I'd reccomend getting a job as that is the easiest way to get used to being around people, uncomfortable situations, and making small talk. I think you, like me, are in your head a lot and need to get used to connecting with the external world more. Don't rely on books etc unless its for specific events (e.g., how to act at a cocktail party, etc.). Again, getting a job, joining a team or group will force you to embrace your awkwardness.

* *[FYI - I grew up without being taught the ""hello"" cheek kiss; its not in my culture. At the company I work at, our formal events asre filled with French Canadians who typically say hello in this manner. Because I wasnt used to it, I had to deal with some real awkwardness the first couple of times people reached to do the double cheek hello. But after fucking up 2-3 times, I got the hang of it and am fairly comfortable with it now.]*

* **Health/Fitness:** I struggle with this as well but did it consistently when I was in University. In fact, I am here to tell you that it is the easiest thing to do while in school (I assume you're past high school) because you can create your own schedule; its much harder when you're working full time. Either way, I'd pick a time to work out that works for you. Personally, I like working out 9-10 PM, and then showering and having half an hour to catch up on social media and then going to sleep. 

In terms of eating, I think don't overthink it, just eat as much as you can, when you can. Set reminders on your phone, etc. Sometimes these steps are necessary until you get the hang of it.

Hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.";5;0.2380952380952381;[[0.98855966]];[[0.73867761]];-0.9186;0.08;0.823;0.098;0.9921;0.128;0.826;0.046;-0.1;-0.034134471398622336;0.05791666666666667;-0.092051138065289

You need to get into a different routine besides being stuck in bed watching life pass by. Willpower? Fatigue? Sugar level? Thats all bullshit. You need to take action to see the change you want. 
Lift 3-4 times a week over a month and you will notice changes with yourself. Thats called confidence. Now it ain't going to happen overnight but that confidence will build bit by bit. Carry that momentum into other areas of your life while increasing your workout bit by bit. Next, look more inward with yourself and ask: ""What am I good at?"" Get a job that at least relates to your answer. You'll start getting a steady stream of income. Oh whats that called again?
 Yeah, confidence. You'll get more of it. Continue that momentum again and eventually, you'll realize that you're LIVING life and not on your bed complaining about some damn sugar blood test.

Clean up your house. Not everything. Just pick a surface and clean it off. Our kitchen table seems to attract everything that doesn’t have a “place”. So what you do is look at everything that is there, pick up one object and don’t put it down until it is in its place. That means either putting it in the spot that it belongs or throwing it away if it has no spot. Just do this with 5 objects right now. Work on more later. 

So if it’s a magazine, throw it away or put it where you keep your magazines. If it’s a shirt, put it in the dirty clothes or hang it up. If it’s a glass, wash it and put it away. 

Keep doing this until your whole house is clean and everything has its own place. You have no idea how great this will make you feel. I’m in the process right now if doing something I do every 3-4 months where I’ll go room by room and pull everything down and put it on the floor and then decide what is the best place for this object, and if I don’t need it, it goes away.

Motivation is a *feeling* that comes and goes. What sort of results has relying on motivation brought you?

Discipline is a *skill* that is cultivated. 

Most people don't take the time to build discipline, because it involves doing difficult/uncomfortable things on a daily basis.

Don't be one of those people.

The fact that you made this post, gives me hope that you're not.

Start small. Build up.

In terms of cultivating discipline, give it a Google.

It will take an hour of your time.

Think of 3-5 different ways you could Google it. Open 1-3 different web pages from each result.

E.g

- how to build discipline
- why is discipline better than motivation
- how to build the habit of studying

Etc etc.

You'll have 3-15 web pages open.

You've gathered your resources. Take a deep breath, and be in the mindset of skimming relevant text. Not reading each article word for word.

Get a pen and paper, and be prepared to write notes.

By the end of this hour, you should have made some notes on how to be disciplined, relevant to your situation.

This is your how/why.

Next, **you** need to turn that into an action point.

What is something **you** can do today, tomorrow, and each day next week that follows your how/why's you've gathered?

Think of this like an experiment. You're giving this whole ""discipline"" thing a try.

I wonder how it will feel after a week of doing it? I wonder how much progress you might make? I wonder how it would differ than relying on motivation?

Find out. Good luck.

I used my brain to get through high school with almost no effort and with good grades. But it has a downside; it spoils you, it makes you think that life will always be easy. It’s not gonna be. You need to think for yourself if it’s worth struggling a little in the present, than struggle a lot in the future. If you start expanding your knowledge on whatever topic or field you like, you will find out that it’s actually a pleasant task to do instead of ‘boring studying’. I was unmotivated to do anything related to Computer Science even though I love the course and want to be a successful developer one day, but then I decided to stop playing video games all day long and devoted some time on my studies and extra activities (related to my field of course) that I found interesting. It all comes down to that decision. I’ve been wasting my life for so long, when I could be so much better at programming than I am now.  Create yourself a to-do list for every week, or set goals with reasonable deadlines to boost your motivation and try to stick to those tasks. All that helped me is time management and determination to be the best version of me that I can be. That’s how I got disciplined. Same goes for every aspect of life and not just career wise.

";65;"I was the same way, and still is to some degree. Looking back now it is so clear to me what was wrong; I never really thought through my life. I just kinda floated along without any long term goal. This made me prone to procrastination, drinking/partying and seeking immediate pleasures.. 

I sat down and wrote down my ideal future and it has been really helpful. Just doing that was a big step in the right direction for me as I became much more aware of when I was doing something that contributes positively to my life or when I was doing something that was negative for my future. 

I still procrastinate, but it's much less than before and when I do I am aware of it and it pains me more than before. 

I would really recommend the Jordan Peterson approach for setting goals life goals;

";65;"You are the younger me that I wish I could go back in time and shake the hell out of.

My background is very similar: I was in a Talented and Gifted program in middle school. I wound up at a new school that didn't have that program. I was academically ahead of everyone else and school became easy. I didn't have to work, so I didn't. Didn't do homework, barely studied. I coasted through, doing just well enough on tests to prove I knew the subject. I scored a 32 on my ACT. I was accepted into my ""dream college""...3rd best school in the country for my major and damned hard to get into.

I got my ass kicked in college. And then later again in my career.

It took me a long time to realize why: my mindset was way, way off and I needed to get beyond the thought of ""ugh, I just need motivated"" and actually employ some discipline for once in my life.

I had a belief that everything just happened for me; that I was a ""natural."" I'm smart because my dad is smart and he somehow passed that on. Other kids were gifted at sports; I was gifted with intellect. It's who I am.

Not true. None of it. And it set me down an awful path of laziness and arrogance. It got me nearly kicked out of college. I've been fired more than once. Lost a couple of friends.

But the biggest problem living like this is that I was aimless without plans and goals. Without something to shoot for, I just kind of floated along through life. And that's the absolute worst place to be.

It took me a long time to really figure this out. That the only real success I've had in life happened because I was determined. Because I knew what I wanted and I went all in on it. When I cared and, more importantly, tried. None of it ever happened *to* me, I *made* it happen. I was a terrible high school student with OK grades, but I got into my college of choice. At the time, I thought I got in because I was either lucky or did just enough. Later I realized it was because I was determined and focused. I wanted it.

So here are two things that I'd tell my younger self:

* Start building and sticking to good daily habits. Some of those could be reminders about kicking bad habits. Faster than you can imagine, you'll start feeling bad about not completing a routine for the day (check out Fabulous in the App Store for help with this one; I love it).

* Actually write down your goals (learn how to do SMART goals to hold yourself accountable). Part of your morning routine should be writing down 1-3 things you can do today to move toward them.";3;0.04615384615384615;[[0.98172208]];[[0.74359326]];-0.8420000000000001;0.099;0.7909999999999999;0.11;0.9816;0.13699999999999998;0.7929999999999999;0.071;-0.07700000000000001;0.07958924563091231;0.0822849527016194;-0.002695707070707085

Entering into middle school I began having terrible migraines that took me out of school a lot, and my grades suffered because of the migraines and personal laziness. By high school, I was taking all of the available honors classes available except for math (which I had failed in eighth grade, because I didn't work at it). 

Fast forward right now to my senior year, and I am doing online school because of health reasons. However, I don't think I ever learned how to work at something. I always did just enough when needed, and now I think I just screwed myself into not graduating this year. I've basically put off all the work that I needed to do, and now after a month of extensions I am still very likely going to fail this semester purely because I haven't worked. I don't think I'll even be able to graduate with my friends or my class, which would be super embarrassing. I have three college acceptances that will be voided (I think), and I don't know what's going to happen in the next six months to a year. Kinda feels like my life is ruined, but I know it's all my fault. 

One thing I do know is that I have to change something, and I think that thing is prioritization and discipline. How can I teach myself to work at this late of a time? Do I have to live a monk's life (or try to) to get rid of bad habits? Is this a motivation problem more so than a discipline problem? Anything helps.

";65;"This post is getting on a bit now but my final year of high school is too similar to your situation for me not to post a reply. Because of ongoing mental health problems I was not able to attend my final year of high school. Instead I did some kind of correspondence course where I went to this wing of a different school, picked up a bunch of booklets, finished them and went back for more whenever I needed to. I had an entire school year to complete four courses, but wouldn't you know it, December came and went without me finishing a single booklet. It got to the point where I had roughly 6 weeks to complete four courses. Like you, I had a University lined up and I didn't want to delay my plans.

So basically the thing that motivated me to make the effort was fear. I didn't want to be left behind so I worked my ass off for 6 weeks and finished the courses. The content of the courses wasn't difficult, it was just incredibly long. Coffee helped. Basically you know what you have to do. Discipline doesn't even have to enter into it because you have a very real piece of motivation in front of you. You know how shitty you will feel if you don't pull yourself together and get it all done, so it's really up to you what you want to do. Waking up early is probably not a bad idea, and I'd especially recommend making work the first thing you do in the morning. If you start the day with half an hour of browsing reddit or playing a video game, work will seem even worse by comparison. Exercise will help keep you from feeling antsy. And that's about all I have for you.

I’m 22m and also was in GT through elementary. I had a drill sergeant for a step dad and he was the only reason I did anything  until he and my mom got a divorce the summer before my freshman year. Skated through high school, which I’m lucky was a joke or I’m not sure about passing. Got a 27 on my ACT without taking that seriously either and proceeded to go to college bc that’s what I was “supposed to do.” Three semesters later I dropped out. I had no idea what I wanted to do and no occupation from getting a degree seemed fulfilling to me. I never failed a course but I hated it, underperformed, and only did what I had to do to pass. Fast forward to 2017 where I’m $20k in debt with nothing to show from it and I hit a low point because I KNOW my potential and consistently never live up to it. I’m the youngest of five and the only boy. My sisters call me the “golden child” and I fuckin hate it because it implies so much expectation. Don’t get me wrong, I really try to be an optimistic person and usually do a good job at it, but after so much failure, it kinda hits you like a rock at some point. I wasn’t depressed but definitely in a rut, and my family and friends asking me if I was depressed wasn’t helping but it did make me reflect and ask if I really might be. My sister who suffered from depression at my age was adamant about me talking to a professional because she didn’t want me to go through the same things she did. So I reluctantly agreed in November. Turns out, depression has many overlapping symptoms with ADD, which blew my mind because I thought it was just focus oriented. Now I never tried to pity myself, claiming I had ADD because everybody’s scatter brained to a degree right? I just thought it was another excuse for myself. The doc prescribed me vyvanse, which I’ve been on for two months now and it’s been crazy how much has turned around for me. I’m still in progress like I’ll always be, but I’ve come so much farther in the last two months than I did in the last two years. I hate the feeling of helplessness that comes with this notion, but there was truly something beyond my control that capped my performance well under my potential. I do want to get off the meds as soon as possible though, which I think once I establish the necessary habits in my life, I’ll be able to ween myself off them.

Sorry for the wall of text and I can go further into the overlapping symptoms of ADD &amp; depression or the different ways vyvanse has improved my life if you want. But I urge you to talk to a professional if you think there’s even the slightest possibility you are similar to me in these ways. DM me if you want and I will talk with you or even help you find the resources you need to improve your situation. Nobody can do it alone and there’s people in your life that are more than willing to help, me included. If my sister never had those hard conversations with me, I’d more than likely still be very much in that rut.

[NeedAdvice] Balancing discipline vs burn-out;t3_7vrryg;2;"Hey guys, thanks for reading!

So, I have an ongoing struggle with figuring out how much to push myself before it becomes unproductive. Discipline has always been a huge problem for me. I have ADHD that wasn't diagnosed until my late 20s, which led to depression and anxiety as well. I also have a lot of issues with chronic illness/pain that really sap my energy. 

Those aren't excuses, but they do complicate matters. It's hard to know what's what. In the last few years, I've learned some discipline because I finally had the right set-up for success. However, prior to my early 30s, I pretty much did everything in a cycle of self-hatred and burnout. Depression and chronic pain made me not want to do stuff, but anxiety gave me the little burst of energy needed to get it done. I was exhausted all the time. 

Here's the problem: We all need a balance of rest and self-care in order to perform at our best. But I am so used to shutting off that voice in my head that begs for rest because I don't trust it. For years, I had to force myself to do absolutely everything. Nothing was effortless. I was my own abusive boss: ""Get out of bed, you lazy sack of shit! Now get your stupid ass to work before you get fired!"". Everything was like that all day long. 

Now, I have a lot more discipline, but I still find myself trapped in the cycle of overwork/burnout because I can't differentiate the urge for rest/renewal from the depression that just doesn't want to do anything. I'm constantly forcing myself to do stuff, which makes me wildly productive...right up until I crash for hours or occasionally days at a time. 

If I'm going to the point of burnout, I know this isn't effective. But I can't tell whether I'm just being apathetic or whether I actually need some fun/rest, so I just push through. Obviously, getting help for depression and other mental health issues is a huge part of this problem, so I am seeing a counsellor and a psychiatrist. But it's totally a vicious cycle, because burning out all the time is making it harder to recover from depression. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? What did you do? ";3;"First off, very sorry you are going through this. It's tough. I had a mental breakdown once due to stress and during recovery (which involved major depression) struggled with the same question. How to balance activity with rest? You are absolutely right that depression tells you to do nothing and that is exactly the wrong thing to do when you are depressed. But burn out is very real too and not to be taken lightly. 

So here is my advice. 

Try to group activities into different buckets. Not all activity is the same and it really matters WHAT you do. Much more than exactly HOW MUCH. 

There are a ton of activities that are productive but do not drain you or stress you out... even the opposite, they can be healing: taking a walk, seeing friends, exercising, playing a fun game, stretching while listening to a podcast, meditation, muscle relaxation exercises, reading a book, cooking/eating something healthy. 

Those things should absolutely be considered productive. Build in a lot of those things. It is doing something and helps you in many ways. 

Identify the type of things your depression tells you to do that you know are not helpful, lying in bed without a purpose, browsing the Internet mindlessly, watching TV without a purpose etc. Those things can actively make your depression worse and in a lot of ways do not help rest or heal your body. Browsing the Internet and watching TV is highly stimulating for the brain and the emitting light can worsen the quality of your sleep. 

Speaking of sleep, make it an absolute priority if you are depressed. It is at the very root of depression. Look up circadian entrainment and tweak your lifestyle to get the best sleep possible. Good sleep starts the minute you wake up. 

 When it comes to stressful work and doing things you don't like doing, be super patient and kind with yourself. This is key! You did not chose to be in this situation. Have compassion for yourself. Try to do your best. If you don't feel like doing something (which I imagine is most of the time) just tell yourself you will try the activity for 5-10 min and then take an honest assessment if it is simply too much or if you can keep going. Give yourself praise EVERY TIME you manage to even make a tiny step forward. 

If it is too much, you can feel that your brain is just not working properly, you can't focus, don't get upset, just acknowledge it and then instead of doing a 180 and saying OK then I do nothing, try to think of something to do instead that is less taxing but still ""productive"", it can help to have a list ready where you write down possible things to do. Just go through it and pick something. Make sure you wrote the tasks down in a very actionable way, for example: ""Go outside and walk around for 15m"" or ""Vacuum the floor in bedroom"". The smaller and more specific the steps the more likely you feel like you can do them. 

The other thing is differentiating between things you want to do and things you have to do. While we are depressed we often don't feel like there is anything we want to do, but we do still have preferences or memories of what matters to us. Don't just do a bunch of stuff that you think is productive, but try to prioritize things that actually matter to you on some level.

Depression is a sign that we do not have all our needs met. And some basic human needs are to matter and have some feeling of meaning. Having a passion project has pulled many people out of depression. It was also a strategy I used. I just had an idea of something I wanted to do and worked on it a bit every day. This is a great distraction too, and anything that distracts you from overthinking/negative thoughts will put you on the fast track to recovery. Negative thoughts cause emotional stress, this stress is what your brain needs to process during sleep (REM phase), the more you spend in REM, the less time your body has for deep sleep which recovers your body. So we wake up exhausted and unmotivated. Reducing negative thoughts and emotionally distressing thoughts during the day is key to recover from depression... 

To sum it up, if you feel like resting, make it an active productive rest, not lying in bed. Anything that makes you smile or moves your body etc. 

Also, depending on the type of work, know that how much a human can work (create output) in a day is much lower than most people think. For something strenuous like writing or thinking hard it's about 3-4 hours a day.  So don't put your expectations too high. 

All the best!";2;0.6666666666666667;[[0.98321801]];[[0.79796891]];-0.9961;0.08;0.708;0.212;-0.6573;0.126;0.741;0.133;-0.125;0.03058236808236808;0.13942318594104308;-0.10884081785867501

Plan when you'll work.  Plan when you'll play.  You don't need to specify exactly what you'll do during those blocks of time, and in fact I'd suggest you don't plan it out exactly, but plan blocks of time to do thing.  Then you can work knowing it's time to work and rest knowing it's time to rest.  By making the decisions ahead of time you'll take emotions out of it.  You won't be resting because you just feel like it you'll be resting because it's when you're supposed to.;1;0.33333333333333337;[[0.95942978]];[[0.54278513]];-0.9961;0.08;0.708;0.212;0.4215;0.055;0.9129999999999999;0.032;-0.155;0.03058236808236808;0.25;-0.21941763191763192
[NeedAdvice] Lost my stride and I feel worse than I did before I changed for the better.;t3_81hfxn;13;"Hello Reddit, posting from throwaway as people I know browse reddit and know my situation but I still like to keep things private.

First time posting as well so forgive me any errors I may have in formatting.

This year has really tested me. I have no motivation or willpower to do anything. I always feel guilty about it too, knowing I should be doing something about it. 

I know my goals and things I need to change. But unfortunately, every late attempt to fix it has been met by complacency and no drive to actually stick with it anymore.

This used to not be me, I used to be overweight and very anxious and quiet. After my first year in college though, I decided enough was enough and changed. I changed my body image mentally and physically by working out and sticking to a healthy calorie deficit diet.

Everything was great up until this current year. I’ve lost my stride, my zen, my sense of pride and accomplishment.

I wrote down some notes that I thought would help me visualize my situation after reading some advice from people in similar situations as me.

- Be in an empty relationship
- Have no direction or idea on what I want to do

- was asked if I do photography professionally because of quality of work
- Weather is becoming warmer
- Fun job in creative field
- Body image has been better, I don’t feel disgusting in my own skin
- Opportunity to change to a major I really want to explore

Things I should do but haven’t

- Have willpower
- Be honest with myself about where I’m going in life and the people I associate with right now
- Take initiative

If I didn’t know any better I’d say hat I have the tools to get better, but it’s as if I’m on autopilot mode and don’t want to at all, even if I know deep down I should change.

I am just very lost and feel alone and anxious, causing me to freak out and want to stay in bed and not do anything.

I just need some advice or some sort of reality check because I can’t go on living like this, it’s as if I feel myself descending into madness and complacency.

Please, help.

- Be like last year where I was fearless and up to get out of my comfort zone always.
- Lease apartment to live in next year

What I need to do for all this
- get willpower and mindset
- I don’t know.


If I didn’t know any better I’d say hat I have the tools to get better, but it’s as if I’m on autopilot mode and don’t want to at all, even if I know deep down I should change.

I am just very lost and feel alone and anxious, causing me to freak out and want to stay in bed and not do anything.

I just need some advice or some sort of reality check because I can’t go on living like this, it’s as if I feel myself descending into madness and complacency.

Please, help.
";84;"You're doing way too much. Beating yourself up over every little thing isn't healthy and isn't going to help. What you have set yourself is a full time job, whens the last time you took a break? When was the last time you spent a weekend just having fun not worrying about meditating right or that you haven't written for the assigned amount of time you've set yourself or that you had 100 extra calories that day? 
Life can't be that binary, and you're being way too hard on yourself, you don't even talk positively about the fact you achieved all you did and sticking to those goals for as long as you did, don't you think you deserve some credit for doing it in the first place? Are these things that you even want to do or things you believe you need to do to have a fulfilling life? 
It's like you're sprinting blindfolded, why not take a gentle stroll and take in everything. 
My suggestion? Cut down that list, pick 5 things, small things and take it easy. Life isn't a rush, I'm guessing you're early 20s and you feel everyone is excelling at everything and you're left behind, that's not really how life works, everyone has their own pace and abilities that works for them. Life has ups and downs, that's normal, it's about balance, can you really do all those things for the next 40 years? start with 3 or 5 improvements and go from there
Also, you seem a bit low, try and talk to someone about this, I recommend therapy to anyone I come across but just anyone understanding can help, inbox me if needed.";12;0.14285714285714288;[[0.96827316]];[[0.56468697]];0.9876;0.19;0.6579999999999999;0.152;0.4042;0.065;0.879;0.055999999999999994;0.029000000000000005;0.09945787237453904;0.0837628934851157;0.015694978889423342
[NeedAdvice] Lost my stride and I feel worse than I did before I changed for the better.;t3_81hfxn;13;"Hello Reddit, posting from throwaway as people I know browse reddit and know my situation but I still like to keep things private.

First time posting as well so forgive me any errors I may have in formatting.

This year has really tested me. I have no motivation or willpower to do anything. I always feel guilty about it too, knowing I should be doing something about it. 

I know my goals and things I need to change. But unfortunately, every late attempt to fix it has been met by complacency and no drive to actually stick with it anymore.

This used to not be me, I used to be overweight and very anxious and quiet. After my first year in college though, I decided enough was enough and changed. I changed my body image mentally and physically by working out and sticking to a healthy calorie deficit diet.

Everything was great up until this current year. I’ve lost my stride, my zen, my sense of pride and accomplishment.

I wrote down some notes that I thought would help me visualize my situation after reading some advice from people in similar situations as me.

Here it is:

Things I don’t want to happen in life

- Be broke
- Be in an empty relationship
- Have no direction or idea on what I want to do
- Be distant from family and friends
- Hold grudges for petty things
- Be bad with money
- Be unhealthy and unfit
- Hate my career/job
- Laziness
- Lie and hide emotions

Things I want out of my life

- Happiness
- Travel the world
- Overcome anxiety and worries
- Caring partner that I can 100% be myself with
- A family that I love and provide for
- Adventure without fear
- Be creative in my career
- Own a Tesla
- Own a nice house and an apartment in a city

- Writing
- Meditation
- Guitar
- Gym
- Keeping up with diet
- Hanging out with friends
- Feeling confident
- Wanting to have fun

Things I’ve learned

- I don’t want to waste money and be in debt without reason after college
- I want to greet everyday early, not wake up dreading getting out of bed

- was asked if I do photography professionally because of quality of work
- Weather is becoming warmer

";84;"Hey man, i am in the same boat but a little more than ten years older i think. I had those sentiments around undefined since elementary. Its like you know what to do and feel guilt when you aren't doing it and feel anxious confronting yourself, confronting ""problems"" and you want to forget it all by distracting yourself with whatever you can a hold of or you take an apathetic view. The current slow change of outlook and habits for me now is learning to view that my worth on this Earth is the same as everyone. Learning to love myself. Practicing to love myself by forgiving myself and moving on by doing all the correct things I can without expectations of myself. Just focusing on the little steps and when I faulter, that's okay, I'm human, let's move on, non zéro days. Internalize the fact you have worth in this world like everyone else does on this Earth. With me also I find external support by asking my wife why she thinks I'm awesome.   And mistakes you've made? you're okay, you're human, everyone struggles differently. The negative self talk and views you have of yourself are only truly in your own mind and not legit, just move on. These are the thoughts on my mind nowadays compared to before. But you need to practice. And meditation for me has helped me practice by way of realizing the only truth of anything real is the present moment in front of you. Every moment is a moment of change, you're not what you have seen yourself to be in your past. 

Now I don't really know your thoughts but when you mentioned being fair to girlfriend and self and parents sacrificed too much, those were the things I really noted as being similar to me which I focused on too much in a subtly negative way. 

You're only moving through life for others. Your actions, your results, are for others.  Your grades? You truly only care that you do well so your parents and girlfriend are happy and in turn that makes you happy. Seeing them happy makes you happy because you love them.   You are truly grateful that you are able to be in the position you are in with ppl around you like that. You're lucky to be in this position. You should be grateful and you are. So you should do well in life. Do well for others and in turn, you help yourself. Makes sense right? So you should be fair to yourself and just shape up. ""Why am I such a piece of shit and not able to have the willpower and do what I know is right? I already know!! Why can't I just.. Why? ""

Because deep down you don't care about yourself. You don't love yourself. You don't see your self worth as being equal to others. ""And why should it be equal?? Look at me! I can't even do these things that I know I should be doing!""

This might just all be me talking about myself, but do you view your own life to be worth the same as everyone else around you?  

I have strong negative self talk. And it's largely out of habit from this view that I'm not worth as much as others. And until I am that perfect self vision I have in my mind, I'm still a piece of shit is how I typically felt. Then you focus on your mistakes and get depressed or anxious or whatever and you procrastinate. Even when you've identified and acknowledged that you have negative view like this, you can stop it sometimes and you feel like you don't really have control.

I had focused so much on how I should be a better man for others and truly didn't give a shit about myself.  And realistically, until you see yourself deserving of love, deserving of care, deserving of the ""good"" life you pictured, it's a struggle to do anything. 

Finding a shrink is not a bad idea either. No shrink for me yet but I'm in the process of finding one.  I'm currently going through David Burns feeling good handbook. The cove reminds me of some religion cult. But it's a pretty good resource in categorizing thoughts and feelings so you can rid of them. 

Logically, we are truly equal in terms of worth in this life. And the truest moment is every present moment. Every new second is a new second of change. Every new second is a new life, a new you, a new self that is able to choose to focus on anything. Everyone operates on the same principle. And no one is really doing this ""better"" than anyone else. Better is  relative to whatever we have interpreted. And without that better, your worth is the same. The notion of worth is just a thought not a part of reality as a whole.

- Opportunity to change to a major I really want to explore

Things I should do but haven’t

- Watch finances
- Have willpower
- Be honest with myself about where I’m going in life and the people I associate with right now
- Take initiative
- Be like last year where I was fearless and up to get out of my comfort zone always.
- Lease apartment to live in next year

What I need to do for all this
- get willpower and mindset
- I don’t know.


If I didn’t know any better I’d say hat I have the tools to get better, but it’s as if I’m on autopilot mode and don’t want to at all, even if I know deep down I should change.

I am just very lost and feel alone and anxious, causing me to freak out and want to stay in bed and not do anything.

I just need some advice or some sort of reality check because I can’t go on living like this, it’s as if I feel myself descending into madness and complacency.

Please, help.
";84;"I share a similar story to yours, currently getting my stride back.

Break down the goals into smaller steps

Before you go to bed each night make a list of 10 of the smaller tasks to do (even if one of those tasks is breaking down a goal in to smaller tasks).

Do 3 of the 10 things before noon, aim to do at least 2 more before writing the next days list. Try to have the most daunting task be one of the first three, sometimes I like to knock out a smaller task or two to gain some momentum.

Another thing that's been helping me *immensely* is decluttering. I unsubscribed from all the spam mail I get, I turned off all but the most important notifications, uninstalled all of the games I wasn't currently actively playing, unsubscribed from negative subreddits and timewasting subreddits, etc.. Eventually I will be turning to my physical stuff and decluttering that as well.

I also automated all my bills and savings so the only money on my debit card is the money I can freely spend. Huge weight off my shoulders even if I have less money to spend from putting myself on a budget. 

Not sure if any of this will apply to you but it's been working well for me.";3;0.03571428571428572;[[0.96255185]];[[0.48326866]];0.9876;0.19;0.6579999999999999;0.152;0.7442;0.098;0.841;0.061;0.0010000000000000009;0.09945787237453904;0.05955555555555556;0.039902316818983485

First time posting as well so forgive me any errors I may have in formatting.

This year has really tested me. I have no motivation or willpower to do anything. I always feel guilty about it too, knowing I should be doing something about it. 

I know my goals and things I need to change. But unfortunately, every late attempt to fix it has been met by complacency and no drive to actually stick with it anymore.

This used to not be me, I used to be overweight and very anxious and quiet. After my first year in college though, I decided enough was enough and changed. I changed my body image mentally and physically by working out and sticking to a healthy calorie deficit diet.

Everything was great up until this current year. I’ve lost my stride, my zen, my sense of pride and accomplishment.

I wrote down some notes that I thought would help me visualize my situation after reading some advice from people in similar situations as me.

Here it is:

Things I don’t want to happen in life

- Be broke
- Be in an empty relationship
- Have no direction or idea on what I want to do
- Be distant from family and friends
- Hold grudges for petty things
- Be bad with money
- Be unhealthy and unfit
- Hate my career/job
- Laziness
- Lie and hide emotions

Things I want out of my life

- Happiness
- Travel the world
- Overcome anxiety and worries
- Caring partner that I can 100% be myself with
- A family that I love and provide for
- Adventure without fear
- Be creative in my career
- Own a Tesla

Things I stopped doing

- Writing
- Meditation
- Guitar
- Gym
- Keeping up with diet
- Hanging out with friends
- Feeling confident
- Wanting to have fun

- Cleaning up after myself

Things I’ve learned

- Indifference towards problems (good and bad)

Why I want to change

- I don’t want to waste money and be in debt without reason after college
- I want to greet everyday early, not wake up dreading getting out of bed
- I want to love learning and not be an ignorant individual — parents sacrificed too much to have it be in vain

";84;"I see a lot of lists. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. 
It's good that you're bringing mindfulness to the problems, but bad because it creates a ""big ass wall of stuff I need to do"". 

Firstly and foremost, good fucking job recognizing this bullshit and reaching out for support. You're already ahead of literally millions of people in the same situations. 

You have a lot of goals, you feel defeated. You need a win, pick the easiest thing on those lists and do it, download headspace's beginner meditation app. 

Make a plan, you're a smart guy. Need a video to [light a fire under your ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trUpZbAzNDY)? 

 Remember that all of those habits you want back weren't lost in a day, they also weren't gained in a day. What you have before you is a marathon, not a sprint.  Habits take time to build, be fairer with yourself, show yourself some empathy (If you're not sure how I could write a guide about it). If you can improve your habits by 20% a day for a week, you're doing a crazy amount better than before. 

&gt;Anxiety
If you have a worry-Ask yourself ""Is it real? Can I do anything about it?"". If the answer is no to both of those things dismiss the thought. 

Are you sleeping at normal times? Fixing your sleep schedule can have a massive impact on depression on it's own. Fixing your sleep schedule+Implementing a morning self care routine (morning meditation or yoga or something)=definitely more impact.

You might have a form of depression. I have depression, so I know what it is like. A lot of what you are talking about is very similar to what I feel and experience. 
Depression is not necessary being sad all the time. It can be feeling numb, not caring about what you used to love, lack of concentration, and/or anxiety.
Have you been sleeping too much or too little?
Eating too much or too little?
Changes in weight
Hopelessness
Guilt
General discomfort 
Trouble making decisions 


There is also a smaller chance that it is bipolar disorder, which is when some has periods of highs, like being happy and hyper all the time, and downs, like being depressed. 
Those changes don’t usually happen over a short period of time, like maybe weeks or months of an “episode”

";84;"I want to read more, so I set a goal for 10 pages a day. 

I want to write a book, so I set a goal for 100 words a day. 

Set small expectations, and accept that everyone has bad days. Success isn’t necessarily meant to come from a busy, rushed, filled up life. Take time for yourself and take time to do what you love.  Create things without caring whether the outcome sucks or not. 

And most importantly, you’re almost there with the indifference to problems. But not quite. Indifference implies that you’re ignoring or not addressing the issues. Try framing it as not resisting. Don’t resist bad feelings, let them pass. Accept the situation you’re in without saying ‘what if’ or ‘I wish it was different’. Acceptance doesn’t mean you can’t strive to be better, but accepting your present means that you’re not postponing your happiness until you’ve achieved enough to deserve it. 

Am I even close to where I want to be right now? No. But I’m content with where I am, which gives me the patience to enact slow and sustainable change, instead of overloading myself, burning out, and sinking into a slump again ";1;0.011904761904761904;[[0.98109337]];[[0.70894193]];0.9876;0.19;0.6579999999999999;0.152;-0.2387;0.11800000000000001;0.779;0.10300000000000001;0.02300000000000001;0.09945787237453904;0.08116071428571428;0.01829715808882476

";84;"Your seeing your goals as things you have to achieve. 

You don’t have to achieve anything. You don’t have to do anything. That’s a fact and your language needs to reflect this. 

See your goals as things you want to do, which they are.  Get out of routine. You’ve categorised yourself immensely. 

You have nothing to prove to yourself or anybody. Think why you do things. 

When you have free time just sit for a while and talk to yourself. As yourself why you’re doing what your doing. Where you want to be. Even if it gets comfortable try to fathom an answer. 

You seem to have a lot o interest which can be hard to keep practicing and engaging in while studying. Stop your routines. In your spare time see what you feel like doing, at the moment it seems like smoking and playing video games. But think what you’d really want to be doing, not as an escape but for progressing into the future. Even if that means something not on your list. Over time see which activities you keep doing and want to take further and a routine will naturally develop. 

Of course that’s easier said than done. Especially while studying. But first realise and get out the precept you don’t have to do anything. You’re not defined.

[NeedAdvice] Lost my stride and I feel worse than I did before I changed for the better.;t3_81hfxn;13;"Hello Reddit, posting from throwaway as people I know browse reddit and know my situation but I still like to keep things private.

First time posting as well so forgive me any errors I may have in formatting.

This year has really tested me. I have no motivation or willpower to do anything. I always feel guilty about it too, knowing I should be doing something about it. 

I know my goals and things I need to change. But unfortunately, every late attempt to fix it has been met by complacency and no drive to actually stick with it anymore.

This used to not be me, I used to be overweight and very anxious and quiet. After my first year in college though, I decided enough was enough and changed. I changed my body image mentally and physically by working out and sticking to a healthy calorie deficit diet.

Everything was great up until this current year. I’ve lost my stride, my zen, my sense of pride and accomplishment.

I wrote down some notes that I thought would help me visualize my situation after reading some advice from people in similar situations as me.

Here it is:

Things I don’t want to happen in life

- Be broke
- Be in an empty relationship
- Have no direction or idea on what I want to do
- Be distant from family and friends
- Hold grudges for petty things
- Be bad with money
- Be unhealthy and unfit
- Hate my career/job
- Laziness
- Lie and hide emotions

Things I want out of my life

- Happiness
- Travel the world
- Overcome anxiety and worries
- Caring partner that I can 100% be myself with
- A family that I love and provide for
- Adventure without fear
- Be creative in my career
- Own a Tesla
- Own a nice house and an apartment in a city
- Diet and exercise
- Structure
- Discipline
- Start a business w/ colleagues for fun
- Have parents see their grandkids graduate college
- Be a helpful human being
- Photograph meaningful events to remember
- Have a dog

Distractions I have

- Video Games
- Laziness
- Anxieties
- Loneliness
- Girlfriend
- Weed
- Porn

Things I stopped doing

- Writing
- Meditation
- Guitar
- Gym
- Keeping up with diet
- Hanging out with friends
- Feeling confident
- Wanting to have fun
- Communicating ideas and creative thoughts
- Cooking
- Cleaning up after myself

Things I’ve learned

- Indifference towards problems (good and bad)
- Nothing will happen unless you do it
- It’s okay to say no, nobody should make me feel guilty
- Organization and discipline is a step by step process

Why I want to change
- I feel as though this isn’t the real me
- It’s not fair to My girlfriend or me to not be in it 100%
- I hate how it feels to not accomplish anything
- I don’t want to waste money and be in debt without reason after college
- I want to greet everyday early, not wake up dreading getting out of bed
- I want to love learning and not be an ignorant individual — parents sacrificed too much to have it be in vain

Great things that have happened lately

- was asked if I do photography professionally because of quality of work
- Weather is becoming warmer
- Fun job in creative field
- Body image has been better, I don’t feel disgusting in my own skin
- Opportunity to change to a major I really want to explore

Things I should do but haven’t

- make appointment to discuss major change
- Apply to internships
- Watch finances
- Have willpower
- Be honest with myself about where I’m going in life and the people I associate with right now
- Take initiative
- Be like last year where I was fearless and up to get out of my comfort zone always.
- Lease apartment to live in next year

What I need to do for all this
- get willpower and mindset
- I don’t know.


If I didn’t know any better I’d say hat I have the tools to get better, but it’s as if I’m on autopilot mode and don’t want to at all, even if I know deep down I should change.

I am just very lost and feel alone and anxious, causing me to freak out and want to stay in bed and not do anything.

I just need some advice or some sort of reality check because I can’t go on living like this, it’s as if I feel myself descending into madness and complacency.

Please, help.

It's been 51 days since I decided to beat my depression and anxiety. I couldn't deal with my suicidal tendencies anymore, I ended up dropping out of university as a result. I'm 19 years old now, suffer(ed)ing from post concussion syndrome, a severe family history of mental illness and suicidal/depression feelings from the age of 8. 

I'm incredibly introverted, though provoke altercation. In the early fall my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. For the past year and a half my dad was unemployed due to change in economy. I've had several full on fights with my dad, though things seem fine now that he realized I was eager to fight back. 

On December 16th I tried to commit suicide for the 8th time, and it was the first time the failed attempt was unexplainable and had repercussions to a relationship I heavily valued. That night I vowed to beat this shit (pardon my language) and went 45 days without a single suicidal thought, let alone action. Then I relapsed(?). Out of the blue I was getting a midnight snack and out loud said ""it would be better off if I was dead"".  I've been back in a funk since, but no where near where I was. 

I want to beat this thing, and after bitter experiences with several therapists I chose to beat it myself.  Using stubbornness (thanks mom), and addictive personality I had managed to get the ball going by buying a whiteboard to have goals, due dates, etc and by appreciating more little things. I feel like since I'm starting from the bottom I should build a foundation of habits to start to rewrite my brain on.

TLDR:Sorry for the long post, I'm just trying to find habits";1;"Hi b3grubb, I don't really have the answer, but want to show my support. Your post is really courageous and I'm sure you're going to beat your demons. 

I used to struggle a lot with depression, and at some point I realised that I'm not the failure I thought I was. I didn't need to hate myself. If I could forgive and love myself, I can help others as well. I still have moments but in general I win that battle a little bit more everyday. 

As for discipline, I find my source of strength in friends and this will to win. Life is short and then nothing for a very long time, so I'm going to make it count. I know you will too. 

For jolts of motivation, I just listen to cheesy motivation videos on YouTube. 

Good luck! Rooting for you.

TLDR:Sorry for the long post, I'm just trying to find habits";1;"Hey there!
Sounds like you've been having a hard time. But you've made it this far. You're here right now, and that is what counts.

Regarding your question, don't rely on motivation. Motivation is nice, it feels nice to be pumped up about doing something. But motivation is also fickle. You can't summon it when you need it most. It comes and goes of its own volition. So don't rely on it. Use it when it's there. Let it lie when it's not.

You're on the right course already. You've said it three times in your post: habit. That's all you need to get going. Successfully building new habits is hard, however. I've been fighting the motivation &amp; procrastination battle a long time. What has finally worked for me is simply this: 5 minutes a day. I want to play the guitar for 5 minutes a day. If I manage to do that, I can mark the day as successful. I'm on day 92 today, so that's three months of playing the guitar daily.

And here's the best thing: Action breeds motivation and inspiration. When I pick up my guitar and start playing, I usually play a lot longer than just 5 minutes. As soon as I have momentum I want to keep it.

And finally: Start small. You can't go from 0 to 100 in an instant. That's way too overwhelming. Thinking ""Alright, just 5 minutes of playing the guitar and I'm done for the day"" is a lot easier than ""Alright, I need to play the guitar for 2 hours, practice drawing for 2 hours, hit the gym for 2 hours and ..."". You get the gist I guess. Keep the resistance to what you want to do as low as possible. By now I have adopted drawing daily as well. Again, just 5 minutes. But it works for me.";1;1.0;[[0.96776855]];[[0.59756596]];-0.9442;0.092;0.772;0.136;0.9791;0.14400000000000002;0.8;0.055999999999999994;-0.132;0.060379464285714286;0.19517149517149515;-0.13479203088578087
[NeedAdvice] How can I teach myself to be disciplined and not overly rely on motivation and emotion?;t3_81udx2;5;"Hi everyone, 

The last post I made, I felt like I hadn't properly explained myself the way I intended to. Not that I said anything particularly offensive; I rambled and hadn't truly gotten my point across. 

So...

2016 hadn't been the best year in my life; though last year was definitely the start of me focusing on myself and what I needed. Now, for 2018, I'd like to put those aspirations into actions. 

I intend to improve my lifestyle by implementing a wide array of habits along the way. 

* **EMOTIONAL/MENTAL** - I would like to be in a place where I have much stronger confidence in myself. To look in the mirror and find beauty, to look deep inside myself and *know* that I am a good person is where I want to be.
*Habits to Implement* - Daily yoga and meditation; preferably early in the morning, where the sun's rising and people are still sleeping. Journaling almost every night before I go to bed would also be a nice habit to implement. 

* **OCCUPATIONAL** - I'm currently job hunting, and since I'm in school full-time, it'd best suit me to look for a part-time position. I'd also like to have a side hustle and save as much as possible.
*Habits to Implement* - I definitely need to build a much stronger work ethic overall, and just always stay productive, generally speaking. 

* **SOCIAL** - I'd like to be more friendly and outgoing, especially towards other people. I've always been pretty shy for the longest time, and feel that at my age, having a solid group of close friends would definitely add to my life. That, and I'm also tired of acting awkward all the time towards people. It'd be nice for me to get out of my house once in a while; being a homebody has gotten old after a while for me.
*Habits to Implement* - As someone with a diagnosed anxiety disorder, CBT workbooks have provided great use for me, but I'm the absolute worst at staying consistent.

* **PHYSICAL**- This year, I'd like to tone up and obtain a toned body, overall.
*Habits to Implement* - I've found that I work best doing all my workouts in the morning, as I don't have to worry about people going in and out, ~~which admittedly makes me pretty self-conscious~~. But it's also the hardest thing for me to do, for a couple reasons. 

* **INTELLECTUAL** - As I mentioned earlier, I'm currently a full-time student. I completely bombed my classes last semester, so I'm taking just a couple courses this time around. So far, so good, but I'm just afraid I'm going to fall off the wagon like I've done in the past.
*Habits to Implement* - I want to be able to study, without giving into temptations to just 'monkey' around and dance. This is especially hard, as I also have ADD as well, and though I take medication for it, I still struggle to stay focused. I also want to make it a habit to read more often, especially right before I go to bed. 



The main issues I have in implementing these said habits are a number of things:

* unstable sleep schedule (instead of my bedtime being 10:30pm to 6:30am, I'll fall asleep at, like 2, 3, 4 in the morning, and wake up sometime in the afternoon. 

* procrastination 

* wanting to have fun first and not put in as much work, if not more on the things that truly matter. 

* I have a VERY poor work ethic...it's pretty sporadic

I want to be able to live on my own, hold down a job, make close friends, do well in school and just have a more welcoming, friendly vibe to myself. But I'm constantly holding myself back 'cause I hadn't put in the work. I remember all the people during college who went out and not only had an active social life, but also did well in all their classes, volunteered, work a part-time job and managed to look put together throughout the whole process. While, admittedly, they made me feel envious, I was also left wanting to perform to the best of my ability. I understand that no one's perfect. But, I also know I hadn't reached my fullest potential.

* I have a VERY poor work ethic...it's pretty sporadic

I want to be able to live on my own, hold down a job, make close friends, do well in school and just have a more welcoming, friendly vibe to myself. But I'm constantly holding myself back 'cause I hadn't put in the work. I remember all the people during college who went out and not only had an active social life, but also did well in all their classes, volunteered, work a part-time job and managed to look put together throughout the whole process.

But, I also know I hadn't reached my fullest potential. 


*edited for formatting*";36;"I just took another round of thinking about it and came to this word.

Dedication.

Being dedicated means you have made a decision to work towards a goal with a determined pace. You've made a promise to yourself and you're keeping that promise daily or weekly.

Key to this is making a promise you can easily keep. So it has he least possible chance of feeling overwhelming leading to skipping a day which breaks the promise and you loose steam.

My promise for exercise is that I will go to the gym 3 times a week and lift something heavy. All that matters to me is that I keep going to the gym and give my body a reminder that I want it to be strong. Most of the time I do a full strength training program, but some days I'm so lazy I only do one set and that's OK, I kept my promise. It's infinitely better than breaking the habit and losing all my strength as I fall back into the old couch potato routine.";2;0.05555555555555555;[[0.9495267]];[[0.6985748]];0.9929;0.153;0.77;0.076;0.9609;0.204;0.745;0.051;-0.076;0.1441844301970884;0.1272079772079772;0.016976452989111213
[NeedAdvice] How can I teach myself to be disciplined and not overly rely on motivation and emotion?;t3_81udx2;5;"Hi everyone, 

The last post I made, I felt like I hadn't properly explained myself the way I intended to. Not that I said anything particularly offensive; I rambled and hadn't truly gotten my point across. 

So...

2016 hadn't been the best year in my life; though last year was definitely the start of me focusing on myself and what I needed. Now, for 2018, I'd like to put those aspirations into actions. 

I intend to improve my lifestyle by implementing a wide array of habits along the way. 

* **EMOTIONAL/MENTAL** - I would like to be in a place where I have much stronger confidence in myself. To look in the mirror and find beauty, to look deep inside myself and *know* that I am a good person is where I want to be.
*Habits to Implement* - Daily yoga and meditation; preferably early in the morning, where the sun's rising and people are still sleeping. Journaling almost every night before I go to bed would also be a nice habit to implement. 

* **OCCUPATIONAL** - I'm currently job hunting, and since I'm in school full-time, it'd best suit me to look for a part-time position. I'd also like to have a side hustle and save as much as possible.
*Habits to Implement* - I definitely need to build a much stronger work ethic overall, and just always stay productive, generally speaking. 

* **SOCIAL** - I'd like to be more friendly and outgoing, especially towards other people. I've always been pretty shy for the longest time, and feel that at my age, having a solid group of close friends would definitely add to my life.

*edited for formatting*";36;"It's a rough spot to be in.  Consistency builds discipline but consistency requires discipline. 

You gotta make yourself do that thing you don't wanna do.  Schedule and micromanage your day down to the task.

0530 Get out of bed.
0532 Brush Teeth.
0535 Get Dressed for exercise.
0630 Workout
0700 Prepare and eat breakfast.
Etc...

Of course you'd have to tailor it to you.  Print this schedule and put it everywhere you need to.  Set alarms and do the tasks assigned.

"[Need Advice] ""Who am I?""";t3_88o1lo;3;"Hi! I [23F] feel like I'm attempting to obtain very unobtainable things. Let me see if I can put my thoughts into words, because I feel like I can't explain things well.

I compare myself to others. A LOT. And I beat myself up during the comparison, asking myself things like ""Why aren't I like that? Why am I not into that kind of hobby?"" I've gotten so pathetic as to even questioning if I'm ""cool"" or not. I once heard that we are only a collective sum of everyone we've ever met, or encountered, and this fucks with my head so so so so so much, to a point where I'm stricken with such apathy, and sometimes with severe depression to the point that I'm scared for myself.

I don't feel like I have anything in my life that defines me for me. I don't know how to answer ""Who am I?"" I feel like I don't have any titles to apply to myself. I'm a student, I'm a daughter, sure. But those titles don't necessarily bring me the personal joy that I'm seeking. I can't even seem to bring myself to watch a new TV show. Even if I try, I can't focus on it, or I lose interest, or I'll hate myself even more because it feels like I'm forcing myself to try something that will make me more like someone else.

Do you guys know who you are? How did you find yourself? What was the moment that made you self-realize?

Maybe I'm posting in the wrong subreddit, but I'm not exactly sure where else to post this and I've been following this subreddit for a while now. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction if I'm not in the right place?";3;"First of all, I think it's important to stress that you are not at all alone in asking the ""Who am I?"" question. Heck, it might even be the most asked question by humans collectively, ever. So, you might be able to find solace in knowing that there are many others out there who have wondered the very same thing, myself included.

In fact, quite recently I spent many hours thinking about that very question, and I came to some conclusions, which I am going to share with you now. Hopefully some of it helps, and if not, at least I got to practice some writing :)

One of the first things that struck me is that the ""who am I?"" question might not even be the right question to ask. Just think about it this way: ""*who*"" you are changes throughout your life constantly. And if it changes constantly is there really an answer to the question? If there is, it's bounded by the (temporary) present, so it's value is limited.

For example, 10 years ago, you had a completely different body, probably enjoyed different activities than you do now, and probably had some noticeable differences in personality. 20 years from now, you will have a completely different body, probably be doing different things than you are now, and also be a relatively different ""*who*"" than you are now. You won't really be the same, and who you are right now isn't really the same as who you were.

My point is, ""*who*"" you are isn't static. It's a process that changes over time. That's why I think the better question to ask is: ""*how* *am* *I*?"".

By ""how"" I don't mean how you feel or your mood at the present moment, but more your *tendencies*, your *proclivities* - the inertia of all the past moments coming together to form this one.

After all, ""how"" you are determines ""who"" you are. But it's even better than that because ""how"" you are determines ""who"" you are **in** **the** **future**.

So really, the ""how"" comes before the ""who"" and so knowing ""how"" you are as a person is way better than knowing ""who"" you are precisely.

So try looking for how you are. Do you try to make the world a better place with less suffering through your actions? Do you appreciate the little moments in life when they come? Do you take in knowledge and try to learn more about the world so you can eventually change it? There are many more questions like these ones you can ask yourself to figure out ""how"" you are.

You have to realize that answering ""yes"" to any of these questions above is incredibly powerful. It gives you a sense of identity, because it tethers you to something, and it's not something as static as a ""who I am in this present moment"" kind of thing. It's way stronger because it's dynamic and it pushes you forward and shapes your identity to come.

Realizing this for me made me stop trying to make a ""self"" out of everything I did. It allowed me to relax, to understand that I don't have to force an identity out of myself. Instead, *out* *of* *the* *way* *I* *was* *the* *who* *would* *come* *to* *be*.

It seems to me you are forcing yourself to discover an answer to ""Who am I?"" in everything you do. Clearly it's making you feel like you are less than you are and causing you distress.

So, number one, take a deep breath and relax. You don't need to figure everything out right now. Things take time, insights accumulate and you gain wisdom, and that wisdom lets you face the world with your head held high, despite all the shortcomings that life inevitably brings along with it.

Don't compare yourself to others, there's no point doing so. Instead, compare yourself to who you were yesterday and just try to be the tiniest bit better today. That's a good goal, I think.

Ask yourself ""how"" you are. See if you can find meaning and identity in the dynamic being that you are. You are never the same from this moment to the next, don't force yourself to be anything, just let your ""how"" take you there.

Try to be okay with not knowing exactly, to the smallest bit, what kind of person you may be. Let go of ascribing a ""self"" to everything you do. In sounds corny, but in some sense, ""you"" are really only part of the gigantic whole known as the universe. That doesn't mean that you don't matter, of course, it just means that sometimes it's better to let go of thinking about ""yourself"" as some distinct entity, and realizing you are participating in the constantly shifting game of life.

Discovering yourself is therefore not something that happens in a moment. It happens throughout your life, and sometimes it's okay to be unsure, I mean how many of us are actually sure about anything, ever?

Lastly, you matter as person, as flawed as you are (as flawed as we all are). You have much more life in you, and you seem like an inquisitive, bright, and caring individual based on the fact you had the initiative to even ask this question. If you be patient and remain open, I think you will be able to make sense of exactly what's puzzling you currently.

I'm probably the only one around these parts that can see mental breakdowns before they happen.  And that's because I'm of the minority who actually managed to turn mental breakdowns into massive wins.

First... mental breakdowns are very common.  Heck, THE major pathway of meditation involves subjecting our brain to a massive mental breakdown AKA Awakening.  

People just don't want to talk about mental breakdowns, because mental health stigma.  Also, most don't even know they just had a mental breakdown unless it's one of those big explosive types which involves a lot of screaming.

Now, here's the thing.  You've been allowing yourself to stress out so much that your brain and body is overworked.  Too many stress triggers in your brain and you kept on adding more.  Sooner or later, you're gonna feel so tired - that you will like black out - that would be your brain finally triggering a hard reset.

When you come to, you will feel tired BUT not as tired as before and your brain will feel lighter, much lighter.  You will feel way more capable.  Because your brain's just freed up some space.

Now, when this happens - take advantage of it.  USE it properly.  Get as many good habits in and please cut down on the stress.   Don't waste it, because the brain slack from mental breakdowns have time limits.";1;0.33333333333333337;[[0.94933622]];[[0.58845496]];-0.484;0.077;0.838;0.085;0.5459;0.10099999999999999;0.8009999999999999;0.099;-0.010000000000000007;0.0903896103896104;0.033572530864197515;0.05681707952541287

Let's say you want to make a habit of exercising; think about your goals, figure out what time of the day you are most likely to exercise, identify your equipment and the types of exercises you can do, etc.  Write it down, say Mon-Wed-Fri you want to lift weights, write it on a calendar. 

Prepare - This might be the first step or two of your plan.  If you have no exercise equipment, go out and join a gym or clear some space in the basement.  Buy some new workout clothes, download some new music, etc.  

Execute - Once all of the pieces are in place, time to execute.  Stop making excuses for one day and just do it.  Write it down.  Record keeping and being able to visualize my progress are huge motivators for me.  

Maintain - Don't let life's ups and downs derail you.  Stay focused, stay positive.  ";3;1.5;[[0.94228643]];[[0.52893888]];0.3182;0.071;0.929;0.0;0.8859999999999999;0.11599999999999999;0.846;0.038;-0.00700000000000002;0.0;0.1762626262626263;-0.1762626262626263

Let this post be an archive of all the practical methods which everyone has implemented and has helped them. ;2;"3 parts to a habit. 

Cue. 

Routine. 

Reward. 

Find what cues you to start your routine. This can be anything from its 9 am, so cue leaving house for work; to I just ate so cue time to smoke a cigarette.

Once the cue is determined, ask yourself what reward you get from executing the routine. 

Nicotine-cigarette 
Beating traffic-leaving at 9 am

The cue can't be changed. But the routine and reward can. 

Routine change:
Cue nicotine craving, recognize cue, hit vape instead of cigarette, reward nicotine. 

You have to have all three parts. All these together make up the neural pathway for a habit. They get weaker and stronger just like muscles. You have to exercise them with good form to get quality results.

I went to shower and that woke me up. Drank looooads. Then I have been cooking enough for a few days (which reminds me I forgot to take it when leaving for work ugh). I took my time for everything basically for once. And tackled one thing at a time as many of you suggested. I've cooked some healthy balanced food. Then I started the task meant for yesterday. It ended up taking me waaay longer than expected and I suddenly lost the file which made me take a break. Had to because I had dance class anyway. Made me feel waaaay better and happy. I arrived home pretty late and I managed to finish at 1am lol. And I couldn't sleep until 2 because I was overthinking about what to do the next today (so had less than 4 hours of sleep). I made tea this morning so didn't end up buying anything. Had to run to the train though as I was taking too much time. Well I am on my way to work now and took my korean books to study during my break as I have a lot to catch up. I hope today will be good. I have dance class right after work which makes me finish at 10pm. Still need to clean but I think I will fold my laundry as it takes my whole room. Then head straight to bed. I really have to soon get going for real on a project due end of march. Not sure when I can really focus on it. But first have a clean space for a clear mind hopefully.

I don't know how I need help but I really need to get out if this vicious circle. So I would be really grateful to have an insight and advice.


* I've realized I haven't ever ever been eating healthy for the past 3+ months. I have no motivation to cook because there are planning and cleaning to do. I just keep spending on anything I find on my way and back to work. And I just eat whatever I have at home for dinner. Ofc no cooking, sometimes it would just be biscuits.


* I can't live in my environment anymore. I just nap each time I arrive home. I should clean. And I just postpone this for weeks on end. I hate my place. I only have me tiny room to do everything in. No proper view, nice big windows, even a sofa. Just my bed. It's so crammed, I bring my depression back in my room.


* My sleeping schedule is messed up. I realize I waste so much time. Even here. I even don't write and plan my month on my calendar for events to motivate myself. I get 5-6 hours of sleep because I have to wake up way earlier for work nowadays. I always regret getting this little sleep but I hate going to bed at 10-11pm. But then I waste my time watching a movie or scrolling through endless pics.


* Showering and pampering myself is even a drag for me... takes so much time and energy.


* I end up not doing what I need to do AND not keep up my workout routine that made my day. So it depresses me even more. I just hate my place that I am very lazy. Also it is freaking cold outside and windy. Don't want to get out anymore since I already do twice a day and stay in the cold to wait for trains etc.


* The lack of not working out worries me that my efforts and body will get weak. That  I am not making progress anymore which worries me because I have a competition in 5 months and improving is a long term thing.


* I worry about my spending. It's so cold I need a hot drink + my train fees I didn't use to have. I hate having to take my card out at least 5 times a day!


* I have deadlines and I've barely started. I hate having to stop in the middle of what I am doing to get to my scheduled class etc after work. I am just exhausted. And yeah my place is so small I don't have a big working space!


* I have sunday off and another day off during the week. I want to rest and be lazy. And that's what I end up doing but my anxiety gets worse from from not doing anything. I should spend 1 day of the week cleaning and doing laundry and I just hate it. I also have rodents so cleaning their cages is also a drag.


* I barely drink. The two hot tea I buy on my way are the only drink I drink, and maybe one cup od tea at home. I've always barely drink my whole life. 


I sound overall very negative. I may be really depressed but I have no time to go see a doctor. I am lost. :( and hoping this post is the last waste of time and excuse I give myself.
";158;"God, I do not like it when threads started by depressed people don’t get significant attention.  Why?  Because they’ll get even more depressed - that’s why!  If I have to pick the thing I do NOT like the most about the karma-like-vote system - it’s that no-little attention gets interpreted as being left behind / shunned by the herd by the primitive lizard portion of our brains.

OP, do NOT let no-little attention from strangers on the internet get you further down, OK?

Now, I want to help you but... my methods are... prone to increasing depression and anxiety cause too much harsh reality, little on motivational tactics.  (I don’t want to give you existential crises.)

";158;"OP I am in a similar situation to you. Perhaps a little different, but I can give you one solid piece of advice that's helped me:

All those things you listed? Write them down. Whenever you are having a depressive episode, write down the things that make you unhappy. Then put it aside for the moment. 

When your depressive episode tapers off, and you start to feel a little better, and start to feel overwhelmed by everything you put off? Just look at that last, and try to think of a way to fix ONE (1) thing on it. 

An easy one is your living space is messy. The obvious solution to that is clean it up.

Don't worry about what else you ""should do"", or wallow in the fact that you're not going to do it. If this is the routine you have, you already know you're not going to do everything. And it's unfair to yourself to expect it. 

Just pick one small thing you can fix from the list. Do that single thing. Even if it's as simple as just picking up some clothes from the floor and putting them in the dresser, or taking out the trash.

You have taken a step towards fixing that problem. You have already defied yourself and DONE something.

And whenever I feel depressed again, sometimes when that same thing that makes me unhappy comes back (dirty room is my biggest culprit) i can look back and think, ""Hey, I fixed that before. I can do it again"".

";158;"OP, depression is hard. I have a lot of the same issues you posted! Similar to a comment above me I have some tips:

1. If it’s available to you, seek out therapy. Let your doctors know and they can point you in the right direction. Hell, I asked on here and got connected with a GREAT therapist. Find someone who fights for you. 

2. Make a list of all you want to accomplish cleaning wise. If you can do ONE of those things, that’s a great step. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself time to complete these. It’s ok we all end up in ruts sometimes. 

3. If you can move, move! Space is important in being inspired and I too need light and windows, etc to help. 

4. Instead of saying “I don’t have the time” try and say “This isn’t a priority for me”. That quickly helps me get on track with what is ACTUALLY important RIGHT then and makes it to where I can make the right choices for me. 

5. A gratitude journal helps. It may be hard at first but the things start to add up. 

6. Get healthyish frozen meals and meal plan when you can. Don’t make it too difficult for yourself even rice, beans and cheese can be a complete meal. Frozen meals can be good for you if you get the right kinds and are a godsend. 

7. Drink when you’re thirsty. Have one cup of water and slowly sip throughout the day but no worries if you’re not thirsty! Your body is generally really good at letting you know if you’re dehydrated and you get a lot of water from foods too 

I hope these tips help, as they did for me. If not THAT IS OKAY! Every person is different. Acknowledging there is an issue is more than half of the battle. There are people who can help. Good luck.

";158;"OP, I won't pretend I know how to solve depression..but in my experience a single positive habit can snowball into many positive habits.



The best choice for me is exercise. Do it before work if you find it difficult to do it after. Don't worry about doing things perfectly. Just get that one habit.



Once you feel you have that down, it should be easier to eat healthier and sleep better. I would prioritize your physical health, and this will translate into better mental health.";5;0.03164556962025317;[[0.96493024]];[[0.38533614]];-0.9975;0.081;0.764;0.155;0.9781;0.29100000000000004;0.685;0.024;-0.341;-0.022380330397571768;0.2606301106301106;-0.2830104410276824

* I've realized I haven't ever ever been eating healthy for the past 3+ months. I have no motivation to cook because there are planning and cleaning to do. I just keep spending on anything I find on my way and back to work. And I just eat whatever I have at home for dinner. Ofc no cooking, sometimes it would just be biscuits.


* I can't live in my environment anymore. I just nap each time I arrive home. I should clean. And I just postpone this for weeks on end. I hate my place. I only have me tiny room to do everything in. No proper view, nice big windows, even a sofa. Just my bed. It's so crammed, I bring my depression back in my room.


* My sleeping schedule is messed up. I realize I waste so much time. Even here. I even don't write and plan my month on my calendar for events to motivate myself. I get 5-6 hours of sleep because I have to wake up way earlier for work nowadays. I always regret getting this little sleep but I hate going to bed at 10-11pm. But then I waste my time watching a movie or scrolling through endless pics.


* Showering and pampering myself is even a drag for me... takes so much time and energy.


* I end up not doing what I need to do AND not keep up my workout routine that made my day. So it depresses me even more. I just hate my place that I am very lazy. Also it is freaking cold outside and windy. Don't want to get out anymore since I already do twice a day and stay in the cold to wait for trains etc.


* The lack of not working out worries me that my efforts and body will get weak. That  I am not making progress anymore which worries me because I have a competition in 5 months and improving is a long term thing.


* I worry about my spending. It's so cold I need a hot drink + my train fees I didn't use to have. I hate having to take my card out at least 5 times a day!


* I have deadlines and I've barely started. I hate having to stop in the middle of what I am doing to get to my scheduled class etc after work. I am just exhausted. And yeah my place is so small I don't have a big working space!


* I have sunday off and another day off during the week. I want to rest and be lazy. And that's what I end up doing but my anxiety gets worse from from not doing anything. I should spend 1 day of the week cleaning and doing laundry and I just hate it. I also have rodents so cleaning their cages is also a drag.

";158;"Good on you for reaching out for advice! even just outlining them on a page here is a great step forward.

Lately I've struggled to eat enough food too. I found one way to help is to commit to making one big robust Shake per day, then drink half at night and half when you wake up. I'm talking full of everything - make it so thick that the protein powder 
has a tough time mixing fully. I soak various oats/berries/nuts/seeds/spices/salt overnight in a Mason jar and pour it all on top of chopped up spinach or banana (whatever on hand) and throw it into the mixer with loads of other stuff like Hemp Hearts, more frozen things, cocoa powder, you know just fill it with the most delicious things you enjoy and blend that bad-boy up, let it run for a while and get all frothy.

Then I drink half of it and maybe add more water and blend more, leaving a big portion in the fridge. The key for me is to leave a big portion of this Mega-Shake in the fridge for the morning. I usually make the shake in the evening, since it was born out of me saying ""oh shit I really eat something ... I guess"" and then concluding after a few days that this was sometimes my only meal of the day, besides waking up with my few eggs. So now I wake up and have my eggs and a Shake, combined with taking some daily supplements and I feel my nutrition is much improved.

From reading the rest of your post it seems you are unable to benefit from your down-time, where you characterize yourself as wanting to rest and be lazy, and yet when you do that you become exhausted and more anxious, that sounds like cognitive dissonance. And where something bothers you so you try to ignore it, but your coping mechanisms are feeding into your anxiety pattern and aggravating it more - that's a rough one.

It sounds like you know what you want, you have an ambition to improve your lot when you say you want to work out/pamper yourself/feel good, it shows your standards rise above what you find acceptable - which is great! it shows that while you can ""deal with it"" being less than ideal, you can see you want something better than despair and you're on the formative stages of setting things in order. Be where your hands are, try not to distract yourself from your problems - meet them head on, take them in a list. What causes you the most anxiety when you get home? Treat the root of that one, clean up your room so you feel comfortable there in your solace, not trapped by it, get to bed on time for yourself, and for godsake please don't feel guilty for getting a proper good night's sleep, you deserve the best possible relaxation to recharge you for the next day's battle against chaos.";4;0.025316455696202535;[[0.97547694]];[[0.64788188]];-0.9975;0.081;0.764;0.155;0.9959;0.17;0.7609999999999999;0.069;-0.175;-0.022380330397571768;0.1640946502057613;-0.18647498060333306

";158;"I have been where you are and these are a few things I've done in the past/still do: 

First- Therapy. Talk to a professional and they can help with all of this in a constructive way. If you have two days off a week, fitting in an hour long appointment is totally doable. 

For cleaning, I really like the UnFuck Your Habitat site/book/facebook/subreddit. It's really great if you don't know where to start and don't have a lot of motivation due to illness or mental health reasons. There's tons of super quick ""challenges"" that do help when you don't or can't do any type of marathon cleaning. 

For workout- do something like yoga or youtube videos. You can do those at home with minimal set up/tear down. And you can take as many breaks as you want. Yoga is GREAT for strength and it's all body weight. It also helps slow down all these thoughts. 

For food- find any recipes you want to try that are like 5 ingredients or less. Make a SHIT ton out of it if you can. Eat that for the week. Don't think of it as meal-prepping. Meal prepping stresses me out -the idea of being ""on it"", when I'm clearly not ""on-it"" is the worst. Make a warm drink BEFORE you leave for the day to save that money. 

Lastly- for taking care of yourself on a shower/pamper level, write down how you feel when you do those things (relaxed, refreshed, happy) and then how you feel when you DONT do those things (sad, depressed, stressed). Look at that often for encouragement. 

Good luck &lt;3 ";4;0.025316455696202535;[[0.97296822]];[[0.65951846]];-0.9975;0.081;0.764;0.155;0.9883;0.185;0.755;0.059000000000000004;-0.2;-0.022380330397571768;0.0949404761904762;-0.11732080658804794

";158;"Hey you. You sound like me.

One of my biggest problems was getting preoccupied with all the things I had to do. The list was so long that I'd just get overwhelmed and do nothing instead. I'm starting to overcome that by committing to just doing one thing each day. For example, washing my clothes. I do that one day. The next day I take them out of the dryer and fold them. Another day I'll put some things away.

It sounds like you need a routine. Routines are great because you don't think about them. You just automatically do what you've always done. If you've set up healthy routines then you just do healthy stuff on autopilot. So you could practice that. One key is to not change too many things at once (see above). No more than one new element to your routine per week--maybe two. I'd start with showering. Just pick a time to shower, and always shower at the same point in your day. After a while it won't be a struggle anymore.

You sound very busy. I've been there, and it was awful. It's possible you're overcommitted. Are there things in your life you can cut out? What if you moved closer to work, or got a job closer to home? Commuting time really drains your day, although listening to podcasts you really enjoy on the train could turn that into a bit of a relaxing time, maybe.

There's a lot in there I don't think I can help you with. But if you do nothing else, I highly suggest this: make your bed in the morning. It doesn't have to have perfect hospital corners, but at least pull the covers up to the head of the bed and pull the wrinkles out. It takes a few seconds and gives you a suprisingly powerful sense of accomplishment and control over your life.

Good luck!";3;0.0189873417721519;[[0.96729509]];[[0.72721827]];-0.9975;0.081;0.764;0.155;0.9672;0.1;0.8740000000000001;0.027000000000000003;-0.14700000000000002;-0.022380330397571768;0.18005454545454547;-0.2024348758521172

";158;"I have run into the same issue before (i.e. lots of work and then losing control of little things like cleaning, eating right, etc.). 

Get some sleep.  It helps (1) put you into a better mood, (2) more motivated to tackle little things, and (3) overall smarter.  Studies out there show that you actually become dumber with less sleep.

Once you get enough sleep, then start tackling little things day-by-day.  Don't give yourself a hard time.  Over time, you will slowly start to dig yourself out.";3;0.0189873417721519;[[0.95530899]];[[0.55248466]];-0.9975;0.081;0.764;0.155;0.8485;0.16;0.7859999999999999;0.053;-0.18100000000000002;-0.022380330397571768;-0.0027014652014652127;-0.019678865196106555

* I have sunday off and another day off during the week. I want to rest and be lazy. And that's what I end up doing but my anxiety gets worse from from not doing anything. I should spend 1 day of the week cleaning and doing laundry and I just hate it. I also have rodents so cleaning their cages is also a drag.


* I barely drink. The two hot tea I buy on my way are the only drink I drink, and maybe one cup od tea at home. I've always barely drink my whole life. 


I sound overall very negative. I may be really depressed but I have no time to go see a doctor. I am lost. :( and hoping this post is the last waste of time and excuse I give myself.

I went to shower and that woke me up. Drank looooads. Then I have been cooking enough for a few days (which reminds me I forgot to take it when leaving for work ugh). I took my time for everything basically for once. And tackled one thing at a time as many of you suggested. I've cooked some healthy balanced food. Then I started the task meant for yesterday. It ended up taking me waaay longer than expected and I suddenly lost the file which made me take a break. Had to because I had dance class anyway. Made me feel waaaay better and happy. I arrived home pretty late and I managed to finish at 1am lol. And I couldn't sleep until 2 because I was overthinking about what to do the next today (so had less than 4 hours of sleep). I made tea this morning so didn't end up buying anything. Had to run to the train though as I was taking too much time. Well I am on my way to work now and took my korean books to study during my break as I have a lot to catch up. I hope today will be good. I have dance class right after work which makes me finish at 10pm. Still need to clean but I think I will fold my laundry as it takes my whole room. Then head straight to bed. I really have to soon get going for real on a project due end of march. Not sure when I can really focus on it. But first have a clean space for a clear mind hopefully.

* I've realized I haven't ever ever been eating healthy for the past 3+ months. I have no motivation to cook because there are planning and cleaning to do. I just keep spending on anything I find on my way and back to work. And I just eat whatever I have at home for dinner. Ofc no cooking, sometimes it would just be biscuits.


* I can't live in my environment anymore. I just nap each time I arrive home. I should clean. And I just postpone this for weeks on end. I hate my place. I only have me tiny room to do everything in. No proper view, nice big windows, even a sofa. Just my bed. It's so crammed, I bring my depression back in my room.


* My sleeping schedule is messed up. I realize I waste so much time. Even here. I even don't write and plan my month on my calendar for events to motivate myself. I get 5-6 hours of sleep because I have to wake up way earlier for work nowadays. I always regret getting this little sleep but I hate going to bed at 10-11pm. But then I waste my time watching a movie or scrolling through endless pics.


* Showering and pampering myself is even a drag for me... takes so much time and energy.


* I end up not doing what I need to do AND not keep up my workout routine that made my day. So it depresses me even more. I just hate my place that I am very lazy. Also it is freaking cold outside and windy. Don't want to get out anymore since I already do twice a day and stay in the cold to wait for trains etc.


* The lack of not working out worries me that my efforts and body will get weak. That  I am not making progress anymore which worries me because I have a competition in 5 months and improving is a long term thing.

";158;"Have you looked into ADHD before?  Because a lot if what you're talking about sounds a lot like ADHD-PI.  I myself was diagnosed at age 32, and before then I may have made posts similar to yours.

I'm not a psychiatrist, and a psychiatrist is specifically the type of specialist who you would want to make a diagnosis for this sort of thing. There are quick self assessments you can google however, and in under 5 minutes you would have a stronger indicator as to whether my theory might have some credence.  I recommend you take one and see.

Also, note that /r/adhd is an amazing community with great resources in the side bar for people who may have it.

";158;"Being lost is okay for a while. So you don't work out. That's fine. You barely drink. That's okay too. It won't kill ya'. Don't want to take a shower? That's fine. You're stinky, but, again, it's not going to kill anyone. You're not cleaning and doing laundry and you want to spend the day in bed? There are worse things that can happen to you. None of these things are awful. 

The point is that it's okay to be this way for a while, be it a day, a week, or even a couple of months. It's important not to beat yourself up about it. Just be an observer. We're not machines and sometimes we need to get off the road and rest.

Like someone else mentioned here, I've always found that writing my thoughts in a journal is a really good first step to changing yourself and your environment. It might takes weeks to see a change, but examining your feelings about things and yourself is the first step toward changing both. You KNOW your place sucks, but if you were to move, where would you move to? Talk about that in your journal. What are the kinds of things do you want in your next place? Write it in your journal. Talking to yourself as someone who is looking out for you works wonders. Just keep asking yourself why you're doing the things you're doing without judging. In some cases, there's no reason to change things until you're ready to. This all may be a way you're preparing for your next big step, whatever that is. And a journal is a good way to get your negative thoughts out of your brain for a while as you search for positive ones to replace them. Even if your first journal entry is about how stupid writing in a journal is, that's still a first step.

I wish you the best of luck! 

EDIT: I left something dangling.

";158;"As someone else pointed out regarding cleaning, the Unfuck your Habitat subreddit and website provide very helpful tips for people who don't have time to clean. 
Basically, give yourself as little time as you are comfortable with just so you can get started, even 5 min of cleaning is better than no cleaning at all. 
Telling yourself that you can clean or work out for just 5 min makes the task a lot less daunting to start, and if you end up doing more, great! 

I'm also in a similar situation where I live in a tiny one room apartment, I find that surrounding myself with things I like helps a bit,  whether they're posters on the walls or some low maintenance plants here and there, decorating with what you find pleasing and relaxing can help you like your room a bit more.

I took my time for everything basically for once. And tackled one thing at a time as many of you suggested. I've cooked some healthy balanced food. Then I started the task meant for yesterday. It ended up taking me waaay longer than expected and I suddenly lost the file which made me take a break. Had to because I had dance class anyway. Made me feel waaaay better and happy. I arrived home pretty late and I managed to finish at 1am lol. And I couldn't sleep until 2 because I was overthinking about what to do the next today (so had less than 4 hours of sleep). I made tea this morning so didn't end up buying anything. Had to run to the train though as I was taking too much time. Well I am on my way to work now and took my korean books to study during my break as I have a lot to catch up. I hope today will be good. I have dance class right after work which makes me finish at 10pm. Still need to clean but I think I will fold my laundry as it takes my whole room. Then head straight to bed. I really have to soon get going for real on a project due end of march. Not sure when I can really focus on it. But first have a clean space for a clear mind hopefully.

I don't know how I need help but I really need to get out if this vicious circle. So I would be really grateful to have an insight and advice.


* I've realized I haven't ever ever been eating healthy for the past 3+ months. I have no motivation to cook because there are planning and cleaning to do. I just keep spending on anything I find on my way and back to work. And I just eat whatever I have at home for dinner. Ofc no cooking, sometimes it would just be biscuits.


* I can't live in my environment anymore. I just nap each time I arrive home. I should clean. And I just postpone this for weeks on end. I hate my place. I only have me tiny room to do everything in. No proper view, nice big windows, even a sofa. Just my bed. It's so crammed, I bring my depression back in my room.


* My sleeping schedule is messed up. I realize I waste so much time. Even here. I even don't write and plan my month on my calendar for events to motivate myself. I get 5-6 hours of sleep because I have to wake up way earlier for work nowadays. I always regret getting this little sleep but I hate going to bed at 10-11pm. But then I waste my time watching a movie or scrolling through endless pics.


* Showering and pampering myself is even a drag for me... takes so much time and energy.


* I end up not doing what I need to do AND not keep up my workout routine that made my day. So it depresses me even more. I just hate my place that I am very lazy. Also it is freaking cold outside and windy. Don't want to get out anymore since I already do twice a day and stay in the cold to wait for trains etc.


* The lack of not working out worries me that my efforts and body will get weak. That  I am not making progress anymore which worries me because I have a competition in 5 months and improving is a long term thing.


* I worry about my spending. It's so cold I need a hot drink + my train fees I didn't use to have. I hate having to take my card out at least 5 times a day!


* I have deadlines and I've barely started. I hate having to stop in the middle of what I am doing to get to my scheduled class etc after work. I am just exhausted. And yeah my place is so small I don't have a big working space!


* I have sunday off and another day off during the week. I want to rest and be lazy. And that's what I end up doing but my anxiety gets worse from from not doing anything. I should spend 1 day of the week cleaning and doing laundry and I just hate it. I also have rodents so cleaning their cages is also a drag.


* I barely drink. The two hot tea I buy on my way are the only drink I drink, and maybe one cup od tea at home. I've always barely drink my whole life. 


I sound overall very negative. I may be really depressed but I have no time to go see a doctor. I am lost. :( and hoping this post is the last waste of time and excuse I give myself.

I completely understand the feeling of knowing that if I just do this routine I'll improve. I've managed to break through that barrier in the past year after graduating college &amp; created multiple routines that I do daily now. 

Because you have so much that's going on, I recommend only trying to Add 1 Routine at a time. I would go as far as to say one action within the routine. This will help you build up your willpower which is most definitely being drained from all the things you are doing. I managed to build my Morning, Noon, &amp; Night routine in this way &amp; now they're just habits.

I don't know the situation fully, but I also understand that ""Desire to act diminishing"" feeling as well. This one is a much tougher problem, but I would argue it is the root of your problem. You need the initial desire to get you to do it enough until it becomes a habit. I don't want to assume anything, but from my experience back then, I had a tendency to focus on just my desire to reach the goal and not Why I was doing it in the first place. Now I have a clear idea of why I want the goal and I feel that it's a very strong Why.

Are you living near family?  For why I'm asking - see:
https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/82jfvn/needadvice_lacking_the_energy_to_complete_school/dvaqubt/

Nutshell - right now, I think that the biggest barrier to getting disciplined is because stress (in the form of so much shit to do) is a humongous brain eater.  Very hard to pick up good habits if we don't even have the brain slack for it.

Now, most of the top 12 good habits have brain emptying feature built on.  Meditation and Minimalism, for example.  BUT, to really get stress off our backs and really free up brain space - we gotta party up (and I don't just mean marriage and kids).

Invest in location-based relationships.  Prioritize by who you spend the most time with.  It doesn't have to be just about ""fun"" social life.  I would actually rank work relationships and neighbor relationships higher than dating, unless it's serious with a chance to get upgraded to marriage.

Having friends at work who can can watch your back at work.  And having good neighbors who can watch your home for you.  Both are big assets.  They are allies.";2;0.5;[[0.97373415]];[[0.65205849]];0.8493;0.121;0.823;0.055999999999999994;0.9436;0.12300000000000001;0.81;0.067;0.009000000000000008;0.03630952380952381;0.14442640692640688;-0.10811688311688306

I have major depression and anxiety and I take medication for it. Today I had an interview scheduled doing just a low wage fast food job which could help me move toward financial stability, and I was anxious about it for two hours before I was supposed to go and I just stayed home instead. I feel kind of bad about it, but then I guess I just forgot about it and now it's in the past.

I now have the opportunity for two more interviews at two different places, I just need to call them back and set them up. Does anyone have any advice on helping me convince myself to go to the interviews? I tried telling myself I need money to help in the long run and I need to get out of the house, but that didn't really change what I did obviously. I know they're not ideal jobs for me as I want to be a programmer but I'm not at that point where I could get a dev job just yet. I held a low wage job for a few years and even became manager at that restaurant when I wasn't taking medication so I know I can buck up and do it, I just didn't today and I'm not sure why.

My opinion is that if you do not do for runs, eat healthily or meditate then you are not truely trying to get rid of depression and anxiety. For me running and meditation were absolutely key. Run 3-4 times a week. Meditate everyday. It doesn't have to be all in one go, it can be 5 minutes at a time.

I've found before interviews that meditation gets rid of the nerves. Just focus on the breath and then when you notice yourself thinking about something else just drag your attention back to your breath. This not only distracts you from the interview but it allows you to get better at identifying thoughts. This can then help you identify thoughts that make you anxious and depressed and help you shrug them off.

I'm going to take a guess that while you may get some work done, you spend a lot of the time at home, on the internet, you watch porn and you don't really socialise with many people and if you do they're not strangers. I suggest you check out r/nosurf and r/pornfree to help regenerate your dopamine receptors. Desensitised dopamine receptors means that you won't be as motivated.

I believe the lack of socialising especially with strangers is a big reason why you're anxious for the interview as it was with me.

With the worrying thoughts and then the stress, it completely undermines the functionality of the medication, because I can't do anything productive when I'm that anxious.

L-theanine, a supplement that is extracted from certain leaves made to make tea, lowers blood pressure, heart rate, and general anxiety. I just bought some today and it works immediately. I took 200mg and had a cup of green tea for caffeine (about 50mg of caffeine) and that worked well. It makes you tired I think if you don't take it with caffeine. So it helps with sleep too.

Also exercise is always helpful. Exercise is probably the best supplement.

[NeedAdvice] I have a bad habit of job-hopping. I want to learn to be more responsible and independent.;t3_88r95u;9;"25/F, graduated from college in 2015. Since then I've been job hopping, haven't stayed anywhere for longer than six or seven months. To be fair, part of the reason why is because I have been doing mostly organic farm work, which is seasonal, and after the season is up I have to find a winter job, then the next season comes around and something causes me to need to find a new farm job (they can't pay me, or last year when I started graduate school in September). This past year, though, it was pretty much my fault. I quit my farm job mid-season, after just 3 months, because I had a rather emotionally and verbally abusive, micromanaging boss who made me miserable. 


Anyway, I don't mean to entirely blame external factors, I know that some of this is also a ""me"" problem. I think one reason is that in college I worked my ass off to prepare myself for an academic job and graduate school, got lots of research experience, etc. When I graduated from college, I was farming in hopes of getting practical experience to compliment the research experience I had (I study sociopolitical sustainable agriculture, broadly speaking). I then met a farmer dude at the farmers' market and fell in love with him to the point where, over the course of the 2 years we dated, I gave up all my academic dreams (and dropped out of grad school) to pursue farming to make my farmer boyfriend happy. He never got a college degree and resented my love for academia after awhile, and discouraged me from pursuing it further. I think I quit my last farm job, in part, because I had invested my entire life and identity into this boyfriend, and I wasn't happy. I remember spending full days weeding and dreaming of getting my PhD, doing my own research, teaching college students, and other goals I've had for my life. When I quit that job and decided to pursue academia again, the boyfriend started to resent my irresponsible choice, me as a person, and the relationship. He stopped putting effort in, stopped being nice, argued with me when I brought up commitment, pretty much stopped being a loving boyfriend as soon as I made that choice to quit my farm job and try to dust off and go for my real dreams and ambitions.


Now, I've broken up with the dude, am living in my father's basement, and got myself a research assistantship at a prestigious university near me. It's starting in two weeks and I'm kinda nervous I'm gonna fuck it up. I REALLY don't want to fuck this up and quit like the last job. I think a great incentive for me is that this assistantship will actually, tangibly move me closer to my academic dreams, unlike farming. I want to commit to this. I feel like a loser, being 25 and still living with dad, in nearly the exact same place professionally as I was when I graduated college 3 years ago. It's time for a change.


TL;DR Any advice for holding down a job, being more responsible, and becoming independent?";96;"I think you're framing this all negatively. From my perspective you have this amazing life! Thoughts:

The boyfriend thing sucks because it distracted you from goals and clearly wasn't a great fit. I've been there. But you need to use it as a learning opportunity for the next relationship in terms of the kind of person you choose and how to set boundaries for the relationship and yourself. It's helped you grow and that can't be a bad thing.

It's amazing you got that interesting job! Good for you! You're not going to screw it up especially if you stay focused on your goals in your career.

Also all you experience on the farms sounds amazing. Sounds like it was complementary to your education and it is also so good for people and the earth. You should be proud of yourself! And yeah with seasonal work you do end up hopping around alot.

As for living with your dad - no big deal. You have a roof over your head and this won't be a forever thing. 

Honestly I'm in my mid thirties and I've achieved a lot less than you. You have sooooooo many more years to fail, learn, succeed etc. You are not defined by your past mistakes. You got this.

Edited to add advice : set small achievable SMART goals to help you feel more successful as time goes on.

TL;DR Any advice for holding down a job, being more responsible, and becoming independent?";96;"It doesn’t sound like you have a job hopping problem. You have done seasonal  work and quit a bad job. 

Fulfillment in work is learning to enjoy the struggle. Success is not guaranteed, but the struggle is. If you can find that thing in life, where when you go through the struggle of getting better at that thing, and that very struggle brings you more energy than it takes away, that’s game over. You have won at life.

It sounds like you have your area of interest. If so then the usual tactics can help you manage the non-fun parts of it. Things like setting boundaries, having consistent daily routines, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, doing some kind of meditation/reflection regularly, setting goals, keeping a list of the most important things you need to do to move you toward your goals and updating that list daily, and so forth.

TL;DR Any advice for holding down a job, being more responsible, and becoming independent?";96;"So your academic field is farming-related, plant-related or maybe biology-related?  

For a decade, higher education has been reminding me too much of gambling, but if it’s about growing plants - Go For It!

Though maybe I’m wrong.  Would help a lot to know specifically what sort of research you’re doing.

Considering how labor-intensive farming can be, I think your problem is more of “easily get swept up by romantic notions” rather than discipline.  After all, you did graduate and did farm work for a couple of years.

I’m assuming you ain’t scared of handling insects, right?  Cause you did weeding.  You got your hands dirty, for love.  Yeah, in retrospect... it sounds stupid but undisciplined?  Nah, because farm work is not easy.

Be more patient with yourself.  You’re young.  You got swept up by romance but you also got grit enough to tackle farming.

Remember that progress isn't linear, and you can never truly go backwards because you are always learning something that will benefit you if you choose to see it that way.

I am also 25 and living with my parents. I had a mental breakdown last year and needed to move back home to focus on my mental and emotional health. It was a very good descision on my part and has led to immense growth. In that period of time, I begun dating two people who ended up being a ""distraction"" from where I wanted to go and broke up with them after 6 months. I was only making $1000 a month and I was partying a lot and not working as much. Since breaking up with them, I made half of what I made all last year in one month, I have quit drinking and partying completely. I don't see my time spent with them as a waste of time at all, I only reaffirmed my goals and desires to myself and the time spent with them has made me realize my true priorities. I am stil living with my family, but I have also in the past 2 months paid off half of my debt, begun saving and investing, and have begun to repair my credit. So while I could say, ""oh my god I'm 25 and living with my mom I suck"" I choose rather to see this as a transition period in which I am able to be extremely productive and able to focus on health and healing, working and making myself and my happiness a priority. 

In short: you're doing fine!

I then met a farmer dude at the farmers' market and fell in love with him to the point where, over the course of the 2 years we dated, I gave up all my academic dreams (and dropped out of grad school) to pursue farming to make my farmer boyfriend happy. He never got a college degree and resented my love for academia after awhile, and discouraged me from pursuing it further. I think I quit my last farm job, in part, because I had invested my entire life and identity into this boyfriend, and I wasn't happy. I remember spending full days weeding and dreaming of getting my PhD, doing my own research, teaching college students, and other goals I've had for my life. When I quit that job and decided to pursue academia again, the boyfriend started to resent my irresponsible choice, me as a person, and the relationship. He stopped putting effort in, stopped being nice, argued with me when I brought up commitment, pretty much stopped being a loving boyfriend as soon as I made that choice to quit my farm job and try to dust off and go for my real dreams and ambitions.


Now, I've broken up with the dude, am living in my father's basement, and got myself a research assistantship at a prestigious university near me. It's starting in two weeks and I'm kinda nervous I'm gonna fuck it up. I REALLY don't want to fuck this up and quit like the last job. I think a great incentive for me is that this assistantship will actually, tangibly move me closer to my academic dreams, unlike farming. I want to commit to this. I feel like a loser, being 25 and still living with dad, in nearly the exact same place professionally as I was when I graduated college 3 years ago. It's time for a change.


TL;DR Any advice for holding down a job, being more responsible, and becoming independent?";96;"We all get off track sometimes. It happens to all of us, especially at 24-26. It’s a HUGE period of emotional growth. 

If I were you, I’d focus on letting go of what you feel you’re to blame for in the past. The truth is, feeling that blame isn’t serving you anymore. The farming is gone, the unsupportive boyf is gone, and you’re back on the track that you’ve always wanted to be on.

It’s not easy to stay committed to something when you have no passion or drive for that thing.

You weren’t passionate about farming...you were following someone else’s passion. Now that you’re outta there, it’s time to let it go. 

I don’t know you but based on your post, if you step into this research thing with the passion you have for academia, *you will do fantastic*.

Shit is going well for you, whether you feel it or not right now.

[NeedAdvice] I have a bad habit of job-hopping. I want to learn to be more responsible and independent.;t3_88r95u;9;"25/F, graduated from college in 2015. Since then I've been job hopping, haven't stayed anywhere for longer than six or seven months. To be fair, part of the reason why is because I have been doing mostly organic farm work, which is seasonal, and after the season is up I have to find a winter job, then the next season comes around and something causes me to need to find a new farm job (they can't pay me, or last year when I started graduate school in September). This past year, though, it was pretty much my fault. I quit my farm job mid-season, after just 3 months, because I had a rather emotionally and verbally abusive, micromanaging boss who made me miserable.

[NeedAdvice] Been slacking in university and I want to change.;t3_82zq8v;2;"I've been slacking a lot in university for the past year. Mostly because of other extenuating circumstances outside of school and also because I convinced myself all I needed was to graduate and then get a job.

I saw a career counsellor yesterday and she drew up a map of the different paths I could take if I wanted to become a psychologist or something to do with mental health. I've finally found a passion in psychology so my dream or how I see myself in a career is mentoring students or becoming a psychotherapist. Something like that. I had an idea I would probably need a masters degree in clinical or counselling psychology. To my surprise, she said a PhD is required to be able to diagnose anyone and become an actual psychologist.

Now being the anxious and avoidant person I am, I neglected seeing a career counsellor for the longest time because I was afraid of what they would say about the possibilities of my future. Anything to do with my future gives me high anxiety and stress that negatively affects my health.

I feel like a complete idiot now because I was going through this past year just trying to pass my courses. Haven't handed in any major assignments. I believe I have a phobia of written/typed assignments like research papers, etc. I can study and do tests very easily but assignments feel like I'm approaching my death. I've struggled trying to overcome this phobia and I've seen many health and education professionals to try and work through this but there has been no improvement still. I honestly feel like I'm an ungrateful student because so many people out there dream of getting this education and then here is me who hasn't put in much effort and tries to avoid school like as if it's a plague.

I'm posting here because I want to change all this. I know doing a 180 at this point is next to impossible but I understand how small changes can lead to big changes. I know I have it in me to get high grades and I can be really determined in things that I am passionate about. I just want to get out of this phase and stop lingering on what's wrong with me and making excuses for why things can't get done. I want to stop fearing university and start to enjoy it.

Now that I know I need a high GPA and I need to do a lot of extra-curricular activities and get a job, I am feeling extremely determined right now to start somewhere. I need to get over this idea in my head of staying in my comfort zone and avoiding everything that's good for me out there. So how do I start? How do I start making these life changes? How do I move forward from this?

TL;DR: I've slacked in university the whole year and now I'm ready to change and get back out there. I want to stop fearing school and start doing something with my life instead of sitting at home all day in bed. Please give me some tips or motivation for how to get started and how to keep moving forward. Give me that pep talk or lecture I should have gotten long ago so I wouldn't be slacking in school. If you also have tips on how to get over essay phobia, please let me know. Any feedback and advice is appreciated!";3;"Let me share with you, a personal story of mine. When I was just graduating high school, senior year actually, I was called into my counselors office. I walked in, and she had me sit down in a chair facing towards her. She pulled up my high school transcript, and told me my grades and GPA. Nothing outstanding, but I hadn't failed anything, and I had some possibilities for college. She wrote down a few names of schools I could apply for and potentially get accepted into, and I was on my way. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I had never thought about college up until that meeting with her that day. Yes, I knew college was something important, and that my parents really wanted me to go, but I never personally put any thought into what I wanted to do in college. I never thought of where I wanted to be in life or what I wanted for myself other than the bland idea of success. That said, when I got to applying for schools, I pulled up the first school's website. An HBCU about 2 hours from my house. I submitted my application, which came with an essay section, and I stopped. I had 8 other schools I could have potentially applied to, but I didn't apply because I wasn't interested enough or knowledgeable enough about what I was doing. 

&amp;nbsp;

I got accepted. My parents were happy. My family was happy. I was just proud of my essay, as I immediately assumed that it was the sole reason I got accepted. You see, I've always been pretty good at writing, and I'm pretty expressive when I want to be, so writing that essay was probably the most interesting part of that college application, so it was the only thing I put much thought and care into. Anyway! I got accepted, and thanks to my parents sacrifice in the military, I was going to school with a GI Bill under me. **Free education, free books, free dorm, no debt**. I literally had nothing to worry about. I had four years of school paid for, all I had to do was pass my classes and receive my degree. My degree. What the hell did I want to get a degree in though? Again, I never put much thought into college, so I never thought too deeply over what I'd study if I got accepted. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's when Computer Science was introduced to me by family members. The pay was pretty good, there were lots of jobs looking for Comp Scientists, and the biggest reason that I received from my family, and the reason I decided to study it was because, ""You're always on your computer anyway. Why not make some money with it?"". And so it was decided, I'd go into college and choose a Computer Science degree. My freshman year, I had introductory classes, an English course and some other filler course. I finished the year with a 3.9 or something, ended up on the Dean's List. I felt great and my parents were overjoyed. Their son was succeeding! I enjoyed a busy summer working at a daycare center, and a fun center.

&amp;nbsp;

The next year is when everything started changing. I got a taste of my first few classes in Computer Science. Math was never my strongest subject, and I grew up in high school hating the course because it seemed that no matter how hard I studied (which admittedly wasn't very much to begin with) I could never understand the subject matter. I didn't do nearly as well with my grades my first Sophomore year, and actually failed my math class. This was my first realization that Computer Science may not be for me. But as I explained my grades and performance to my parents and family, they tried to pick me back up and tell me to try harder, get a tutor and get more focused. Next semester came, and I did even worse than before, barely passing the math course, but failing the next computer course. 

&amp;nbsp;

Junior year came around, and I had failed both my calculus course and my necessary Computer Science course. I was stuck. I didn't know what to do, and I was miserable with my classes and the route I was on for Computer Science. I mentioned these difficulties to my parents and the rest of my family, and they told me how IT could be a better route. Not as much math involved, and I could still make some good money. I went with their recommendation and tried switching my major to IT. More of the same, I was still struggling in school, not taking my studies seriously, and failing math. It was around this time that I started doing some serious soul searching and self reflection. The remaining of the semester, I basically clocked out of school and decided to focus on myself and figure out what **I** wanted for myself, and not what my family thought I should do for myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's when I came to the realization that I want to do something involving social work or psychology. During the time I took to find myself, I started looking into psychology, the mind and the power of self belief, motivation, discipline, etc. I loved every moment of it and started trying to incorporate all that I was learning into my personal life. As Junior year ended, I brought my personal findings to my parents and waited for their response. **They were not happy**. 3 years of a GI Bill that I had wasted, and now I came to them saying I wanted to do a complete 180 in direction my would be Senior year, my graduating year! They denied my request. If I wanted to study psychology or sociology, I'd be on my own, no financial help, and they would not use the remaining GI Bill to help me. I got scared. I had never been on my own financially before, and hearing this put the fear of God in me. We discussed what could be done with family and counselors at the university, and MIS came up. It's still related to technology, and thought I'd probably still need an additional year and a half of classes, I could come out with a degree. Once again, I did what they told me. 

&amp;nbsp;

However, 3 months in, and following the gradual progress I made in finding my passion, my self confidence and love for understanding the mind, I knew I would not be happy continuing on this path. Not only on the route of MIS, IT or Computer Science, but following what everyone else told me to do. All my life, I'd always been guided into what I should do for myself and been told what was best for me. My parents were always there to get me out of trouble or find solutions for myself, but because of this extensive care, I'd never been able to fail and learn things on my own. And the path of choosing to pursue Psychology after I had thrown 3 years of Technology schooling away was ridiculous to them, understandably. But now, I believed in myself, and though I knew the route I was choosing would be hard and difficult, I was determined to see my self goals met. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I dropped out of university, and stopped pursuing Technology. I couldn't switch my major over to Psychology at school because my GPA had dropped so low, and I wasn't able to take filler classes anymore to raise my GPA because I had taken them all to retake courses I had failed. I had literally blown a free degree. And yet, these last couple months have been some of the most exciting times of my life. I'm having to work for myself and make my own money to pay for rent on an apartment I had gotten at the beginning of Senior year, when the GI Bill money was still coming in. I still have to eat, and I still have to put gas and maintenance in my car. This shit is tough. But, I'm pushing through and making my own decisions. I'm making a plan on how I'm going to go back to school and study Psychology, either working full time, or going into the Military and get my own GI Bill. That aside, I'm making life changes that I didn't have the drive to make before hand because everything was handed to me. 

&amp;nbsp;

My parents are scared. My family is concerned, and I'm more excited about life than I've ever been before. I'm throwing myself into the jaws of life and I'm determined to get to where I see myself, and I won't allow anyone or anything to tear down this newfound confidence. I've failed a few times, I've hurt for money and been scared on whether I'd be able to pay rent or have gas and hope I don't get hit by a car since I don't have health insurance. And yet I'm still excited, and I still work towards working on all these issues while still seeing my path through. I don't have a clear path towards my future, but I know where I want to be, and I'm going to get there, regardless of my circumstances. Nothing can stop me.   

&amp;nbsp;

Now, why did I share this story with you? How does it relate to your current situation? You asked the question in your post: 

&gt; How do I get started? How do I start making these life changes? How do I move forward from this?

The answer to these questions is simply, get started. You need to take action towards your goals. If I may say, I think what you're looking for in your question, is a solution that helps you avoid making those scary decisions you've more than likely already come up with in your head. Those scary decisions that you're hesitant to make, **those** are the actions you need to take in order to get started. If you feel you need to start small before tackling the bigger objectives, in a way to ease your way into those decisions, so be it, but understand you won't start making noticeable change until you finally start taking action towards those fearful actions. That's how you get started.

I strongly believe that an healthy look towards ""mistakes"" is one where I see them as the encounter between a personal struggle of mine and an environment that provided ways to procrastinate instead of ways to overcome this struggle.

[NeedAdvice] How do you find fulfilment in life?;t3_7vu1lj;15;"I have been told by my friends and family I have a great life. I work as an engineer and get to have amazing time off. This past year every 3 months I’ve taken a month off to travel. I feel blessed to travel a lot and to see beautiful scenery and learn new cultures. I found happiness and excitement in this. It made me focus on ploughing through my work where I do horrible hours as I work night shifts. 



However, recently I have lost that spark and joy within myself. I don’t feel any excitement even though I am going away for a month again to travel. I feel aimless and directionless in my life. I don’t feel valued at work and unfulfilled as the only progress is increasing pay check. I don’t feel I am expanding my knowledge and doing work which is meaningless. There is no satisfaction I get from doing my work nor any purpose. My day to day life is depressing, all I do is go to work, eat and sleep. There is no excitement or anyone in the city I live in to meet anyone. Life is dull and has no colour nor vibrancy. My friend used to live with me but he has moved away and I feel alone.



I used to be happy when I exercised and felt accomplished when I learnt new portfolios to manage. I met a woman who I thought was great but it escalated quickly. She suffered from depression and I got out of it because I couldn’t handle it. Now she blames me and says I am weak. I felt I caused it and tried to apologise but all she did was hurt me by saying my life is pathetic. I feel like it because I don’t have anything I can find of value. All my friends are settling down and getting mortgages as well as progressing in their own field. While I am stuck in a job which has no progress to improve. No promotions to focus on. I feel I have achieved nothing and feel empty in my life. I don’t have anything I set myself when I was young and life is not progressing in the way I envisioned. 


I broke down crying whilst playing the piano by myself in my lonely house and hit rock bottom. No one was around and I feel sorry for myself. I have my brother and my family for support but I still feel inside me deep dissatisfaction and sadness. I don’t know who I am anymore and what I should do with my life. I suppose this is my way of expressing what I am thinking but I can’t go on like this. I feel someone has taken control and made me feel sad all the time. I feel great sadness everyday and my heart is heavy. I don’t know if any of this resonates but if you do maybe you could help me. I’m tired and just want to get better back when I felt happiness.

Start there. Start exercising again.

&gt; I have been told by my friends and family I have a great life.

Lol. Who cares what people think about your life. The only thing that really matters is what you think about your life. 

After all, you're the one who has to live with the misery of it all.

Everything loses its novelty eventually - even travel. A lot of the time I find most people who love travelling a lot just do it to escape from their life situation.

They're trying to find something external that will help them deal with all the struggles and frustrations they feel internally but that's where the issue lies.. Internally.

No matter where you go, you are always going to bring this baggage with you and suffer unless you face it head on and fix the issue.

Otherwise it's like putting a small bandaid over a deep wound that is bleeding out. Eventually the wound gets worse and worse that these bandaids (aka travels) don't work anymore.

When you do something that is purposeful and meaningful to you, peace, contentment and happiness *tend* to ensue. When you do sometihng meaningless or you find has no intrinsic value that's when you start to suffer.

A lot of people starting out want money, money, money, then they realize when they get it - if they ever do, that money is not the solution to their problems. That's when people really get fucked up.

Their whole life they have been led to believe that having ""enough"" or more money would make them happy. Then they get there and they think ""Holy shit? This is it, this is all I've been working for?""

And generally one of two things happens... Either they:

1. Get depressed
2. Figure out a better way to live life

This is the crossroad you now face in life and it is ultimately up to you which path you choose to go down. 

Your day to day life *is* depressing but guess what? You are choosing to do what you do each day. You don't *have* to go to work, but you choose to. (I'm not saying you should quit, but it is an option).

Outside of work there is still a lot of hours in the day, perhaps stop squandering it and put it towards something more productive or that you find interesting or valuable.

&gt; All my friends are settling down and getting mortgages as well as progressing in their own field.

Good for them, it doesn't really fucking matter though. They might just be as unhappy as you, or perhaps they might be even happier. The key here is to not look outside at others, for what they are doing or what they think.

It's to look internally and figure out what you want to do and what will make you happy or more at peace.

Stop being a little hamster in the rat race of society that has to constantly live up to certain expectations. 

&gt; I still feel inside me deep dissatisfaction and sadness. I don’t know who I am anymore and what I should do with my life. I suppose this is my way of expressing what I am thinking but I can’t go on like this. I feel someone has taken control and made me feel sad all the time.

Exactly. You are living a life you think you should be living based off what other people deem to be success or what you were conditioned to believe means ""success"" or ""happiness"" as you were growing up, hence why your current life doesn't match up to what you envisioned.

Your challenge now, if you wish to take it up, is to actually do a lot of inner work to figure out who you are, not what your parents, firends, or society conditioned you into being and believing who you are.

I'll end this with a quote from someone much wiser than myself:

";43;"I found 'progress' makes us feel happy and alive. This is why you see many people in their 20's quickly jump from college, to working, to getting engaged, married, buying a house, and having a kid all within ~5 years. Each event is a new 'high' and shows progress with society's standard. The sad this is, once the high wears off, you're left with bills, debt, and maybe a career that could have grown more. Things you missed out on like traveling and knowing yourself. This is why people become depressed in their 30's and 40's after realizing ""Wow, this is all there is now"".

That's just the typically 'life narrative' example, but you can see the same dynamics in anything. Take a look at how you feel in your job. You feel depressed, no promotions in sight, nothing to work towards. This makes you feel unhappy and unstimulated. To fix this, you either need to find how to make progress in this job or leave. In many cases, leaving for new opportunities is the best choice.

The same goes for your traveling. I bet the excitement you go from your first few trips was huge. As you did more though, you needed to probably travel to farther, more exotic places. I didn't go on vacations when I was younger or in college. After college, I started going on 2-3 hour roadtrips on the weekends. In my mind, I felt like I was some grand explorer and I got so much excitement out of it. After a while however, this was the new normal and was fun, but not as gratifying. The first time I drove 6 hours to the beach and finally experienced that, I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. Now, it would be fun, but not the same excitement. Next step was going on my first airplane. Now I'm planning to either going to Europe or Japan. To you, with more travel experience, maybe Europe isn't as stimulating because you've been to other places.

I hope the above proves my point, but seeing progress and doing new things is what makes us happy. It's pushing those boundaries and comfort zones. Currently you're in the ho-hum of work every day in a job you don't see progress in. Step 1 is changing that.

Side note: DO NOT fall into the trap of thinking you need to get married, start a family, or buy a house to feel fulfilled. That can come with time if that's on your list. You need to feel fulfilled and achieve other things before this. It's a quick high and will temporarily fix your feelings, but in 5-10 years, you'll wake up unfulfilled again crying over the piano, but this time you won't be able to explore and experiment. You'll be stuck.";3;0.06976744186046512;[[0.9841564]];[[0.66148441]];0.6154;0.168;0.6729999999999999;0.159;0.9937;0.158;0.768;0.075;-0.07400000000000001;0.06669256669256668;0.21128342245989312;-0.14459085576732644

";43;I would say it’s important to always expose yourself to new things. Life is just order and chaos, anytime you try something new say like you did with piano, you put yourself in an area of chaos. You likely were bad at first and it might have felt crappy, but as you progress you feel good. Having a normal life that repeats day in, day out is complete order, which for some is fine, but for others like you it isn’t. You seek chaos to be humbled and grow from it, this is likely why you started traveling. Though now you know how to travel well, so it isn’t chaos anymore, not much anyways. I’d recommend you find something new to work towards that interests you, even if it’s hard in the beginning once you begin to understand it (that transition from chaos to order) you’ll get that feeling of excitement that there are so many things in life to explore. Everything you can explore in life (such as hobbies) provides a new angle in the vision of life. The more things you explore the more expansive your vision of life will be, and you’ll see there is an infinite amount of beautiful and interesting things life holds.

Get professional help. For now try to do the following things people always say you should do:

* eat healthy (prepare it yourself preferably)
* exercise
* do things that should/used to make you happy
* do social things
* keep a diary to set and evaluate goals
* meditate

It's good exercise, you get to learn a new skill/self-defense, it's a lot of fun, and you get to be around other people.  You can try it for a month to see if you like it.  If you do - great, if you don't - now you know.  I recommend an mma gym because you will have the option of both boxing and jiu jitsu classes, whereas you can only box at a boxing gym.

You say that you are not goal driven, and rather are motivated more by how much you enjoy something in the moment. In this case I would suggest that you put yourself in situations where you can really feel the improvements that you've made.

[NeedAdvice] I really need help with motivating myself at work to actually do work. My family is depending on me!;t3_7xm0ey;4;"Hi everyone.  I actually up until today did not know about this sub, and I hope I can get some help here.  Basically, I am totally unmotivated to do much of anything at work, and I am what my wife and two children are relying on for an income.  I work in IT at a local health department near where I live as a help desk technician.  I have been here for almost three years, and at first I loved it, being my first official IT job, finally, at 35.  I'm now 37.  Slowly, though, I've became more and more disillusioned with being passed up for promotions and higher positions more than once.  That plus uncertainty with our department as a whole, such as positions not being posted again after being filled, and lots of rumors about us, leave me more than a little nervous about things.  I've also been written up twice within the last year for my performance, even though those who are considered my senior techs can disappear for hours at a time, and do whatever they want basically, and are praised and promoted.

I'm not saying I do nothing at all, because I do take help desk calls and, while I've been through bouts of not doing so, properly document them.  I also do have bouts where I will stay late, one time an hour and a half, in order to finish setting up some computers for delivery, but that's rare.  I just feel more and more like what I do doesn't matter to my manager, and that it won't matter anyway.  While what I posted above may not make it sound so, I've actually been 2nd and 3rd in the last few months in the number of tickets closed based on reports my manager sends, and the 1st person isn't a tech, but she gets to hand out tickets and meddle with a lot of stuff, so she doesn't sound, so technially I've been 1st and 2nd.

However, I never hear the first word of praise or anything from my manager about this, or almost nothing at all, unless he writes me up.  He has a very hands off approach, because he doesn't like conflict.  And that's what leads me to believe, even as he sends out reports like that once a month, it doesn't really matter to him.

I spend a lot of my time browsing Reddit, watching YouTube, or doing anything other than what I'm supposed to be doing.  Being in IT, I basically have unlimited access, well thanks to our main network person, otherwise it's quite restricted.  I know I shouldn't, but it's very easy to do.

I'm sorry for the long post, I just wanted to show you where I am right now.  As I said, I'm the sole worker right now for my family, and the income I'm making, which is almost double of what I've ever made in my life(but still below $35k), is what we're surviving on.  I know an easy answer might be to just quit, but based on the status of my employment, which is not contract, there are lots of protections in place for losing my job, and even with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration(which I finished earning during this job), I don't know if I'd be able to just pick up another job making the same amount easily.  I need some help with ways to motivate myself to get my computers set up and actually close out the tickets I get that sometimes sit my queue over a month before I get around to doing them.  My family and their health, wellness, and safety should be enough, but I guess it isn't.  I really appreciate any thoughts you might have about this.

[NeedAdvice] I really need help with motivating myself at work to actually do work. My family is depending on me!;t3_7xm0ey;4;"Hi everyone.  I actually up until today did not know about this sub, and I hope I can get some help here.  Basically, I am totally unmotivated to do much of anything at work, and I am what my wife and two children are relying on for an income.  I work in IT at a local health department near where I live as a help desk technician.  I have been here for almost three years, and at first I loved it, being my first official IT job, finally, at 35.  I'm now 37.  Slowly, though, I've became more and more disillusioned with being passed up for promotions and higher positions more than once.  That plus uncertainty with our department as a whole, such as positions not being posted again after being filled, and lots of rumors about us, leave me more than a little nervous about things.  I've also been written up twice within the last year for my performance, even though those who are considered my senior techs can disappear for hours at a time, and do whatever they want basically, and are praised and promoted.

I'm not saying I do nothing at all, because I do take help desk calls and, while I've been through bouts of not doing so, properly document them.  I also do have bouts where I will stay late, one time an hour and a half, in order to finish setting up some computers for delivery, but that's rare.

[NeedAdvice] Waking up early while my roommate is still asleep;t3_86esob;9;"Hi everyone. I'm a college student who's hitting a mid-semester low and I need to make some positive changes for my productivity. 

I'm really making an effort to get up early on the days that I don't have a morning class, but having a roommate makes this difficult. My alarm has to be pretty quiet so I don't wake her up, and I'm very prone to hitting snooze in my sleep. I can't turn on music or a light if she's still asleep, either. To make it worse our dorm is oddly shaped and the only two windows are next to her bed--I sleep (and live :( ) in a corner of total darkness. 

Once I feel awake, I have a hard time getting out of bed because I waste time on my phone. If I didn't need it for my alarm I would totally keep it out of arms reach, but with my current situation that's not really an option. 

As an example: last night I went to bed at 11, was woken up by my alarm at 7, snoozed until 8:15/8:30, and didn't actually get up until around 9:30.

";8;"This is a problem that I’ve been struggling with as well, and have only started to get better after graduating college, yet I know there’s hope. 

For mental...

This quote has helped me get up many mornings, especially when I have to get up early. 

“At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?” - Marcus Aurelius 

I don’t necessarily read it every morning, but It always comes to mind because I have my alarm labeled as “wake up to live”.

This works even when I have to wake up at 5:30 on days when I want to get things done before work at 7:00. 

For physical...

The best thing that I have found to stay up is to drink water **immediately** after turning my alarm off. I keep water by my bedside. It wakes you up and reduces your body temperature a bit, which is what is necessary if you are to get out from under the covers.

Which leads me to.. actually throwing the covers off of you as soon as you wake up, and not touching them until you make your bed. This also helps reduce your body temperature.

The last thing I have found that helps is washing my face with cold water (from my college years) and now taking cold showers. Yes, I know I am repetitive with this cooling down thing, but it works amazingly for waking yourself up so that you can get up in the morning.

I know this may be hard for you if you’re in a dorm, as your bathroom may be outside of your living quarters. I struggled with this as well. 

Here’s a set routine you can use for this if you’d like, mix and match / delete as you see fit: 

-	wake up from alarm and throw your covers off
-	turn alarm off and read quote 
-	drink 8 oz of water
-	rinse face ( or if your crazy like me take a cold shower)


Hope this helps!!

[NeedAdvice] What calendar program are you using to keep on top of things?;t3_86uj2t;4;"Google Calendar has basic functionality but the 'overlapping' really gets on my nerves. It's deceiving that I put in an event at 18:00 - 18:15 and another 18:15 - 18:30, and as Google only allows 30 minute blocks, they overlap.

This is really very irritating. So much so that I've been on the search for a better Calendar app.

The lack of ability to ""Copy paste"" events is also very annoying. You've got to manually go into the event and press ""Copy"" - Why?

It's so unnecessarily tedious.

I've looked at Outlook, which does seem to solve these problems nicely, but then I want to view my calendar on my phone.

This isn't anything new, either. Having 15 minute intervals goes back to 2009 for fuck sake..

So, now that I've let some frustration off about Google's lack of caring about their interfaces, can anyone recommend a calendar app that syncs with Android and has a GUI that isn't deceiving?

[NeedAdvice] What calendar program are you using to keep on top of things?;t3_86uj2t;4;"Google Calendar has basic functionality but the 'overlapping' really gets on my nerves.

[NeedAdvice]I need help. I‘m just lurking on subs similar to this one and don‘t change anything.;t3_85vjq6;2;"To start this of I want to let you know that english isn‘t my native language and if you don‘t understand something please ask and I‘ll try to clarify it, because I really need help.

I don‘t know whether this is the correct sub to post this on or not. I‘m constantly lurking on subs like getdisciplined, LPT, malelivingspace and fitness. So I‘ve already tried to change everything in my life basically. It just didn‘t work. I always get back to procrastinating as always.

First of all I want to tell you more about me. So maybe a little insight can help you trying to help me.
When I was approx 13 years old I was in grade 8 of the Gymnasium (German equivalent of the High School) and had a couple of friends in my class and I was a little bit overweight. But I still haven‘t had a problem going to school and learning a little bit in my free time. The only thing I didn’t do was sports. On a random day I started to get stomachaches. I‘ve started going less and less to school. People in my class and Grade started to bully me because of that. I’ve lost basically all of my friends during that time. I got very shy and started playing more and more video games. Because of the stomachaches I never really got out of my room. But also on days when I haven’t had any I stayed at home because I didn’t want to get bullied. So as time goes on I was in grade 9. I did that grade twice because I didn’t show up often enough to get to grade 10. And even the second time in grade 9 I even went less, even though my stomachache problem was better. I lost a lot of weight during that time I had stomachaches everyday. And after I got told that they wouldn’t let me into grade 10 the second time I changed school. A school where you have to do two years and get your Mittlere Reife. Mittlere Reife is like the 3rd best degree you can have here. I found friends there again and my stomachaches got better and better. But since grade 9 I lost the ability to study. Mittlere Reife was easy for me though even without learning at all. I even got one of the best degrees of the whole grade. I also found a girl I really loved. But we never were a couple. A really good feeling in a long time for me. After this school I gave another shot at the Gymnasium. This Time I have to do 3 years to get my degree. I found a lot of friends due to the new school. And had my first and only girlfriend in my class. But we only were like 5 months a couple because I was scared I could hurt her and thought I wasn’t good enough for her. That’s why I broke up with her. So I hurt her after all. After this relationship my grades went downhill and I still haven’t recovered. I started to love 2 girls in the last 2 years after the relationship. Both of them only wanted me as a friend. Even though you could tell that the last one definitely played with me. But I’m still friends with both. Now everyday I sit in the class room I think about the last one. She is also in my class so I can’t help myself but look at her a couple of times. I really can’t concentrate on the lessons. In only 3 weeks I have my finals. Some people started to learn for that 3 months ago. But I can’t help myself and procrastinate every minute I got. I didn’t even study for the exam in 2 days. I tried to study 2 hours today but I just found myself procrastinating and doing nothing at all. Most of the time on reddit, youtube or just thinking about the last girl I wanted to be my girlfriend. And because my grades are so bad currently, this is my last hope of getting those alright. But I just don’t know how. If I fail my finals I probably drop out of school because I’m already like 2 years older than most of my classmates and last time I had to redo a class it broke me. 


**So to sum it a little bit up:**

The good thing I got friends again. And I’m socializing.
The bad thing. I can’t stop procrastinating and my grades are really bad.
Also I want to get into Fitness but every time I start to exercise I stopped after 2 weeks at max. 


So my problem is the exam in 2 days. How can I get myself to learn for that. Most of the people say just sit down and do it. Well as I already told you I tried to do that today. Learned for like 10 minutes and went straight to just sitting there for 2 hours doing nothing.

And my main problems are the finals in 3 weeks. How can I get prepared for that? Because I know I’ll find myself procrastinating again. Either on YouTube, Reddit or thinking about this girl…

I don’t know if anyone can help me but this is probably my last shot before I’ll completely brake again.

Thanks in advance though.";1;"A good start might be prioritizing and setting concrete goals instead of vague ones. Try this: 

- write 25 dream goals. Things you want to have, do, learn, and achieve. Try to make them as specific as you can. 
-circle the 5 most important ones. 
-you may now only work on those 5 things. This will force you to prioritize and concentrate your energy on what matters instead of wasting it. When you accomplish one of your 5 goals then you can go back to your list and pick a new one. 

Now to focus on those 5 goals, write down exactly what you need to do to achieve each one. ""I need to do my homework every day"" or ""I need to do these bodyweight exercises every day"" 
 
The best way to create lasting change is creating a habit. Try habit-stacking like ""Every day when I get home from school, I will immediately sit down and do my homework."" Plan a reward for after like ""After I finish my homework I'll relax and play video games."" This is called a a habit loop, with a cue (getting home) habit (doing homework) and reward (playing video games) 

Next, track progress in a visual way. You might use a calendar and put a check mark for each day you successfully do a habit, or keep a journal, or use an app to log workouts, whatever. 

Check in every week or month and write down a sentence or more about each of your goals and how things are going. 

Remember 
- self-criticism  is correlated with LESS motivation while self compassion (talking to yourself in a kind and supportive way, like you would with a friend) is correlated with greater motivation and control.
- self control is empathy with your future self.

Thanks in advance though.";1;"FYI, the more disciplined people are the ones who can spend hours just paying attention to their breathing.  That's cause they have a lot of control over their stress and rewards system.  They can stay calm while exercising.  They can stay calm while studying.

And their stress systems do not send autonomous ""desperation"" signals to other people's stress systems.  Really, we can **smell** desperation.  And unless you've got a lot of calm-relaxation wiring in your brain, your stress system will mirror other people's stress systems too much.  And vice versa.

If you act shy and hesitant around other people, you'll get the same treatment in return.  This is called **Mirroring**.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_(psychology)

In a nutshell, I recommend you start with increasing control over your very stress response via mediation / breathing exercises.";1;1.0;[[0.95080865]];[[0.43021916]];0.9819;0.121;0.809;0.07;-0.8769;0.086;0.754;0.16;0.125;0.09770513352705136;0.10208333333333333;-0.004378199806281957

I can't wrap my head around the reality that studying/reading/exercising for ONLY 10-15 minutes in a single day is somehow going to get me to a point where I'm able to do it for hours and completely change and improve my lifestyle. 

To add to that, it also feels like I don't have enough to time to go from 10-15 minutes and slowly/gradually increase that time to a point where I think it'd be beneficial to me. In my head, I think it'd take probably months if not a year or two to successfully reach a point where I'm able to discipline myself enough to study for 2-3 hours and keep that focus on being productive.

I really just need to hear that it's worth it to embrace the tiny changes and that it pays off immensely over time. 

Thank you. ";8;"For me the **small goals guarantee wins**. You make your GOAL to do 10-15 minutes. If you do that it is a win and that makes you feel good.

Here is the best part. 

You can and often will do MORE than your small goal. Once you have that 10-15 minutes done you might be on a roll, you might go for up to an hour! Or...you might not and you will stop after the 10-15 minutes and **you will still feel like you met your goal**.

Contrast that with a goal of 2 hours per day. Are you going to feel good if you do 1.5 hours? You didn't meet your goal after all. Whether you take it hard or shrug it off, the fact that you didn't meet your own expectations of yourself will have a negative effect on your subconscious.

&amp;nbsp;

**My testimonial:**

Since February of last year my goal was 1 pomodoro of working on something I felt resistance to every day. I [tracked it in a google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mEF3LKMs8I5OfThv4sQKIA4xmoBNe6iwfahEK5XRMIQ/edit) because I wanted to see how I was doing and that helped a ton. You can quickly scan my tracking sheet and see how often I exceeded my small goal.

Hope my take helps you make your own small goals! It wasn't the motivation for my goal, but check out The Compound Effect for some more reading in this area (reading non-fiction is actually a direct result of my small goal).";3;0.375;[[0.97304473]];[[0.73596523]];0.9891;0.152;0.833;0.016;0.8323;0.068;0.904;0.027999999999999997;0.096;0.0698489010989011;0.20833333333333331;-0.13848443223443224

Thank you. ";8;"For a long time, I'd wanted to start reading more fiction. I'd put it off endlessly because I would set high-inertia daily goals and my mindset was like yours. Finally, I caved to the ""start small"" philosophy, and decided to read 10 pages per day. After a couple days, I felt 10 pages was actually too short, so I'd read more than that. But the extra pages were supplementary; it was the first 10 that mattered. Those 10 pages not only gave me an easy daily goal but provided the momentum to continue.

Providing momentum is the point of those small, daily goals. Usually, you'll finish them and have the momentum to continue. Some days, you'll feel lazy or be busy, so you won't continue past the goal, but at least at the end of the day, you can say, ""I accomplished at least one goal today.""";2;0.25;[[0.97997411]];[[0.65387092]];0.9891;0.152;0.833;0.016;0.5106;0.051;0.927;0.022000000000000002;0.107;0.0698489010989011;-0.001811594202898552;0.07166049530179965

Thank you. ";8;"My advice would just be start.

I wholeheartedly agree with /u/EliteoftheRad 's comment predicting that once you find that 10-15 mins per day to work on something important to you it will quickly prove to be insufficient and so you will **make** more time and consequently will **achieve more**.


**My Example - learning web development**


At the start of last year (2016) I set a goal that I would complete one web development course by the end of the year. Every day I would wake up 30 mins earlier and work on this before my day job.

Within a few weeks this became so interesting that I was waking at 5am (most days - beers the night before would always mess my up) to learn to code.

Guess what? By the end of the year my one course goal was blown out the water! I had completed three courses; learned almost 10 different web technologies; and built a web app to manage my personal goals, habits, and budget which my friends are also now using (www.SuccessOnTap.io) and may one day become a business!

The purpose of the above is not to brag. It is to say that maybe had I not started small with my 20-30 mins per morning I would not have achieved what I did.

So, once again, just go for it! 

Feel free to get in touch if you want to talk more about this subject. I also strongly believe that if you work on something important and meaningful for you it will make everything much easier!";2;0.25;[[0.97566062]];[[0.65551039]];0.9891;0.152;0.833;0.016;0.9646;0.098;0.892;0.01;0.048;0.0698489010989011;0.20085227272727274;-0.13100337162837164

Thank you. ";8;"In a video, Tony Robbins explains that you have beliefs about your potential. What you believe your potential is will lead to certain actions. Those actions will give you results. And those results shape your beliefs, starting the cycle again.

If you start demanding too much from yourself, your results will be poor. That will demoralize you. You will believe that you are not capable of that much. Many people get so frustrated that they don’t keep trying at all, so their beliefs remain the same. Then they get inspired and, again, go for a change that demands too much and, again, the results are disappointing. This creates a downward spiral, a vicious circle.

On the other hand, when you try some baby steps, you’ll probably get some good results (because it was too easy). These results, small as they are, will change your beliefs (a little) of how far you can go successfully. This gives you a little greater image of your potential. The new image of your potential will get you to try some new actions (longer baby steps, if you will), which will probably give you good results (because, again, your asking just a little bit more from yourself). And those results will be the base for new beliefs about your potential, and so on. This creates an upward spiral, a virtuous circle.

I understand that you don’t feel that this is a change that will improve your life significantly. One way that I like to think about it is that, if you do nothing, your life will go on in a straight line to the right. But if you do a little each day, even if it’s almost nothing, you change your course upwards by an angle of three degrees. Three degrees is not much in the short term. But in the long term, fifteen years from now, you will be in a significantly higher position, relative to your do-nothing-about-it horizontal line.";1;0.125;[[0.97514303]];[[0.58333714]];0.9891;0.152;0.833;0.016;0.9366;0.1;0.85;0.05;0.08600000000000001;0.0698489010989011;0.0351810790835181;0.034667822015382994
[NeedAdvice] My Life;t3_86ubip;2;I’m a 21 years old guy who is suffering in being a normal guy. Currently I’m in university I don’t have a girlfriend I don’t know whether it is because of my poor social skills or I’m being arrogant as I’m too shy to talk to a girl and when I talk I think about my English “International University” and then I forget what I should say. And when I plan for things as I learned from productivity sites I get depressed if it didn’t go with what I planned for example In the begging of the semester I was excited I will review that I will do that but in reality, I didn’t do anything except procrastinating and in the end, I get depressed. I always think that I know everything but, I don’t know shit. I buy a lot of books, but I didn’t read a single book I pretend to read but I don’t. I’m trying to be perfect and that I think what is destroying me. I quit social media because I think it is a fake life but in the same time I don’t have anything to do as I always wanted to develop myself as a software engineer student I bought many courses from Udemy and different sites, but I didn’t go through them. I always care about productivity but in the middle of the day I get frustrated and lost it all. Most of friends know that I lake social skills and that fucking embarrassing. And the most thing I hate about me is when I get depressed or stressed I will fap and this is killing me from the inside as each day pass I tell myself I will be a better person after relapsing. I need help badly ;5;"First relax, and BREATHE.  Whenever you get stressed try to remember to take a short moment (couple minutes) to breathe deeply and slowly.  When people become stressed they start shallow breathing without realizing it.  You might be in a situation where you are breathing shallow 24 hours a day.  Meditation also focuses on breathing, but if that's too much just try to take a few minutes to breathe deeply and slowly.  Hold it in for 2 seconds and release the air slowly.

""Suffering in being a normal guy"".  There is nothing wrong with being normal.  Stop being so hard on yourself.  Would you ridicule someone else for being normal?  Of course you wouldn't so stop doing it to yourself.  Also keep in mind that you are the only one who is judging you on being normal.  People don't look at you that way.  And if they do it's none of your business.  

Perfectionism will kill you.  Seriously.  Do a google search on Dr. Sarno and Tension Myositus Syndrome.  Trying to be perfect or even a people pleaser can cause sickness and random pain in the body.  It's very interesting.  The best part is that it's not a rocket science.  All you have to do is stop trying to be perfect.  If you catch yourself trying to be perfect try to remember that no one is perfect.  And it's not worth the headache or hassle to try to be perfect.

Here's why you are lacking social skills.  Because you aren't working on it.  You may believe it comes natural for people, but in reality they've been working at it so long that it comes naturally.  I'm going to share something with you that I think is extremely important.  GO OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.  FACE YOUR FEARS!  What do I mean?  Start talking to random girls.  Not with the intension of getting into a relationship, but to work on your social skills.  Some girls think social awkwardness is cute.  You have to do this though.  You have to start doing this and I know it's terrifying.  It's absolutely terrifying that you might embarrass yourself.  But you know what's an even stronger feeling?  That feeling that YOU DID IT!  You literally will be so pleased with yourself for going out of your comfort zone that the results won't matter.  You made an ass out of yourself?  Who cares!  THAT WAS AWESOME!  I'm telling you.  It's an amazing feeling.  You will want to do it more.   This builds up momentum so the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time continue to become easier.

If you want to become an absolute machine with social skills I have a mastery course that I normally sell for $2,000.  However I'll be glad to discount it for you at $500.  I'm joking, LOL. Just trying to lighten up this post.

Be honest with yourself right now.  Are you confident?  From your post I would say you don't seem to be.  Girls are attracted to confident guys who know who they are and know what they want.  No worries pal.  The good thing is that you don't have a Girlfriend right now, because it's not important right now.  You need to work on yourself first.  You want to get to a point in life where you are happy with yourself.  Then when you get a Girlfriend you can both share your amazing lives together.  I can guarantee you that getting a Girlfriend doesn't magically make life better.  This is why working on yourself is most important.  Get to that point where having a Girlfriend will just add value to your life, but not define it.

Quitting social media was a great move.  It's fake just like you said.  And if you fall into the trap of comparing your life to their ""perfect"" life you are going to be miserable.

In regards to procrastination.  I don't have a great answer for you as we do all do this for different reasons.  Personally I've been a gamer for 35+ years.  I recently stopped and I'm selling everything.  When it was time for me to be honest with myself I realized that gaming allowed me to put my life on hold.  I'm now focusing more on what I always wanted to.  Drums.

In regards to Fap.  It's not a big deal as long as you aren't doing it multiple times on a daily basis.  Don't even worry about that or focus on that.  You are not a bad person if you fap.  Actually you need to do this somewhat often as your body needs to function properly.  If you completely ignore it you may run into health issues.

I can't stress this enough.  Be kind to yourself.  Relax, take it easy.  Set small goals.  Try to be a better version of yourself compared to last month.  Don't compare yourself to others EVER.  Only compare to yourself in the past.

I'm double your age and have been through a lot.  I completely get the struggle.  Trust me.  I hope at least one thing here will help you.  Please reply if you'd like or if you want to take this to a personal conversation just send me a message.  I'd be glad to chat with you.

Long story short... train martial arts. Training kickboxing and BJJ literally fixed 95% of those issues for me. It taught me confidence and discipline. It’s also unbelievable exercise, which is another great way to combat this destructive mindset.  

Like I said, it’s anecdotal, but there are a myriad of other similar stories out there.

I'm someone who was very smart in middle school as well as high school. 4.0 GPA, 99% test scores, 5's across the board on my AP test. Got into a UC studying STEM. I am currently 27 and jobless with a long list of mistakes behind me.

There's nothing wrong with being average. As people mature, those who put in genuine effort pull leaps and bounds ahead while those who rely on their natural gifts fall behind. This was true in college: I thought I was above average in intelligence, and while this may have been true, I needed to spend a lot more time studying than playing video games. I played games instead and nearly flunked out, graduated barely with a terrible GPA and no job. I thought I was competent when I was in school. Now that I'm out in the real world, things are not as forgiving. Companies ask me, ""*So Mr. RomanticPanda, what have you been doing with **your time**?*"" I'm always left scrambling for an explanation of why I haven't been putting in the same hard work as my compatriots, why I don't have the experience under my belt.

The thing I didn't realize is, **I'm average too.** And that means I need to try hard as well. What is important is that you put in consistent effort, that you treat people with respect and befriend as many as you can, and that you make consistent progress. Because someday, someone who didn't put in that work will look at you with envy. Like I am looking at my friends at the moment.

Many of them didn't score as well as me back in school. Many of them probably thought they weren't ""as good"" as I was, as others who were smarter were. The thing is, they did it. And so can you.

[NeedAdvice] No longer sure how to improve myself;t3_7xex7q;3;"Unlike many people who post on this subreddit, I don't have a problem with discipline. Sure, I'll have the odd day here and there where I'll feel lazy, but it never lasts long. I have that at least going for me.

However, I've reached a point in my life where I'm not really sure how I can further improve myself. In the last while I've finished my music degree, a goal I had been working toward for years. I play in my city's orchestra (another goal I had been working toward for a long time), have a flexible online job that I work during the day, and have plans to start a studio later this year. So now that I've achieved  all these goals that I've been working on for so long, I don't have anything to replace them with and I don't know how I can further improve my life. Unfortunately my downfall was that I never thought beyond the completion of those goals, and now that they are complete I feel a little lost (but otherwise quite content with my life).

Ultimately my question is, how do you go about setting new goals for yourself, and do you have any ideas for things I could do to further improve my life?

Trying to better myself right now, applied for a trade in the RAF that, if i'm accepted, will give me back the structure and discipline I lack. 

Cut the weed. Cut the hookers. Ration the games. Things like that make you ok with doing nothing because they fulfil a dopamine hit you crave. Find a more constructive outlet you can spend time on. 

I've started growing mushrooms (legit ones for now) and it's been exciting because it's been a whole new thing to learn/explore and get excited about, apply this to something new yourself. 

HItting the gym helps me. I train for 2 hours a day and have made some good 'gym friends' which I train with, it's a much more constructive social situation than a bar or on your sofa smoking weed and it takes time to cultivate the relationships and quite a few unsuccessful ones, but now theyre there, it's pretty set.

Save your money or spend it on mini-breaks to around europe. It's pretty cheap to go anywhere in the world now and europe is no exception. I've even seen flights from london to new york for £240. 

Take it one day at a time man, but you've gotta start by cutting the short-term solutions like weed, hookers and vidya and replacing them with structured activities. It's effort. It's daunting. It's uncomfortable and you can fail, but you eventually find yourself in a better place. 

Don't do what I did for so long and wait for that 'chemical switch' in your brain to change your outlook and perception because it will never come. You have to instiage it. Hit me up if you need someone to talk to/motivate eachother to do the things we don't wanna do. Good luck man.

-Share your thoughts with people you trust and admire. Be as honest as you feel comfortable being and listen.
- Don't quit your job. And if you really have to, plan for it. When I was going through my phase of zero motivation I completely believed that a change in career will be an obvious and quick fix. This was not the case and despite the advice I was given I quit my job without proper planning and it still remains a regret and lesson. 
- Write down your ideas and really reflect on where you want to end up mentally, professionally, financially, spiritually and socially (add categories as you see fit). Then with that in mind create a strategy to achieve your goals. 
- Outline daily, monthly and weekly goals. I'm terrible at this part as I'm a big procrastinator. I tried out a goals system where I set out to achieve 10 goals a day. Once a week (Sundays) I sit down and outline what I want to achieve each day of the week and at the end of each day I give myself a score x/10. The goal is to improve your score each week while making sure your productive. 

My weakness is that after the first weeks success, I have fallen off into unproductive old habits. But still working to get back on track and will keep refining my process. Find a process that works for you and try it out.

As an ex-regular smoker I understand that we don't want to admit it and don't want to give it up. But trust me, you're not motivationally broken, it's just the weed.

I've been in an eerily similar boat as you. I started a tech company when I was 18, made some good money, got comfortable, and started smoking weed daily at around 20. I live in WA, it's everywhere and seems harmless right? The company failed around then. I didn't realize it at the time, but in retrospect it's clear that I had lost almost all of my ambition and ended up going down the path of working salary programming jobs which made good enough money to stay comfortable, but in my opinion were far beneath my own potential.

I'm 25 now and I finally had to quit smoking weed a couple months back - I had gotten to the point where I was taking 8-10 large dabs a day and became violently sick with CHS. It really wasn't so bad after I got past the first week of boredom. My life has really changed though: I have actual energy to do things, running errands and doing housework doesn't seem like such a monumental chore anymore. I get bored now, which means I work on side projects I'm getting the itch to get back into the startup life.

The most profound takeaway I have is that, **what I look forward to each day is no longer my next easy-to-achieve high, it's what I'm doing today to improve my life tomorrow**. I still smoke during the weekends, but I can't let myself get that comfortable ever again.

[Need Advice] I have zero motivation in life. Doing mediocre, how to fix?;t3_82qpbv;23;"I literally have zero motivation in life. I'm doing fairly ok. Graduated in August 2017. Started my first job December 2017. Job is ok, I'm doing the bare minimum and have no intention whatsoever to change that. Job pays me ok. I have about €800 left each month which I waste on weed, games and hookers.
I've been smoking weed daily for the past 5 year. I work from 9 - 17. When I get off, I immediately light one up.

I'm doing fairly well on the outside. Work at a fortune 500 company, have a company paid car. Don't have to stress about money each month. Not overweight, just an average athletic body. But I'm pretty much depressed &amp; angry from the inside. Have no gf. Have a few friends which I barley talk to. 
 I used to have so much ambition and an astonishing work ethic 7 years ago. But I've the lost the ""spark"" somehow. I think it all started when I started my own company (5 yrs ago) , failed miserably and started smoking weed to cope with the stress.

I really want to get back on track. I know that I got MORE in me. My friends are doing WAY better than me in all aspects (better jobs, financially, relationships (getting engaged / married)) 

Has anyone else felt this way? The feeling that you KNOW that you could do better but you won't? ";83;"One thing I do is, i incorporate thought exercises into my commute. On the way to work there is one place where when I pass through, I wish for happiness for others. I look at strangers’ faces and wonder about what problems they are dealing with. I try to think of colleagues I’m not particularly fond of and what their home life is like, and wish them the best. 

Then, on the way home from work, there is a particularly place I pass through where I forgive myself for anything that I’m feeling bad about. I also try to think of what I am proud of that day. It doesn’t have to seem big. For you, just from what you wrote you are more accomplished than you think. Graduated and have a steady job with extra money on the side. That’s pretty dope!! Plus, the real thing to be proud of is character. Be proud of how you treat people. 

One more thing. Ask yourself, what would it look like if you really went after what you wanted in life? Ask yourself every day when you’re taking a shower. 

You won’t change overnight, and that’s ok. But every day, do one thing for your future self.  That could be making your bed in the morning so that you’ll have a nice bed to come home to at night. That could be doing some sort of adult shit like taxes that you’ve been putting off. It could be making a decision you’ve been dreading. It could be calling a parent. It could be googling something you’ve been interested in trying. It could be 10 push-ups or 1 minute of meditation or sending a message to a girl you like. Just do one thing, however small, each day. It doesn’t have to accomplish anything. You just have to slowly train yourself to take on your reality rather than spending so much energy escaping from it.

";83;If you want something that will actually change you dramatically then you should change your life. Like not your just your job or your habits or some shit. Designate 2-3 years of your life to put yourself in a situation where you can’t afford to be nihilistic about anything because you have to focus on basics like food and shelter and you’ll come out of that experience knowing where your foundations are, how you react under pressure, and you’ll understand yourself better. I didn’t try for years because I never really had to and always skated just right above the poverty line. Sink. You’ll find out when you’re actually hungry how much control you can have over yourself. If you want dramatic change take dramatic action because the smart way with long term benefits is a long term commitment and we both know by this point that you just won’t commit to that. Or you could read reddit comments about fucking dieting and self reflection, I’ve just found that since I am an expert procrastinator that I procrastinated a major phase life development until it collapsed inwards on me, whether you painfully draw it out over decades or commit to it Change will find you and it has no commitment to treat you kindly. ;3;0.03614457831325301;[[0.94078433]];[[0.67558704]];0.7609999999999999;0.11800000000000001;0.8170000000000001;0.065;0.8885;0.133;0.7959999999999999;0.071;-0.009000000000000022;0.14333333333333334;-0.03356481481481481;0.1768981481481482

Has anyone else felt this way? The feeling that you KNOW that you could do better but you won't? ";83;"Man. Thats an awful situation to be in. Im not kidding. To have so much financial and professional stability at such a tremendously young age and not realize the scope nor magnitude of that potential is just a tremendous waste. Here's the catch. You know it. You absolutely know that your fortunate and could do better(you've also earned it btw) and now that you know it, you have to ask yourself **""How long is it going to be before I'm convinced, that I will regret very deeply, having consciously squandered an opportunity (You put it on reddit.) to create a life of real substance and meaning not just for myself but for the people that I know I will care about. My wife and children who I could have had a real bond with. The generational successors who could have taken the values i never bothered to develop and used in combination with a very well designed inheritence, Shifted and elevated the ground on which my generational legacy stands , all that now lost forever, because I was comfortable.""**

The theatrics are to emphasis the unimaginable scope of both what it is you could potentially accomplish and how much regret you'd feel knowing you had an opportunity to set up future generations for success not only with familial wealth, But the structural values that determine how the money is expected to be viewed and managed. It isnt there for your children and great grandchildren to do as they please. Its there to be used as a vehicle for the further acquisition of wealth and a more well developed set of values to govern the next transfer... This is how the elite members  the human race frame their existence. Truly wealthy familys are rich by design. They understand that the only vehicle by which continuous generational growth can occur is by **making certain values sacred** . And that they are instilled permanently in your children by forming a genuine bond that just convinces them **""I hold my values sacred because they came from my father who I knew couldn't die in peace until I myself convinced him that these sacred truths are safe in my hands. You've prepared me my entire life and I absolute understand whats at stake "" **
Family values are not meant to be suggestions. There meant to be declarations. And there suppose to be thought about everytime you feel uncertain about the right path. They have to be developed, believed and firmly imbedded in the ethos you use to guide your life. Its a tall order. You'll have several opportunities to be convinced the easy way... But eventually (probably when you marry the wrong person or knock up some broad you dont like) life will teach you the hard way and take all your nice shit away from you. this will rinse and repeat until you figure it out or you die having accomplished nothing. Families that really take the time to teach their children that ""wasting opportunitys because you are lazy and don't appreciate whats been given to you (great parents im assuming... head start)"" is one of the errors of character a person can make. It takes away from your childrens potential and basically makes your existence a tragedy, because even with all the tools you couldnt build a life with some type of noble purpose.

You want some motivation?
You'll get it when something happens due to your apathy that takes all of your comforts away. 
I was extremely selfish and egotistical, accomplishing great things with nothing but pure ego and no other purpose than to serve myself... Then life did a great thing. It took everything away from me and showed me what it meant to suffer. Went from MD/PHD program to IV heroin/coke fiend almost immediately for about 2-3 years before I landed in jail and was given an opportunity to rebuild the foundation of who i am with the values and principles of my own choosing.
So, yea... I'm very motivated. And my sense of obligation stretches as far as I can imagine. It demands of me that I never go back to a person who cannot find a good reason to reach my full potential. I'm 30 and feel that fucking Pain and destruction was just the absolute most important moment of my life (I was much much worse by the way). Only true suffering of your own doing can convince you that this is not  the way I'm suppose to live my life. Hopefully you can find meaning in a positive way. That usually requires mentorship that it seems you don't have. Take some Brazilian Jiu jitsu classes, It will teach you that great satisfaction and self awareness is attained when you discipline yourself and give to others.

Has anyone else felt this way? The feeling that you KNOW that you could do better but you won't? ";83;"i have advice for you.
please follow it as you have got this and only you can control your life.

pray minimum 4 times a day - morning , afternoon , evening , night.
first ask for forgiveness for all your sins till the point in time of your prayer.
next - pray for your string desires to come true.
pray for your loved ones
pray to say thanks - you have screwed up so much still you are safe/alive - much worse could have easily happened due to your actions - so someone has got your back - say thanks to that someone.
pray for other people/humanity who could be suffereing much more right now.

do not touch harmful substances - it is all poison.

do not indulge in any form of sex / fap.
you need all your energies to come on track

excercise a lot - as much as possible

sleep a lot

eat good stuff

talk as less as possible - only right stuff at right time comes out from your mouth.

try to travel if you got money , time.

observe your thoughts in all directions - they are all the lies you got programmed with. the ideal state is that of no thought / no mind.

good luck. my very best wishes.

We are content to be discontent with a life where food clothing and shelter are abundant. There is more to life isn't there? And deep down inside you know there is a simple solution. 

“Simple: It is important to simplify the way you see and know life, because it is the only way it can be known. It can be almost infinitely complicated, and trying to understand it all is what mankind is trying to do. We have to go the other way and see and know it in the most simple way, because it is the only way we can know all that can be known. We can never know all the details, they are infinite and it is impossible, but we can know the simple big picture of life. That is what this book attempts to do.""

Your life in college is just a fraction of your future. You should care less about it. Sure, it sucks to have no one to talks too, or no one to hang with. But it's such a small and temporary issues that you should not weight your success in life around it.

Since you ask on /r/getdisciplined, I would recommend to try to avoid those Issues, and focus on getting your shit together.

* Make plan for a whole day. You have stay at school for lunch or between classes? Make sure you have a plan. Study. Read. Learn. Draw. Gym. Sports. Watever. Don't stay alone wandering. Add new activity if you feel you have some energy for it! STOP WANDERING ALONE.

* You are in college to learn and get in the workforce. Not to make friends. I understand it sucks, but really the best you can do is focus on yourself and stop comparing yourself to everyone.

* If you do care about making friends so much, take note that friends are more easily made when you share a common interest. Sports? D&amp;D at lunch break? whatever fits you. But if you don't want to stay alone, participate in anything that fits your interest. Things will go naturally from here. 


Thinking down on you is incredibly dangerous and stupid. For anything that is a trouble for you right now. NONE will even remotely exist 5 years from now. If you are not able to clear those thoughts by yourself, PLEASE CONSULT BUDDY! They know how to help, and it will change your life for the best, I promise. I really recommend to focus on your study and make sure you complete your college successfully. Once you are done, the only thing that with follow you out of college, is your grade, knowledge and ambition.

They were very negative and probably made my depression worse. I attempted suicide, ran away, threw everything away, and thought my life was over. I didn’t see any hope or future for myself.

It’s now 13 years later and I’ve rebuilt a life for myself that’s better than I could have imagined. In a way feeling like I had nothing allowed me to rebuild exactly the life I wanted for myself.

The one powerful thing you have on your side when it seems like you are at the bottom is that you can stop caring about what others think and live for yourself. If you were thinking of ending it, then why not first try doing exactly what you want? You have nothing to lose right? Chase that dream even if it means throwing something you “should” be doing away.

The other thing I learned is that it’s always better to ask for help early than to wait until consequences catch up. If you are depressed, go to a doctor, tell someone in your family just how bad it is, be brutally honest or they won’t know you need help.

I don't have all the answers for you, but take it from a guy who had to do some serious self-examination and major changes to his own life: it can be done. It will not be easy, especially at first. 
The best tool to start with, at least for me, oddly enough, was diet. I wasn't even overly out of shape, or all that overweight, but my nutrition still sucked, and it's amazing how much proper nutrition can start to change your perspective on absolutely everything. There are nutritional supplements that can be used as tools to help to balance your moods (Ashwagandha, vitamin D, Ginko, St. John's Wort) but they can't do everything.
On top of that: sunlight, exercise (I recommend yoga, but any kind of exercise will help) and then meditation. Once your body and hormonal balance is healthier, your emotions will balance out much more easily as well, and once your body and emotions are receptive to change, your mind and spirit will be better able to follow suit.
Once your mind and spirit change, it will change everything about you: how you feel, how you look, how you interact with people. It will give you confidence as well, but there's no use having confidence without first having clarity, and direction.
I would wish you luck, but as I've discovered, luck has nothing to do with it. 
You will get there, only as long as you consciously decide to move forward; it will go slowly at first, but it will be worth the effort.

I'm a 26 year old Master student, and the course is really helping me become a better person - by dint of not giving me a God damn choice. 

I used to have a career before enrolling, and even that cannor compare with the load I'm carring right now; this is by far the busiest I've ever been. Even when waking up early and prioritizing my education over everything else, I'm only managing to get by.

I'm a 26 year old Master student, and the course is really helping me become a better person - by dint of not giving me a God damn choice. 

I used to have a career before enrolling, and even that cannor compare with the load I'm carring right now; this is by far the busiest I've ever been. Even when waking up early and prioritizing my education over everything else, I'm only managing to get by.

My grades are okay-ish, the faculty seems to have some respect for me, deadlines are mostly met and I'm getting enough work to not starve. Things are measurably well, so when I start panicking I can fall back on that knowledge to keep me grounded. But here's the thing: I'd like to do better than okay.

When I have oversight (during class, at work, being part of groups) I can do well - respectably, even - but when I'm supposed to handle it on my own (homework, assignments, personal scheduling) it's a disaster. I will always make the choice that fucks me over rather than the one that helps me, whether for fun, a misguided understanding of what I'm supposed to do, overzealousness or a sheer perverted sense of self-sabotage. I've been trying to do better and choose better but the results are mixed at best.

Thank you all.";58;"Really, the only way is to get help from others.

Then let your parents read it.

Make a plan for what you want to do with your life, you have an amazing future in front of you even if you can't see it now. 

Do these results really matter to you for what you want in life, or do they mainly matter to your parents and teachers?

Remember that people being hard on you means they care about you!

Remember that if everyone becomes a doctor or a lawyer, the world is totally screwed. The world needs people to do all sorts of jobs to keep society working, you have a place in it, a place that no one else can fill for you, you just need to figure out where it is (and know that you can change your mind about what you want and where you fit if the first thing you try doesn't work out! Or the second, or third)

Are you getting enough sleep? Exercise? Do you have a healthy diet with all the nutrients your body needs (and your brain!). Do you have good ways to relax and unwind?

Why are you not getting the grades you would like to get? Too much stress making you freeze? Lack of sleep?  It's it graded on a curve, or by amount of correct/incorrect answers?
How and when are you studying? (I've found ""how to be a straight A student"" a very helpful book). Are you cramming the night before or do you evenly spread out the course load? 

Seems like you're good at maths, languages and biology.

Start learning Python and see if Data Analyst is a job you would like. /r/learnpython and  /r/dataisbeautiful 

No history or chemistry needed. ;)

I find my students often study constantly but don’t actually know HOW to study. You can put the hours in, but if you’re not focusing on the right things then you might find your progress isn’t improving as much as you’d like.

Just a question- have you shown progress in any of your classes? - what did you do to succeed in these? 

I would reach out to your tutors and teachers about specific revision skills rather than content skills. These will differ depending on the course.

Before pursuing the ""disability"" thought, you might just need to go about it differently. This book cites scientific research done in the area of learning and recall and challenges many common study techniques that feel right, but don't produce the expected results in research studies. This is only a suggestion. It is enlightening, though. The book is co-written by a professional story teller, which helps to bring the many case studies to life. You might want to skip to the last chapter about Tips for Students to see a couple of case studies that might encourage you.

I wish I had this information available to me when I was in school. I teach a programming class now, and I see a lot of success in the students that are unwittingly doing some of the things described in this book to improve recall. I also have students who ""read and re-read the lecture materials"" who don't actually do as well when it comes to sitting down and programming something simple at the keyboard.

/rant";59;"I feel like you are where I was ten years ago.

I'm going to start by addressing this little voice that you have inside your head saying that you are crap. The one that wrote your post. Be conscious of it. It is just a voice. I don't know where it originally came from (your parents? school bullies?), but now it is in you, like a cancer. That voice is your enemy. If you let it run wild it will destroy your youth.

Try to be nice to yourself. So you suck at the gym? It sounds like you don't like it anyway. I started going to the gym when I was your age and tried to fit in, but I never liked it. I haven't gone to a gym since I was 17. Instead I joined an Olympic Weightlifting club, an activity I really liked. Nowadays I'm more interested in calisthenics. My point is, there's lots of ways to be in shape, out of which the gym is the most mediocre and factory-like I can think of. So many guys going to the gym, perfect bodies but dead inside. I used to suck at sports in school (I was the last one to get picked for team sports), but later in life I found that dance, gymnastics and more welcoming atmospheres really suited me, and I'm probably the fittest out of my former classmates these days, not that it matters one bit. 

So be nice to yourself, don't bully yourself into going to the gym if you don't want to, if you feel you've tried it and you don't like it then move on. Maybe there's a cool parkour club where you live? Also, accept that you might not like something at the beginning and that appreciating something requires some skill and knowledge of the subject at hand.

Next, school. Your grades are not that bad. You are again putting yourself down. You had a tutor for a few hours a week and you thought you would get all A's? It sounds to me like you were behind in your abilities and you managed to catch up after a spurt. When I was your age I thought it was all about me. As I grew older I realised I didn't have a particularly good learning environment. For example, some kids have parents that spend lots of time with them, teaching them study skills and helping them, something I never had. You know, like Elon Musk's dad who is an engineer. Also, my school seemed really good to me at the time, but looking back I realised most of my teachers kinda sucked. 

So instead of being all pessimistic and stuff about this, be nice to yourself. We have the internet these days. Look for resources you like online. If your tutor is expensive (or you just don't like him) look for an online tutor from India. For something like the A-Levels using SRS software like Anki should work well. Also the A-Levels are kind of boring, but nothing prevents you from taking higher level courses. I hated A-Level Maths (and failed miserably), but the MIT university level stuff that treats you like a smart human as opposed to a dumb zombie is really nice. Lots of us feel like our education really started when we left university. 

I'm serious about the voice inside your head, though. Be aware of it. Don't be it's slave. If you don't like something maybe be patient or try something else but don't start telling yourself you suck. Don't let anyone control you or put you down.";2;0.03389830508474576;[[0.98084352]];[[0.66657305]];-0.9419;0.053;0.8029999999999999;0.14400000000000002;0.9857;0.159;0.7290000000000001;0.11199999999999999;-0.138;-0.1109375;0.0540500908556464;-0.1649875908556464

Remember failure is effectively an opportunity to learn from your mistakes.If what you are doing isn't working change what you're doing. Learn how to learn. It sounds stupid, but fucking believe in yourself. It's okay to ask for help. Attitude is everything...

/rant";59;Well you definitely did well on some subjects, especially math. Most people actually struggle with Mathematics so clearly you don't have a brain problem lol. Go to YouTube and type in flow TedTalks. It's this state of mind that you get into. For subjects like history (something you did poor in) It could become hard to focus. In math you are doing practise questions and using your brain to solve problems. While studying try to find mock questions and try to answer them. The only way your brain will focus is if it's being stimulated. You have to engage it in questions where you have to do critical thinking.

/rant";59;You need to develop good test taking skills along with knowing the material. What I do when I study is read the chapter while writing important points down to condense information into what is absolutely necessary. I do the practice problems, and then look at my notes from the class. If I do not understand something from the book or from the lecture I look it up online, ask friends if they understand it better, ask my teacher, or ask a tutor. I get all of this information verbally, or from reading it. I also write all of this stuff down. For one test I do about 20 hours of studying, which covers about 3 weeks of class time. For a comprehensive exam I would expect to study a bit more per subject. I call this method the brute force method. As long as you review the material, and check to see if you understand the concepts you will learn the material. This is how I got my Master's degree in chemistry.

Thanks!";3;"Well I definitely sugest sleeping earlier so that you can get a nights worth of undisturbed and uninterrupted sleep meaning you don't have any ambient noise or lights in your room and that you can wake up without an alarm.

Also switch up your routine and maybe focus on other exercises like running or bodyweight training.

The suggestions come from guessing that the novelty of being a freshman in college has worn off and you are likely bored since you have been doing the same routine for months without seeing much progress.

Finally, reflect on why you want to work out.  From personal experience the most dedicated and consistent individuals are the ones who are training for a specific goal like an athletic competition.   Most of the folks that ive meet that train for vanity reasons are usually the most inconsistent and are always in and out or never to be seen again.

I believe his website has quite a bit of information actually.

&amp;nbsp;

**Basics that I remember:**

Habits have 3 parts -- CUE | ROUTINE | REWARD

The first thing to do is start figuring out your CUE. What is causing you to bite your lip? You do this by taking a notecard and making an X on it anytime you bite your lip. Then you examine what caused you to do it.

What this does is pull the subconscious habit into your conscious mind and allow you to examine it and hopefully change your ROUTINE. As /u/Shepard526 suggests, you could try changing your ROUTINE to rubbing your lips together.

As others have said this is by no means medical advice, just what I learned about habits from the book.

";14;"Hi, I used to be just like you. In high school I cheated, did bare minimum in school without any effort whatsoever. These tactics landed me into community college (community college is fucking great - I'll fight whoever disagrees.) Obviously there is stigma with community college and people were starting to view me as your standard ""peaked in High School"" kind of person. I really didn't want to be that - I'm sure you don't either. So I made it my goal to set huge fucking goals for myself. My sophomore year in college I decided I wanted to study medicine. I had to take calculus, biochemistry, physics, organic chemistry, etc. Classes that my entire life I either cheated through or was told I was ""too stupid"" to understand. So I just started studying like crazy. I started to rewrite my notes. I had terrible handwriting while taking notes, and when I got home from class I would write and rewrite my notes. I added colors, made charts in a note book, used a different color pen for emphasis on words. I got obsessed the world of the Study Tumblr - it's very helpful. The most important thing to do is fucking start. Stop making excuses for yourself and just sit down and start doing the work. Start somewhere. Watch YouTube videos on how to do a problem and just log off. You're making a decision to either better yourself or not every time you do something. Help yourself. Don't let yourself fail. It shouldn't be an option for you. I would block out 2 hour blocks each day and just study. I rotated material, studied in different places. Recorded my self talking about my material and listened to it on a walk outside. Practice. Practice. Practice. If it's math - make up your own problems with the methods you're using. Solve your own problems. Try someone else's worksheets. Every bit of practice helps. Trust me. I was told my entire life that I would never amount to anything and I graduated college with a 4.0. I took a really awesome job in an Ivy League College's laboratory. I'm back in school for an Informatics degree. Just do the work. And most importantly you gotta believe in yourself. Remind your self that you fucking can do it. Only you are holding you back. Remember that.

";14;"I now what you go through quite a bit. I'm in the same situation: thought I was special and smart, didn't have to do anything in order to stay on track and had everything provided by my parents. 
What you and I have to realise is that people don't come with a set of personality traits, rather they develop them. That means that you might have been the smarter one in high school or in elementary school, but that doesn't mean you will be forever. I read this advice on this subreddit: you have to start to think about being smart as being hardworking. This is incredibly hard, because as you have said you have never done anything meaningful by yourself, but if you continue like that you never will. Your parents won't be able to support you through your whole life. You might get by cheating, but you will never have a fulfilling life like this. You've got to make an effort and that's hard, if you got used to not doing shit all the time (believe me, I know). 
You said you have three months of free time, right? What you need to do is make a plan. Start by a list of what you want to accomplish during the three months. Do you want to take up coding again? Do you want to learn to take integrals? Do you want to have a routine of studying or exercising? Write up every little thing you would like to do and then prioritize. Make them into specific goals, but don't expect miracles; years of doing nothing is hard to undo. Have monthly and weekly plans for the entire three months; you can change them later when you see how it goes, but have a guideline. 
What you have to get into is making an effort, putting in hard work. You have to be committed to the plan and you have to follow through, otherwise you will be back to square one. This really depends on whether you actually want to change or if it's okay for you to not create and evolve at all.

[Need advice] Need help changing my habits and start studying;t3_849wep;4;"Here's a bit about me- im 16, go to school and do high level basketball. I'm currently trying to improve my life in order to love myself more and to be proud of whom I am.

The problem- I'm trying to get better sleep. I lack sleep almost everyday which is incredibly frustrating. I know what the root of my problem is. It's that i don't do my homework and study enough. I always tend to tell myself, the nights when i dont have basketball practice, that i'll do my homework later. I always end up doing it late at night. The grades aren't the issue, I am a b+ student, although properly studying and sleeping could improve it. 
I should also mention that the nights where i do have lots of basketball, i could easily get to bed on time if i had done the homework on previous days.(its always given in advance)
Finally, i always want to get a head start on my homework on the weekend, but again i procrastinate.

What im looking for-
I'm looking for advice on how I could change my habits and start my homework immediately when I get back from school. I know, however, that when I start something I like to finish it. Maybe thats why i dont like to start things, i know how long it will take if i do it completely.

Secondly, i would appreciate any tips on how i could organize my time studying. I'd much prefer not doing it all the night before my tests. (And not sleeping enough) and i need to be able to do more work on the weekends and the nights i dont have practice to make the days when i do have practice easier to deal with.
 
Thanks for your time and any advice you might give!
";7;"Break it up into parts. Play videogames or watch YouTube, whatever for half an hour or an hour after getting home, then write a page or two for your homework. Then do 15-30 mins of fun, write another two pages. So on and so forth. 
  
Set timers (like pomodoro, or similar timers. For me the ones that have ""consequences"" to failing work the best for me - something as simple as concentrating for 30 minutes or a tree won't grow, is enough of a consequence for me). Make a timer for bedtime as well(keep in mind how long you want/need to sleep, and how long it usually takes you to go to sleep).

[Need advice] Need help changing my habits and start studying;t3_849wep;4;"Here's a bit about me- im 16, go to school and do high level basketball. I'm currently trying to improve my life in order to love myself more and to be proud of whom I am.

The problem- I'm trying to get better sleep. I lack sleep almost everyday which is incredibly frustrating. I know what the root of my problem is. It's that i don't do my homework and study enough. I always tend to tell myself, the nights when i dont have basketball practice, that i'll do my homework later. I always end up doing it late at night. The grades aren't the issue, I am a b+ student, although properly studying and sleeping could improve it. 
I should also mention that the nights where i do have lots of basketball, i could easily get to bed on time if i had done the homework on previous days.(its always given in advance)
Finally, i always want to get a head start on my homework on the weekend, but again i procrastinate.

What im looking for-
I'm looking for advice on how I could change my habits and start my homework immediately when I get back from school. I know, however, that when I start something I like to finish it. Maybe thats why i dont like to start things, i know how long it will take if i do it completely.

Secondly, i would appreciate any tips on how i could organize my time studying. I'd much prefer not doing it all the night before my tests. (And not sleeping enough) and i need to be able to do more work on the weekends and the nights i dont have practice to make the days when i do have practice easier to deal with.

Guaranteed success with that behavior.  Glad to hear it.

&gt;when I start something I like to finish it. Maybe thats why i dont like to start things, i know how long it will take if i do it completely.

I have this problem and for me it is over-kill head throb.  I gotta be perfect and in control and see it to the end.  I'm beginning to learn that showing up and just letting things be non-perfect is a better attitude to have. 

Tell yourself not to think about what is going to happen.  Keep it simple. Commit to *showing up*.  That's it.  Not actually studying, but showing up.  Then, commit to studying **only ten mintes**.  For real.  That part is discipline and you need to work on it. 

It's just as hard for me to discipline my mind away from obsessive control as it is to motivate myself to do things I don't like.  Work on this by understanding that your own ambition is killing you.  

Loving yourself means you trust yourself.  If you are a great student, then why worry about doing everything perfect?  Just trust yourself, don't worry about how much you need to do, but that you'll do the right thing.  

When you learn how to discipline your mind to keep yourself from stressing out, you'll sleep better too.

[NeedAdvice] How to increase stamina?;t3_83vctl;2;"Hello!

I've recently made some big changes in my life to get out of a very deep depression. Before, I would go to work, 90 minutes in traffic both ways, come home and just zone out to tv until I go to bed. I gained a ton of weight and was really unhappy and feeling stuck.

Now I've quit that job and moved to a small town where I walk everywhere and am going back to school part time. Every day I wake up at 6am, meditate, quick workout, shower, play with pets, then go to class. I work a part time remote job. I walk about 3-5 miles a day between running errands and classes. I eat healthy and drink a lot less alcohol. It's a good day. But every day at around 5 pm I just putter out and zone out to tv until bed at about 10. 

I'm really proud of the enormous progress I've made in the past 6 months, but looking forward I will start a full time graduate program in the fall. My days now are full but not busy, so its easy to calmly get everything done but I am still exhausted before the day is done. In the fall I will be taking twice the courses, and expect them to be much more difficult so will need to study a lot more as well.

How can I increase my stamina to prepare for  what I expect will be a much more busy, stressful lifestyle? How can I increase productivity while minimizing stress? Anyone have any tips or strategies?

Thanks for any help!";6;"I used to have this issue, after a long day at work or being productive in the mornings on the weekend, I just lose motivation to do anything at night. For me, it was a mental battle - consciously I knew I had to be productive but subconsciously, I wanted to slack off, watch Netflix, play video games etc. Every time I made a decision, there would be this clash and the part of me that wanted productivity won out. But through the day, it gets harder and harder to stay focused. 


I think what solved it for me was a few things. First, I started making a To Do list the night before that was a detailed plan of when I would work and relax. This removes a lot of the decision-making situations and I stopped feeling guilty about relaxation. Second, I created my schedule to balance mental and physical energy usage. I like to work on a project, do an errand, work some more, do another errand, etc. Finally, I started viewing the conscious part of mind as a muscle, the part that wants to be productive. And muscles can grow, I start putting more and more “productive” stuff in my schedule every month and reduce the relaxation time. 


Not sure if that helps – hope you figure it out. Great work on the progress and keep it up!

[Need advice] I realized my motivation is fueled by anxiety/panic and isn't sustainable.;t3_82yrt8;6;"(The back story may or may not be helpful but I'd like this conversation to help me find ways to motivate myself that aren't destructive and are sustainable instead. I want to go to medical school and if I continue to motivate with stress I don't think I can make it emotionally.)

Hi all, 
Here's a little bit about myself before I explain my situation:
I was unmotivated and apathetic in high school (had an abusive toxic family).  I graduated with a meh gpa and didn't think I'd get into college and didn't try. I started at a community college, and started to gain discipline and organizational techniques and despite starting to care I still didn't study much and got low B's and C's my first quarter. I kept trying and got straight A's my next. 

And despite the classes getting significantly harder, I maintained straight A's for 2 years. I was tutoring 20 hours a week, babysitting 10, taking a full courseload of time consuming chemistry/math courses and learned how to juggle it and keep myself accountable and focused. 

Then I transferred to the University of Washington Seattle. First quarter was a mess of anxiety, panic, feelings of inadequacy and competition. I hate competition. We have curved classes here which means it doesn't matter how well you do, if everyone gets A's, the low A's can end up with C's. I somehow managed to be in the top ten in ochem and got a 3.9 for the quarter. The only thing that had been driving me was fear of failure. I had to start seeing a therapist because I began having panic attacks in class. I picked up physical and mental healthier habits and have been a much happier person now.

But, I've burnt out. I can't follow through on any study plans. I don't care anymore. I've been getting C's on exams even though they're no harder than last quarter. I used to read all assigned readings but haven't read a single page of text this quarter. This is finals week and I've stalled studying for 4 days straight. 4 days.  My anxiety/mental state this quarter has gotten much better, but my therapist said it sounds like I've been succeeding for the past few years through fueling myself with anxiety. I can't agree more. Even before transferring to a competitive school, I thrived off of the thrill (stress) of having back to back meetings and responsibilities. My motivation stemmed from fire of fear under my butt, with occasional burn outs and break downs. How do I stay accountable and do what I don't feel like doing without my go-to catastrophic panic thinking? 

I realized I have never been able to just get up and do something unless I had triggered myself into panic over it first. Is that discipline at this point? How do you even go about motivating yourself in positive stress free ways? Thanks to anyone who reads this!

TL;DR I've gone from undisciplined to disciplined for the past few years but don't want to be stress-motivated anymore. I'm exhausted and burnt out. ";44;"You're panicking over failure from what I'm reading.

Find something to inspire yourself. Do you want to help make your community a better place? Make a significant discovery? Fix one of humanity's many problems?

Take me for instance. A few years back my goal was to own my own business. Now I want to become an AI scientist and pave the way for the future. That is what inspires me. A cause celebre will give you positive motivation and latent driving force to push you to get the next thing done.

My suggestion is to get the book/audiobook for ""The Now Habit"" and just start putting the basic principles into effect as soon as possible (guilt free play after work specifically). I had the same issue to a lesser extent, this book lays out principles and exact steps to use to stop stress based action, and allows you to get into the driver's seat of your actions. This really helped me start to lose the anxiety that comes with thinking about things to do, and replaced it with more constructive habits, that then allow me to actually do the tasks and feel good about it too.

I hope this is what you were looking for.

I started at a community college, and started to gain discipline and organizational techniques and despite starting to care I still didn't study much and got low B's and C's my first quarter. I kept trying and got straight A's my next. 

And despite the classes getting significantly harder, I maintained straight A's for 2 years. I was tutoring 20 hours a week, babysitting 10, taking a full courseload of time consuming chemistry/math courses and learned how to juggle it and keep myself accountable and focused. 

Then I transferred to the University of Washington Seattle. First quarter was a mess of anxiety, panic, feelings of inadequacy and competition. I hate competition. We have curved classes here which means it doesn't matter how well you do, if everyone gets A's, the low A's can end up with C's. I somehow managed to be in the top ten in ochem and got a 3.9 for the quarter. The only thing that had been driving me was fear of failure. I had to start seeing a therapist because I began having panic attacks in class. I picked up physical and mental healthier habits and have been a much happier person now.

But, I've burnt out. I can't follow through on any study plans. I don't care anymore. I've been getting C's on exams even though they're no harder than last quarter. I used to read all assigned readings but haven't read a single page of text this quarter. This is finals week and I've stalled studying for 4 days straight. 4 days.  My anxiety/mental state this quarter has gotten much better, but my therapist said it sounds like I've been succeeding for the past few years through fueling myself with anxiety. I can't agree more. Even before transferring to a competitive school, I thrived off of the thrill (stress) of having back to back meetings and responsibilities. My motivation stemmed from fire of fear under my butt, with occasional burn outs and break downs. How do I stay accountable and do what I don't feel like doing without my go-to catastrophic panic thinking? 

I realized I have never been able to just get up and do something unless I had triggered myself into panic over it first. Is that discipline at this point? How do you even go about motivating yourself in positive stress free ways? Thanks to anyone who reads this!

You can use other places as well - just make sure to tag them as study places. Which means you never ever introduce distractions in there. 

Keep your home for fun only - that’s fine. Allow yourself to be distracted there. And try, for a change, some higher intensity fun (watch a movie without reaching for your phone, for example. Play a video game while fully immersing yourself in it - headphones and all)

Like, are you playing video games &amp; watching TV, or are you distracted by incidental objects, like a mark on your textbook or the shape of your pencil eraser, then you need the bathroom, then a glass of water, and now you're petting your dog and uh, what were you doing? 

The solution to the first is to remove access to the things that are distracting you. Designate a separate work space, preferably at a desk or table, preferably NOT your bed. Create a routine/""ritual"" for getting started on your work, see if you can include some unique piece, like a special playlist or drink or snack you only have when doing homework.

For the second, you need to work on refocusing skills. And you should consider treatments and strategies for ADD. Plenty of people benefit from those techniques who don't have ADD, if you're trying to avoid the label.  

I'd like to add -- no one is going to tell your school if you get diagnosed with ADD without yours or your parents' permission. It's against the law to do so. A clinical diagnosis (by a doctor) and a disability identification (by school) are completely different, and one does not guarantee the other. Some students or their parents willingly divulge a clinical diagnosis in order to facilitate being identified as disabled, so the child can receive special services &amp; accommodations. Sometimes a school will initiate a disability identification evaluation on its own if it suspects a child of having a disability, but that's almost universally for primary school children; they're not going to bother with high school kids.  

And you can rest assured that no one is going tell colleges you're applying to. It is illegal for them to discriminate based on disability, so they don't even ask.

I am experimenting with a type of nag tool. Basically if I know I'm going to be doing something dumb that wastes my time and is bad for me in the long run, I turn on the nagger.

You can try the nagger here, just click play.

http://www.intervaltimer.com/timers/7894574-minder-30s-satou4

Every 30 seconds, it will beep. This is a real pain. The only rule is that you cannot turn off the nagger until you stop doing whatever and move away from the distraction. No turning off the nagger right before you stop. Nope, you have to turn the nagger off last. Otherwise you might trick yourself and go right back to the time wasting activity.

You can try other intervals too. I've made some with different times for convenience. I think the key is to find a balance: have enough time between beeps that you don't just start tuning it out, but also have them happen as close as possible so you get off as soon as you can.

[NeedAdvice] For the next 6 months I will have a lot of free time which I want to use for self improvement. I need your advice about how to do that.;t3_7ydt0q;18;"Hello r/getDisciplined,

Firstly, I should say that I am diagnosed with clinical depression and go to therapy for it, and I am trying really hard to fight the patterns of my depressed behaviour. That is what this post is about. A couple months ago my depression just got absolutely wild, so I decided to take the rest of the year off from my university studies to improve my life by changing my habits and becoming more disciplined. Now I have until September where I will only be working at my job and will have quite a bit of free time, but I am scared that I might just be wasting this great opportunity for improvement. It’s already been about 2 months since my break started, and I have only started brushing my teeth twice daily, journaling every evening, making my bed, taking cold showers and reading for at least five minutes a day, but I feel that this is not even close to what I feel I should be doing. Sure, that might look like it’s a lot, but all that stuff combined merely takes up about 10-20 minutes of my day total. I still spend 99% of my free time on Reddit just doing nothing, and what I am looking for is some ideas about what I should be doing with my free time to be in optimal shape to tackle the next school year as efficiently as possible. 

Firstly, I was thinking maybe I should get rid of or minimise my time spent on Reddit  and instead take up some sort of a hobby. I am really attracted to the idea of taking up something and gradually becoming better and better at it. I actually spend a bit of time every day playing my guitar but that’s usually up to an hour or so, so not that much time at all, thought the feeling of progress I feel by the end of the session is something I really love. Anyway, I am considering taking up blogging as I quite enjoy writing and think that it could be a fun way of getting my thoughts in tact. Reading more is something I also want to be doing more of, but have not yet gotten myself to doing that. I suppose if I take up lifting, reading more and blogging daily, that might be enough to fill most of my free time, but taking up so much at once sounds quite exhausting too, so maybe I should focus on baby steps instead and start with one thing at a time, which is probably less likely to fail but also sounds much less impressive or life changing.

I would love to lose some weight too but I don’t know how to do it successfully as I have tried a million times and failed just as many, so I’m not really confident in myself regarding that. I am currently reading Charles Duhigg’s ‘The Power of Habit’ and in the book there’s a thing called ‘Keystone Habits’, where certain habits ‘spill over’ to other parts of one’s life and not only the area where that habit is ‘supposed’ to help with. For example, daily exercise is one of those keystone habits, so maybe I should take up lifting every now and then or something among those lines. I play basketball about once a week but I don’t feel that’s enough to change my behavioral patterns, so maybe lifting is something I should consider taking up.

During the time off my studies I would also like to focus on improving my impulsive behaviour by strengthening my willpower, as I tend to buy a lot of junk food and binge on it without thinking and later regretting both wasting a lot of money and consuming so many calories. Currently I am trying to improve my willpower by ending my showers with turning on cold water for at least 5 seconds but again, I just don’t feel it’s enough for any significant change. To be completely honest, I have been stuck on this ‘5 second cold showers’ for two months at this point. On the other hand, maybe how I feel about all this is irrelevant and I should focus on just making my current habits slightly stronger, like maybe turning cold water for 10 or 15 seconds and increasing this interval steadily over time or something, I’m not sure anymore. 

After writing all that I see that maybe I am expecting a little too much from myself and should probably start by doing a plan of some sorts. For instance, maybe I should do a series of ‘30 day challenges’, where I focus on exercise for 30 days, then I focus on eating for 30 days and so on.

I am open to any suggestions, criticism, ideas or anything in between, please feel free to share your thoughts as even the smallest of inputs are very important and appreciated.

Thank you for your time.";333;"

**Let's start with your depression**
The key here is to develop habits that will boost the positive chemicals in your brain.

1.**Exercise** (You MUST start doing this daily - it can be any form you want.) A good one is strength training as this will activate the androgen receptors heavy in your shoulders and thighs. Do full body programs either with bodyweight exercises or at a gym. Less optimal choices (but still good) include : walking,running - only with good form, sports - could tie in with your new hobby, might I suggest a combat sport? Perhaps that's just my interest talking.

2.**Eating properly.**
Naturally this complements the first habit and helps in its own way. What you eat is what you are and people expect to be fine eating disgusting foods and then get surprised when they don't make ANY progress with exercise. I tell you this now there will be 0 progress made unless you eat properly. 

You don't have to be miracle worker here.
Cook your own food (lean meats for protein : chicken,eggs,pork should be a good staple. Naturally eating red meats will be a choice you make on your own.  Zero tolerance on processed rubbish like icecream (some will argue moderation but I feel it's just a way to keep participating in detrimental things) 

**Macros**
This is all you need in diet to achieve good results in exercise. Start a cut with -20% nutrients to start losing weight. Stick with it for a good 4-6 months or until you reach your desired weight (staying in a deficit is hard.)

**Building the discipline required for this.**
You have some elementary discipline already which is good, I've been building discipline for about 8 months now - so I can give you good things to do.

-Meditation

-NoFap

-Exeffect

-Cold Showers

These are good baseline habits that can give so much if done properly, I suggest you do all of them. 

**Trashy dopamine activities &amp; short term gratification**

Will probably be the hardest thing you do in improvement. Start reducing (I fully stopped but my Redditors need me!) the time you spend on YouTube,facebook,Reddit,Television and basically every junk activity you can think of. There are lots to cut out. Start replacing these with habits that I'll list down below in order of importance, the premise here is to cut out short term gratification (example : watching a tv show) for long term gratification (example : working out.)

This is what has helped me, some won't agree with nofap but I guarantee if you look into it - you will.

1.Exercise 
Benefits : basically every part of us enourmously- particular emphasis on raising testosterone levels and increasing longevity. 

2.Diet
Every failure in exercise results 90% of the time because of a poor diet. Not to mention it improves every part of us again (see how godly these habits are?)

3.Improve Sleep (essential)
Important in regulating hormones
Building muscle
Repairing certain brain cells and compressing memory 

4.Meditation
-Mindfulness in everything you do. Imagine being about to pick a cookie out of a jar and saying ""no that is unhealthy"", putting it away immediately and continuing on with your day. When you get into the subconscious programming even the act of grabbing that cookie will never happen.

5.NoFap 
-The largest snowball habit available.
Energy
Discipline 
Willpower 

6.Cold Showers
Discipline 
(And some strange health benefits)

7.Neural reprogramming (From the book : power of positive thinking) basically it means telling yourself specific phrases like ""I am productive"" throughout the day at key times to transfer it into your subconscious mind and - become it. The one in the book was ""If god is with us who is against us"" : Romans. Develop lots of faith,happiness and optimism. 

8.Reading non-fiction 
Back in my youth I used to read fiction books upwards of 6 hours a day after I got home from school. Escaping my parents terrible marriage arguments. What I learned was : all fiction reading offers is the ability to jump into a different world and escape life's problems. In a way it's no different to videogames,porn or drugs just on a much lower level.

9.Finding good friendships - helped me alot personally. People who share your values and goals - the ones who detract from your overall growth need to go. Boot them out OP.

**Your new hobby**
Once you remove the trash there will be so much extra time in your day. A full 24 hours where you can create anything you want - following dreams.

Start playing the guitar. 
Very good hobby.

Some additional ones could be:

Learning a new language 

Learning computer code (I'm into java)

Learning how to defend yourself 

Learning how to talk effectively

Learning financial strategies - investing

Anything with potential for real growth - just a few off the top of my head. At your age you might be more interested in sport also : join a club. 

""I am thinking of taking up blogging"" that sounds amazing! Structure your newfound self improvement and before you know it- most will be on autopilot. 

**Methods to implement change**
People are always divided but I'd like to mention this quickly. There are two ways to improve over time - you can do what I did in :

#1. Improving a bunch of stuff at the same time - shove it all in there. I'm serious go do it all at the same time, as humans we are capable of amazing things. Why this is large bolded - reddits crude editing system.

Positives - greater immediate change
(And I'm talking life saving change here)
Negatives - hard to maintain (took me upwards of 6 months)

#2 Gradual change over time
Positives - much more likely to be sustainable 
(Read a page a day for example.)
Negatives - zero to small amounts of change.

              
""I would like to improve my will power and stop the impulsive behaviour.""

Starting to eat healthy is going to help so much here. Not sure if you live alone but completely get rid of all junk food in the house OR ask parents to cater for some healthy food (maybe say you want to build muscle and need nutrient dense food.) Mindfulness I hear helps alot with impulsive behaviour - I used to be very impulsive going from a host of disgusting dopamine traps (From YouTube to Pornhub to unhealthy sugary food to gaming, really was rather vicious.)

As for willpower - it is constantly improving or declining. You can do certain things that will make it go up (example : cold showers &amp; nofap) and things that make it go down (example: use of weed/marijuana &amp; masturbation - to porn.)

**Losing weight**
I have the opposite problem!
Ectomorphic body structure sucks for males

Losing weight is just more output than input (eat less, workout more.) Just as gaining weight is (eat more, workout less -albeit gaining muscle is different would need to workout for breaking down muscle fibres.)

Of course there are always shortcuts, please be very careful with these as there is always potential to hurt yourself.

**Ketogenic diet**
Positives : extremely fast weight loss (Google success stories)
Sustained daily energy using ketones in the body for fuel

Negatives :
Going from using carbs as the primary fuel source to fats can be a dangerous transition.

**Water fast**
I haven't researched this too much - would recommend the juice fast more as there are carbohydrates included in the fast.

**Juice fast**
Carbs + water fast

**Food fast**
The human body can go 30 days without food - or so I've heard. Dependant on starting weight.
Might be dangerous? Research.

""I have been stuck on this 5 second cold shower challenge"" for me I had to go in 100% cold after my workouts 6 months ago. When you change from hot to warm to cold it is too tempting to keep it ""slightly warmer"" each time thus inhibiting results and dedication to cold showers.

The 30 day challenges don't work - been there, done that. Focus on stuff to stick to over a period of time - I think smaller things to implement will suit you better (start going through the listed habits and dulling them down for example : meditate for 5minutes and increase timing when you are ready.) Plan all of these habits with the exeffect which is basically a glorified task calender - do them every day until they become habits. Draw one yourself or find an app (I use 7 weeks on Android) -Pc has efficient calender free. IOS- I'm unsure because I don't use garbage phones. ;) 

Book to read (tonight):
The power of positive thinking
Read online,buy it or do the dodgy thing most of us do and download it free online. (Reddit post : how to download ebooks for idiots) highlights using the MIRC system to download books. I'm a big believer in free self help. 

YouTubers (watch Bartow and his video on purpose before deleting YouTube.)

Thank you for your time.";333;"The highest rated comment in here suggested a HUGE pile of crap for you to do. Know what's hard when you are depressed? Being confronted with a HUGE pile of crap do. You'll just say fuck it after the third day and that will be it.

I take a subtractive approach to my lifestyle: I work to remove things that I don't want to be doing, don't benefit me, aren't driving me towards my goals, and aren't really all that valuable to me.

If I were you, I'd start by getting my daily schedule straightened out so that I am waking up and going to bed at the same times every day, and eating at the same times every day without extra snacking and whatnot. Then I would add physical activity twice a day, once as soon after you wake up as you can, and once either before lunch or before dinner. Finally, I would evaluate my food choices and amounts for my meals.

After that, I'd work to get rid of every extra responsibility that I can. Get rid of every task that you don't find value in, and that doesn't drive you in the direction you want to be moving.

I am really attracted to the idea of taking up something and gradually becoming better and better at it. I actually spend a bit of time every day playing my guitar but that’s usually up to an hour or so, so not that much time at all, thought the feeling of progress I feel by the end of the session is something I really love. Anyway, I am considering taking up blogging as I quite enjoy writing and think that it could be a fun way of getting my thoughts in tact. Reading more is something I also want to be doing more of, but have not yet gotten myself to doing that. I suppose if I take up lifting, reading more and blogging daily, that might be enough to fill most of my free time, but taking up so much at once sounds quite exhausting too, so maybe I should focus on baby steps instead and start with one thing at a time, which is probably less likely to fail but also sounds much less impressive or life changing.

I would love to lose some weight too but I don’t know how to do it successfully as I have tried a million times and failed just as many, so I’m not really confident in myself regarding that. I am currently reading Charles Duhigg’s ‘The Power of Habit’ and in the book there’s a thing called ‘Keystone Habits’, where certain habits ‘spill over’ to other parts of one’s life and not only the area where that habit is ‘supposed’ to help with. For example, daily exercise is one of those keystone habits, so maybe I should take up lifting every now and then or something among those lines. I play basketball about once a week but I don’t feel that’s enough to change my behavioral patterns, so maybe lifting is something I should consider taking up.

During the time off my studies I would also like to focus on improving my impulsive behaviour by strengthening my willpower, as I tend to buy a lot of junk food and binge on it without thinking and later regretting both wasting a lot of money and consuming so many calories. Currently I am trying to improve my willpower by ending my showers with turning on cold water for at least 5 seconds but again, I just don’t feel it’s enough for any significant change. To be completely honest, I have been stuck on this ‘5 second cold showers’ for two months at this point. On the other hand, maybe how I feel about all this is irrelevant and I should focus on just making my current habits slightly stronger, like maybe turning cold water for 10 or 15 seconds and increasing this interval steadily over time or something, I’m not sure anymore. 

After writing all that I see that maybe I am expecting a little too much from myself and should probably start by doing a plan of some sorts. For instance, maybe I should do a series of ‘30 day challenges’, where I focus on exercise for 30 days, then I focus on eating for 30 days and so on.

I am open to any suggestions, criticism, ideas or anything in between, please feel free to share your thoughts as even the smallest of inputs are very important and appreciated.

Thank you for your time.";333;"You are doing amazingly well with your progress.

I think there is a temptation right now to just do everything and max yourself out. 

Please please remember that these small, tiny changes are exactly how you change your life. You can one-up your achievements by tiny increments and it's still progress. Going from a 5 second cold shower to a 6 second cold shower is still moving forward.

What I would recommend you think about is your default responses and how much they form your habits.

For example when you're hungry your default leads you to junk food, not because that's what you want but because it's a pre-decided default. Just planning and shopping for 1 healthy meal that becomes your new default can make an enormous impact.

You might think that you need a whole meal plan or a whole exercise plan but to start with you just need a go-to good option that you can always rely on without having to go through a decision making cycle.

You can do this with anything!

What's your default response to thirst, stress, tiredness?
Our default responses make up most of our actions.

If every time you find yourself thinking about really needing to exercise you do 1 immediate exercise right there - like a star jump, a squat or a push up, you are shortening the time between need &gt; action.

What is important is having a fast, friction free automatic response that adds a positive effect.

My defaults that I've changed over several years and many small steps.

* Thirst - went from picking Coke &gt; Water

* Food - went from Cheeseburger &gt; Chicken wrap

* Tiredness - went from fighting it trying to stay awake &gt; getting into bed and reading

* Stress - went from getting into bed in the day &gt; going to a 30 minute gym class

I only change 1 default at a time so there is no expectation to do all of this at once. Wait until your new habit becomes automatic before moving on to something else!";5;0.015015015015015015;[[0.98496146]];[[0.59426223]];0.9989;0.175;0.767;0.057999999999999996;0.9488;0.1;0.86;0.04;0.05699999999999999;0.10312386980108501;0.12679095098449938;-0.023667081183414387
[NeedAdvice] For the next 6 months I will have a lot of free time which I want to use for self improvement. I need your advice about how to do that.;t3_7ydt0q;18;"Hello r/getDisciplined,

Firstly, I should say that I am diagnosed with clinical depression and go to therapy for it, and I am trying really hard to fight the patterns of my depressed behaviour. That is what this post is about. A couple months ago my depression just got absolutely wild, so I decided to take the rest of the year off from my university studies to improve my life by changing my habits and becoming more disciplined. Now I have until September where I will only be working at my job and will have quite a bit of free time, but I am scared that I might just be wasting this great opportunity for improvement. It’s already been about 2 months since my break started, and I have only started brushing my teeth twice daily, journaling every evening, making my bed, taking cold showers and reading for at least five minutes a day, but I feel that this is not even close to what I feel I should be doing. Sure, that might look like it’s a lot, but all that stuff combined merely takes up about 10-20 minutes of my day total. I still spend 99% of my free time on Reddit just doing nothing, and what I am looking for is some ideas about what I should be doing with my free time to be in optimal shape to tackle the next school year as efficiently as possible.

Thank you for your time.";333;"I've very sorry to hear about your difficult struggle with depression, but I guarantee you things will get better — they always do, but it's hard to see that far in the future when you're facing immediate challenges. 

Unfortunately, change is a process and two months is very little time at all in the scheme of things. One thing people often fail to realize is that as people go through changes, it sometimes feels worse before you get better. Diet, for example: If you're used to eating snacks and high-calorie junk food, it takes a little bit of time and discipline, but ultimately your body starts to crave foods that are better for you. But it's the same with other things. It's easy to feel like you're lacking progress and not doing enough, but over time you will see the benefits and wonder what you were ever worried about.

The biggest thing that stands out to me here is that you don't have a lot of structure to your days. It will be tough if you can't build some of that into your days. What you choose to spend your time doing is up to you. Instead of looking at it as ""I have to do all these things with my time,"" you could also look at it as a gift — an opportunity to explore doing things you love.

A handful of things that have worked for me: An amazing therapist, an accountability partner and an incredible amount of support from my family and friends, daily meditation, daily journaling.

Therapy: There is a huge difference between a mediocre therapist and a great one. Since I am a creative person, I managed to find one who mostly works with creatives. My life has changed tremendously since I started working with him in June of last year. In addition to building my own business after I got laid off, I've also written a screenplay, a pilot script, half of another pilot script, a handful of essays (some that have gone viral), and part of a book. 

Accountability: If you can find someone as driven and motivated as you are, this can be a great motivator. My partner and I text each other frequently with updates and share a spreadsheet documenting our wins. We talk once a week about areas for improvement. It's worth noting that other areas in which others hold me accountable or have in the past are working out (there are some very cheap personal training options out there) and writing my screenplay (I have a weekly meeting with my writing partner — we actually often go to the gym first and then write for a few hours).

Support: Not everyone is lucky enough to have a great support network of family and friends. But the truth is, most of them want to help you. When I got laid off, I had two friends who asked if I wanted to work out of their offices/coworking spaces free of charge. Another friend asked me if I wanted to make a little bit of extra cash working for her a few days a week. Friends forward me freelance opportunities and offer mentorship. People in your life want to help you, but they often need to know what you need so they can. 

Meditation: This is daily practice now. 10 minutes using the app Oak, first thing in the morning and then sometimes again when I'm feeling stressed.

Writing: I journal three pages a day. This kickstarts my writing brain and gets me to focus.

It's worth noting that even though I don't have a set schedule like some people, I'm still working from 10-6 every weekday — throwing in a few extra hours on weekends. This discipline is very important, but I have to say that working out of an office has been very helpful.

One thing I'm hearing from you is that there are so many things you want to do that you end up not spending a lot of time with any of them. I have this problem, too, but you can alleviate it by focusing on just one or two things you want to work on for the next 30 days. I now have a ""must-do"" list and a ""backlog"" list — the ""must do"" is stuff that earns money or seems important for my longer goals (writing the screenplay, writing my fiction book) and letting some of the things on the backlog list go (answering certain emails, starting new projects). I figure I can move up the other stuff on the backlog list once the things on the main list are done.

Hope some of this helps, and good luck with your journey!";4;0.012012012012012012;[[0.9828001]];[[0.79778892]];0.9989;0.175;0.767;0.057999999999999996;0.9994;0.20800000000000002;0.752;0.04;-0.05099999999999999;0.10312386980108501;0.13284556224773614;-0.02972169244665117

I suppose if I take up lifting, reading more and blogging daily, that might be enough to fill most of my free time, but taking up so much at once sounds quite exhausting too, so maybe I should focus on baby steps instead and start with one thing at a time, which is probably less likely to fail but also sounds much less impressive or life changing.

I would love to lose some weight too but I don’t know how to do it successfully as I have tried a million times and failed just as many, so I’m not really confident in myself regarding that. I am currently reading Charles Duhigg’s ‘The Power of Habit’ and in the book there’s a thing called ‘Keystone Habits’, where certain habits ‘spill over’ to other parts of one’s life and not only the area where that habit is ‘supposed’ to help with. For example, daily exercise is one of those keystone habits, so maybe I should take up lifting every now and then or something among those lines. I play basketball about once a week but I don’t feel that’s enough to change my behavioral patterns, so maybe lifting is something I should consider taking up.

During the time off my studies I would also like to focus on improving my impulsive behaviour by strengthening my willpower, as I tend to buy a lot of junk food and binge on it without thinking and later regretting both wasting a lot of money and consuming so many calories. Currently I am trying to improve my willpower by ending my showers with turning on cold water for at least 5 seconds but again, I just don’t feel it’s enough for any significant change. To be completely honest, I have been stuck on this ‘5 second cold showers’ for two months at this point. On the other hand, maybe how I feel about all this is irrelevant and I should focus on just making my current habits slightly stronger, like maybe turning cold water for 10 or 15 seconds and increasing this interval steadily over time or something, I’m not sure anymore. 

After writing all that I see that maybe I am expecting a little too much from myself and should probably start by doing a plan of some sorts. For instance, maybe I should do a series of ‘30 day challenges’, where I focus on exercise for 30 days, then I focus on eating for 30 days and so on.

I am open to any suggestions, criticism, ideas or anything in between, please feel free to share your thoughts as even the smallest of inputs are very important and appreciated.

Thank you for your time.";333;"Okay. I won't give you one of those MASSIVE comments like some others did. But since you like playing guitar and try to find a new hobby, here two suggestions: Build your own guitar. If you don't have access to big tools, there are kits out there and they don't need to be boring, they can turn out lovely. Other suggestion: build your own guitar stompboxes if you are slightly interested in electronics.

I personally found that the best hobbies to overcome depression are those where you actively build something and can physically see the progress.

[NeedAdvice] For the next 6 months I will have a lot of free time which I want to use for self improvement. I need your advice about how to do that.;t3_7ydt0q;18;"Hello r/getDisciplined,

Firstly, I should say that I am diagnosed with clinical depression and go to therapy for it, and I am trying really hard to fight the patterns of my depressed behaviour. That is what this post is about. A couple months ago my depression just got absolutely wild, so I decided to take the rest of the year off from my university studies to improve my life by changing my habits and becoming more disciplined. Now I have until September where I will only be working at my job and will have quite a bit of free time, but I am scared that I might just be wasting this great opportunity for improvement. It’s already been about 2 months since my break started, and I have only started brushing my teeth twice daily, journaling every evening, making my bed, taking cold showers and reading for at least five minutes a day, but I feel that this is not even close to what I feel I should be doing. Sure, that might look like it’s a lot, but all that stuff combined merely takes up about 10-20 minutes of my day total. I still spend 99% of my free time on Reddit just doing nothing, and what I am looking for is some ideas about what I should be doing with my free time to be in optimal shape to tackle the next school year as efficiently as possible. 

Firstly, I was thinking maybe I should get rid of or minimise my time spent on Reddit  and instead take up some sort of a hobby. I am really attracted to the idea of taking up something and gradually becoming better and better at it. I actually spend a bit of time every day playing my guitar but that’s usually up to an hour or so, so not that much time at all, thought the feeling of progress I feel by the end of the session is something I really love.

For example, daily exercise is one of those keystone habits, so maybe I should take up lifting every now and then or something among those lines. I play basketball about once a week but I don’t feel that’s enough to change my behavioral patterns, so maybe lifting is something I should consider taking up.

During the time off my studies I would also like to focus on improving my impulsive behaviour by strengthening my willpower, as I tend to buy a lot of junk food and binge on it without thinking and later regretting both wasting a lot of money and consuming so many calories.

To be completely honest, I have been stuck on this ‘5 second cold showers’ for two months at this point. On the other hand, maybe how I feel about all this is irrelevant and I should focus on just making my current habits slightly stronger, like maybe turning cold water for 10 or 15 seconds and increasing this interval steadily over time or something, I’m not sure anymore.

So instead of running in town or on a treadmill, I hike or trail run. Instead of lifting weights, I joined a climbing gym. If you're near a ski hill, skiing/snowboarding is a great source of cardio as well as a decent leg workout. 

I would also personally recommend beginning a meditation routine. ";1;0.003003003003003003;[[0.93536057]];[[0.43478965]];0.9989;0.175;0.767;0.057999999999999996;0.9686;0.265;0.735;0.0;-0.14800000000000002;0.10312386980108501;0.2375;-0.13437613019891506
[NeedAdvice] For the next 6 months I will have a lot of free time which I want to use for self improvement. I need your advice about how to do that.;t3_7ydt0q;18;"Hello r/getDisciplined,

Firstly, I should say that I am diagnosed with clinical depression and go to therapy for it, and I am trying really hard to fight the patterns of my depressed behaviour. That is what this post is about. A couple months ago my depression just got absolutely wild, so I decided to take the rest of the year off from my university studies to improve my life by changing my habits and becoming more disciplined. Now I have until September where I will only be working at my job and will have quite a bit of free time, but I am scared that I might just be wasting this great opportunity for improvement. It’s already been about 2 months since my break started, and I have only started brushing my teeth twice daily, journaling every evening, making my bed, taking cold showers and reading for at least five minutes a day, but I feel that this is not even close to what I feel I should be doing. Sure, that might look like it’s a lot, but all that stuff combined merely takes up about 10-20 minutes of my day total. I still spend 99% of my free time on Reddit just doing nothing, and what I am looking for is some ideas about what I should be doing with my free time to be in optimal shape to tackle the next school year as efficiently as possible. 

Firstly, I was thinking maybe I should get rid of or minimise my time spent on Reddit  and instead take up some sort of a hobby. I am really attracted to the idea of taking up something and gradually becoming better and better at it. I actually spend a bit of time every day playing my guitar but that’s usually up to an hour or so, so not that much time at all, thought the feeling of progress I feel by the end of the session is something I really love. Anyway, I am considering taking up blogging as I quite enjoy writing and think that it could be a fun way of getting my thoughts in tact. Reading more is something I also want to be doing more of, but have not yet gotten myself to doing that. I suppose if I take up lifting, reading more and blogging daily, that might be enough to fill most of my free time, but taking up so much at once sounds quite exhausting too, so maybe I should focus on baby steps instead and start with one thing at a time, which is probably less likely to fail but also sounds much less impressive or life changing.

Thank you for your time.";333;"The no. One thing I would do was to read ahead. No really. Do it intensely so you dont lose rythm. I had two hours every afternoon/evening: 30 min transport and changig to/from the gym. 1 hour class yoga. My gym chain requires to sign in at the door at least 15 minutes before class start. I booked classes a week to three in advance. Weekend classes would be longer and focus on technique=super valuable. Always filled between 1-2 weeks before. With 20 on waiting list.
I also had: an android phone. Simple: I had deleted or cleared most apps. Set myfitnesspal as widget on front page. Take time to log weight every day (to get a weekly average) in the morning. Also as often as possible log foods. If you mealprep you can reenter old meals. 
The third thing I had was my own yoga mat and clothes. It made me so much more comitted: I had lugged this 4kg mat through the bus and on walks to the gym. No way I was going to flake. 
4th thing: Focus and sovereignty. I dropped some grades but that was okay. Just temporary. I never smalltalked with anyone at the gym, I worked out alone. This kept me focused and avoidant of social politics “hi suzie how are you” bullshit. I lost 10 kg in a year. I read the sidebar in r fitness loseit and mealprep.

Yoga is amazing if you want to incorporate mindfulness and exercise into your daily routine! The 30 day challenges are a great way to form a habit out of it especially because it takes away the stress of having to decide how you’re going to work out and what you’re going to do that day.

";1;"It also sounds like maybe you might not be getting the very best advice from this particular teacher. Diversify your inputs.

Go ask other violinists, or better yet, ask around and see who the best violinist is, be it another student or another teacher and ask them if you could get their input on what you can do to improve your game, get criticism - and insights on what you can do better. 

Sometimes, you do well all around, other times, you find a particularly tricky piece and if others point it out you know it, they know it and you're on the right track towards tackling your problems.

Other times, it's an out of the blue ""insult"" where some piece or technique you think you have nailed down, turns out to be weaker to someone else's ear. THIS is the golden nugget - because now you have a possibility, that they have brought something to your attention that you didn't realize was a problem. Perhaps you grudgingly agree, and perhaps you don't but at least now you know that someone else feels your X could be better than it is. 

It's ridiculously good for your skills but not necessarily your ego. 

As far as discipline is concerned , perhaps your practice needs time investment, fiddling away at some particularly difficult arpeggios or other aspects of play until you feel confident, might be just what you need. 

It's not hard to find something [stupid hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvrTmzzGwu8) that basically can be made to [intimidate](https://soundcloud.com/riff_music_pony/technical-difficulties) everyone.

I've been unemployed for half a year now. I'm just way too comfortable living at home to do anything about my situation. My parents don't want me to leave and treat me like a house pet. I don't know what to do at this point. I feel stuck. ;283;"If you want a change, you are the only one that can do it.  Step 1: stop calling yourself a loser.  What you allow yourself to think is what you become.  Forgive yourself for the past and move on.  You are capable of great things.  Step2: look for a job...right now.  Even if it’s flipping burgers, it’s better than doing nothing.  Start getting out there, and since you are living at home, put at least 50% of your earnings into savings.  Show up to work on time and with the right attitude.  Make your best effort at work every day .  Someone you meet doing this job could be the key to a future job!  Step 3: what are you passionate about? If college isn’t for you, that is perfectly fine.  There are many trade schools that are looking for manpower and you can earn a great living without a college degree.  You don’t want to flip burgers forever, so every day you need to be taking the steps needed to start your career.   Step 4: stop letting your mom and dad do stuff for you.  If you start acting like an adult, hopefully your mom and dad will treat you like one.  Do your own laundry, clean your own room, make your own meals or take a turn preparing dinner.

Take action ASA-fuckin-P. Im 40, living your life and I know more than a dozen people that do, personally.  You have to start living life, create new routines, get a job and eventually a career.   If you hesitate you will become complacent and be another one of the people watching others live life.  The most important thing I've learned from reddit and threads like this one is that its easier to start something new than to stop something you already do. If you start going to work, getting an education, do some chores around the house, you won't have time to be lazy and useless and won't let your parents pamper you.

Find work. Do the hard/ unpleasant parts of life yourself: pay bills, wash stuff, organize things. Don’t rely on others. It’s the only way you’ll understand the shared experience of adulting. And the only way to get better at something is to practice. 

Don’t take the advice above to travel. Yes, you’ll learn life skills.  But you need job experience more than you need a vacation right now.

Can you try to give yourself a date to move out? It always surprises me what I'm capable of when I'm faced with a deadline. Even if you just start with getting a job, accomplishing something productive will do wonders for your self esteem and sense of accomplishment.

You're not a loser, you just haven't discovered what you're capable of yet. The more you trash talk yourself the less likely you'll be to achieve your goals. If you continue to think about what a garbage person you are, the more depressed you'll become and the harder it will be to achieve your goals. When I started to try to get away from those thoughts, I felt guilty because I felt like I deserved to feel like shit. What helped with that was realizing that it doesn't fucking matter if it's true wether or not I'm a failure, either way thinking about how much of a failure I am isn't helpful.

I don't know what to do at this point. I feel stuck. ;283;"Hi, this is me nine years ago. (Still me, now, actually - I studied and worked hard in my late teens but quit job, sunk into depression and stayed home at age 22, still here) 

If I could turn back time and be 22 again (I would give anything to be at your current age), I would have just upped and left - buy an air ticket, move as far away from home as possible, TRAVEL TRAVEL TRAVEL, get a job (even if minimal wage, if that comes with room and board) and then start from there (once you're away, you might get a better sense of what you want to do with your life).

(Of course that's what I would do - you may want to approach this differently. Like another poster said - start small, do your chores, fix your own meal, build a life outside of the house maybe volunteer etc) 

Right now it's far difficult for me to do any of the above - at age 31 with a kid I can't do the up and leave. I have a huge gap in my resume so I could probably get a minimal wage job if I want to work (but will be working for free after cheap, possibly abusive childcare services etc, if not at a loss). I did some web design job but nothing substantial and have no real job skills - if my parents drop dead tomorrow (they are aging) I'm dangerously close to living on the street. I do my best to change (in a start-stop pattern nonetheless), but being used to this 'house pet' lifestyle for the past ten years I realize change can come difficult because of momentum - hence I suggest you to make a change now, instead of further down the road.

Your parents don't want you to leave - but they aren't going to be around forever to support you financially (unless you're a trust fund baby then I rest my case) I agree with poster above - stop calling yourself a loser (I used to call myself a slacker - guess what? I only do things that fit this label) You're still young - take me as a 'cautionary tale'. You do not want to stay stuck for the next ten years. 

Good luck and all the best!";2;0.007067137809187279;[[0.9636742]];[[0.53154991]];0.8845;0.188;0.752;0.06;0.8340000000000001;0.132;0.754;0.113;0.109;0.17083333333333334;0.06435346496322106;0.10647986837011228

You have to start building something for yourself now. 
You can take what you have as a blessing, use the gift that your parents don't mind you home without bills to pay to start finding your niche! Start carpentry, art, anything that you like, get good at it, try and make a living of it. You can start small, Learn new languages while at home! It's a great leg up in any potential future career! 

From another view, think of all the potential sex you could be having if you were a man with goals and ambitions and actually working on them! 
If you're still living off your parents and doing nothing with yourself as years go by you'll be less and less attractive and interesting  to future potential lovers. 

Want a lover? Earn them. Want a dog? Earn it. Want to travel? Earn it!!!

Be the man who can take care of himself. Be the man who taught himself amazing things.

When you're at home it's very easy for your friends to message you or come over and ask you to go out. And it's even easier to just relax and play video games.

[Need Advice] [Method] When it comes to reading assignments for my classes, I find it absolutely dreadful and not able to retain the information.;t3_800meh;3;"I put the reading off and then I’m left with *soo* much reading. I become overwhelmed and then do it in a hurried manner, thus not retaining the information. 

Do you guys have any tips on how to read material that is not stimulating to you at all? I have some ideas in my head but I wanted to see what others do and try those methods out. 

Thanks!";6;"You should first scan the material to get the gist of whatever it is that you're reading. Next, read through the material without taking any notes. Just try to understand what you're reading. Once you've done all that, go through the material once more to take notes. Only write down the big concepts of each section and really try to understand what the material is saying overall and how the concepts fit together. (This is the most important part!)

If you do all this and actually take good notes, you shouldn't need to read the material again. It is impossible to remember everything you read, so don't read the material thinking that you have to retain every little fact. You will stress yourself out (and wind up putting off the reading like you're doing right now). 


Now here is another extremely important part. It's not *reading* the material that matters. It's *reviewing* the material, *repeatedly*, after you've read it. This is why you should get your reading done early, so you have the proper time to review it. Repetition is the best (and probably only way) to remember material. It's how you store it in your long-term memory. Reading the material once only stores the facts in your short-term memory, which will soon be forgotten—this is most likely the exact issue you're dealing with.  


When you're reviewing, it's best to practice a certain type of repetition called spaced repetition. Review the material for a few days in a row once you've made your notes. Then, skip a day or two before reviewing your notes again. You actually want to let yourself ""forget"" the material. Then, when you try to recall it and struggle to remember, this will help store it in your long-term memory. This method works even if you remember the material wrong! Once you look at the correct answer, your mind is going to remember that information and not whatever wrong thing you first thought of. After this step, wait even longer to review your material, like an entire week. Then maybe do two weeks. (Obviously this time frame for reviewing your notes is going to depend on how long you have until an exam and how well you are able to recall the material. If you can't improve your recall by studying only a few days apart, don't try to do two weeks apart.) 

Another important part of reviewing material is to *never* look at it when you're trying to recall the information. If you avoid looking, this will show you whether you truly remember the information or not, and you can pinpoint the gaps in your knowledge you need to fix. What happens when you look at your notes when you study is called something like false understanding (I forget the exact term). It gives you the false impression that you know/remember facts that you don't actually remember. Then you perform poorly on the exam since you were overly confident in your nonexistent knowledge base. 


So to sum this up. Read your material early. Take notes on the broad concepts (and any other facts your teacher specifically wants you to remember). Understand exactly how these concepts fit together and why they're important. (You should be able to verbally explain these ideas to another person or you don't know the material well enough.) Once you have your notes, review them repeatedly. When doing so, review your notes further and further apart. Use active recall when you review instead of just reading your notes. In the few days before your exam, you can review every day and even flip through the reading material again to refresh your mind. After doing all of this, take your exam and kick its ass! Because there's no need to stress out and put off your work. :)
