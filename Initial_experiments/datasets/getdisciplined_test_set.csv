[NeedAdvice] How to say “no” to peer-pressure and not feel bad about it.;t3_88amr2;3;"Last night I was out with some friends. It was a good night except that one of the things I am trying to eliminate from my life is alcohol and as you can probably guess, alcohol was abundant. One of my friends was trying to convince me to take a shot but when I said no she was persistent to the point where I felt like I was disappointing her. Regardless of this I managed to stick to my commitment to myself and didn’t drink at all last night but still felt somewhat bad for refusing to join in.

Tonight, a similar thing happened. I was invited out again but this time I said I couldn’t make it because I had things on tomorrow morning (I am trying to build the habit of getting up early). Instead of accepting that I wasn’t going I was bombarded with messages insisting I should come out. Again, I managed to hold strong and stick to my no but just like last night I feel that I am letting down people by not showing up.

In summary, I manage to say no to things that would be counter to the habits I am trying to form but as a result I have conflicting feelings. On one hand, I am proud of myself for making decisions that will lead to self improvement, but on the other hand, I am feeling that I am letting down my friends by not joining in on their idea of a good night(s)";2;"Believe it or not, you will help out your friends in the long run by setting a “no to alcohol” example.

"[Need advice] &amp; [Discussion] Do you derive happiness from being disciplined?";t3_84l7sr;6;"Hey All,

I'm a mid 20s dude that's pretty unhappy with his life trying to find a way to change that. I like to ground discussions in self reflection, so I'll start with little about me (if you're curious): 



**Me:**

Mid 20s, graduated college but have since lived with my parents, been working a nearly minimum wage job since leaving college, am a little over weight (probably like 20-25 pounds, thankfully not enormous). 

My life isn't terrible and I'm not trying to claim everything's bad. At the risk of sounding like I post in /r/iamverysmart, I think I'm a pretty capable individual that can learn to do anything and I do have some goals in life; my ultimate goal is to go to medical school and think I'm pretty close (applied this year and got rejected by nearly everywhere, but I think I was a competitive applicant). 

However, I've found myself chronically unhappy for the last few years and I think it's because I have no discipline. These days I feel like I'm addicted to screens, flipping from computer to phone to TV nearly all day. My sleep schedule is horrible and I feel like I'm always tired. I can never seem to consistently stick with any exercise or diet plan and often find my self taking multiple ""rest days"" and just generally eating like shit. I've never had a girlfriend (or even sex) and masturbate at least daily (despite multiple efforts to stop- idk if I can even call these efforts honestly).


When I think back to when I was happiest in life it was probably a brief ~3 month period where I was (comparatively) incredibly disciplined. I used the self control app to block all distractions and actually got school work done en route to the best term of my academic career, I ran nearly every day preparing for a half-marathon, masturbated significantly less, and just felt so much better in my life. 

&amp;nbsp;

**And now, my questions:**

All these things were much tougher than things I do now, but it seems like they made me a happier person (easier ≠happier, go figure). That person seems like a distant memory now. How can I get back to doing them?

 Is disciple the bedrock I need to live a happy life? Will I be happy if I can get back to these things or will I just look for other things that are wrong with my life?

Basically it’s a means to an end. Basically you get all the boring stuff out of the way so you have more time to do fun things. Yes you have to do laundry and clean your room, but if you get that done in 3 hours instead of 6, you have time to do what you consider fun. You can go out and talk to girls (just say fuck it and talk to them. The less you care the easier it is, ironically. Worst thing, she says no and you move on), play video games, read, whatever floats your boat. Also from what I hear led school is super competitive, so if you didn’t cure cancer as an undergrad, it won’t be easy, but you’ll get into one eventually. 

Regarding jerking off, fill your time with real activities. Hang out with friends, travel, go to the gym, play sports etc. you’ll be so busy having fun that you won’t even notice that you haven’t done it in a few days. 

Lastly, there are a lot of intelligent people who aren’t “disciplined” and they’re seen as underachievers. If you’re smart, then that means you have something that a lot of people don’t have, so imagine how much better you’d be if you worked hard!";4;0.3076923076923077;[[0.97815415]];[[0.52882347]];0.9878;0.172;0.722;0.106;0.9862;0.19899999999999998;0.721;0.08;-0.05300000000000002;0.008292011019283741;0.06401942355889723;-0.05572741253961348

I hate it. I hate doing things that I don't want to do. No matter how disciplined I become, it seems that doesn't change. However the side effects of discipline do make me happier, which is why I stay at it. I would be perfectly content lazing all day, eating whatever I wanted and doing whatever I wanted, but I'd be a broke, unhealthy, sleep deprived chronic masterbater who just did the same stuff every day with no variety and no physical well being or psychological happiness to match the instinctual contentedness that I had achieved. I do allow this part of myself regular indulgence, mainly so that he'll stop whining and complaining, but only in exchange for achieving my goals. I recently quit eating mayo, which was my junk food, caloric kryptonite. I just completely stopped. This may sound silly to most but I was totally addicted to the stuff. Even now whenever I get hungry, I'm imagining eating something with mayo, and so food for the last couple of weeks has been very unsatisfying. I feel like I'm eating dirt half the time. So in exchange, so that my inner voice that's pissed off that I'm depriving myself of this calorie dense delicacy (I started eating mayo as a kid when I was poor and calorie deprived) I'm just allowing myself to eat whatever else I want. But hey! Not so fast. Whatever I want within a specific calorie allowance and while intermittent fasting. So basically what I'm blathering on about is that you have to strike a balance between the part of yourself that wants discipline and the part that doesn't. Otherwise the experience will suck for both parts, and for your self as a whole. ;3;0.23076923076923075;[[0.97759063]];[[0.677833]];0.9878;0.172;0.722;0.106;-0.9896;0.07200000000000001;0.735;0.193;0.187;0.008292011019283741;-0.007407407407407419;0.015699418426691158

Do all you people out there that live disciplined lives actually feel happier, or is unhappiness just a human default as we're always in search of more?";13;"Happiness only comes when you define what that is for you. You can choose to be happy now. It’s all how you look at things. How do you define happiness? Is it a certain number in your bank account? A number on the scale? A number on your Reddit inbox?

Or can happiness be waking up in the morning and having another day? I found three things that helped me to be happy:

1. Define it. I defined what happiness means for me. All it is for me is as long as I keep waking up in the morning and then stay present during the day (focusing on now instead of regretting the past or worrying about the future. I like the saying that depression is preoccupation with the last and anxiety is preoccupation with the future whereas happiness is being focused on the now) then I’m happy!

2. Buy a 5 minute journal (or just use a notebook) and write down 3 things you’re grateful for every night before bed. After about a week you’ll run out of easy stuff (like air conditioning and readily available food and your health and the Internet) and you’ll have to start really looking around and you’ll realize that you have SO MUCH to be grateful for. 

3. The idea that happiness is not something that you attain, it’s skmething that is already there, you just have to accept it. It’s basically changing your point of view so that no matter what events are happening outside of your mind, YOU are the one who determines how to feel about it. Imagine this. You have pain in your shoulder. Is that good or bad? Well, if you’ve been to see a doctor and he said “oh my, this might be cancer, you’re gonna want to see a specialist” then you’re gonna be thinking “oh my god, this pain is horrible and terrifying!”  But what if your shoulder hurts because you have been pumping some iron. You’ll be like “oooooh yeah that shit hurts so good. Im a beast!”  It’s the same exact pain but depending on how you look at it you’re either “happy” or “sad”

Another story. A guy wins a free car in a twitter contest. All his friends say “oh man you’re so lucky!” He says “maybe”. Then he gets in a car crash and nearly dies and he’s in the hospital and his friends are like “oh man, so unlucky that you got that car” and he’s like “maybe”. But then in the hospital he meets a woman who becomes his wife and they’re like “oh you’re so lucky you went to the hospital!” And he’s like “maybe”. But then he gets an infection from the hospital and it’s impossibke to cure and they’re like “oh that’s so unlucky!”  

You see, THINGS are always going to happen. You have no control over that. The one thing you do have control over is how to perceive them. 

Buy the book “the obstacle is the way” and read it. It’s by ryan holiday. It’s the book I base my life on. It is literally the operating system of my brain. There is not a single thing that can happen to me that I would think “oh man this sucks”. Because I know that there is something good that can come out of ANYTHING. 

I’m so grateful that I was a crazy college kid and got drunk and high and crashed my car and got arrested. It led me to being forced to abstain from drugs and alcohol for a year so all I could do was study in school and I realized how much I loved a particular field of study and so I changed major and went to a new school 

I’m so grateful that while at that new school I dabbled again in heavy drinking and got into more trouble which made me totally reevaluate my life and what I wanted to do with it which led me to move across the country and pursue a new career.

I’m so glad I am totally addicted to drugs and alcohol because it made me realize how bad that shit is in my life and led me to being sober and energized as fuck. 

Every “bad” thing has something good. A learning experience. A chance to test your mettle. An opportunity to grow. 

Traffic gives you a chance to look around and observe the birds flying around. 

A power outage let’s you reconnect with what life was like on earth for billions of years up until a hundred years ago. 

A cancer diagnosis allows you to focus on what truly matters in life and stop wasting your fucking precious time doing shit you I don’t want to do. 

And discipline is how you do these things. ";3;0.23076923076923075;[[0.9819522]];[[0.74589271]];0.9878;0.172;0.722;0.106;0.9942;0.161;0.743;0.096;0.000999999999999987;0.008292011019283741;0.11800811141720235;-0.10971610039791864

I used the self control app to block all distractions and actually got school work done en route to the best term of my academic career, I ran nearly every day preparing for a half-marathon, masturbated significantly less, and just felt so much better in my life. 

&amp;nbsp;

**And now, my questions:**

All these things were much tougher than things I do now, but it seems like they made me a happier person (easier ≠happier, go figure). That person seems like a distant memory now. How can I get back to doing them?

 Is disciple the bedrock I need to live a happy life? Will I be happy if I can get back to these things or will I just look for other things that are wrong with my life? Do all you people out there that live disciplined lives actually feel happier, or is unhappiness just a human default as we're always in search of more?";13;For me, being disciplined makes me happy.

Some people just naturally procrastinate until the last minute. 
Here's some tips on getting focused:
1. Remove the distractions - Put on website blockers, turn off your phone etc.
2. Find a productive place - when I was studying I could never do so that effectively from home. But when I went to the local library I could study for hours on end without distraction
3. Write a list of mini goals, and reward yourself when you hit each milestone without distraction
4. Stay hydrated, and eat nutritious food - Junk food and dehydration has a tendency to make you lose focus more easily
5. Get adequate sleep, and study when it fits your natural rhythm - I could never study at 8 in the morning, but 2am, no problem! Find out what works for you!
6. Exercise - exercise has numerous benefits including refreshing an otherwise stressed and tired brain
7. Use music - I know a bunch of people, myself included, who can play one song on repeat for hours on end, which can help focus";2;0.5;[[0.94200049]];[[0.56284788]];0.4867;0.065;0.935;0.0;0.6655;0.134;0.778;0.08900000000000001;0.01999999999999999;0.2059523809523809;0.2185763888888889;-0.012624007936508004

It was small stuff at first, a lipstick, a chocolate bar, a bracelet.

I started getting all my friends in on it and once a week my best friend and i would go to the mall after school steal a bunch of stuff and go home. 

It became a huge problem, even though i had a job, i had money, my parents were giving me money also, i just HAD to steal it. I got a nice rush out of it and my friends would ""look up to me"" because of how good I'd gotten at it.

I don’t think it’s as easy as saying ‘I want to stop’ because if it was, you wouldn’t have started up again so soon after being caught. Sometimes speaking to a professional is the best option - they will be able to help you work through this, and come up with some solutions to help you curb this. This might mean having a serious ‘coming clean’ chat with your parents about the extent of the problem, but being open and honest with them will be a really important first step if you are serious about stopping.

I don't even feel bad when i do it, i feel a nice rush? I dont know why i do it. I watched some dr phil and ive seen movies and people find some psychological reasoning for why they steal.

I remember the cop that arrested me told my parents ""this is a cry for attention"" 

this is not a cry for attention, the last thing i want is attention.

I need ways on how to stop, i dont want to go see a therapist. I don't need money because i have that as well. What is the reasoning for me doing this? how can i stop? ";122;"No one WANTS to see a therapist, you don't do it because it's fun. You do it because it will help you stop stealing.

(I realise this post is kind of exactly about not being able to resist only doing what's fun, but).

Like ""I broke my leg, but I don't want to go to hospital because they're gross and depressing"". Yeah they are gross and depressing but your leg is broken so you gotta go.

(Don't know if it helps but the reason I stopped is because I really want to travel internationationally, which you can't do if you have a proper criminal record. A one-off shoplifting charge is okay, but more than that and you will really find it hard to get visas etc)";47;0.38524590163934425;[[0.96354004]];[[0.45782851]];-0.9764;0.115;0.741;0.14400000000000002;-0.9482;0.109;0.665;0.226;0.08800000000000002;0.15737179487179487;0.06622807017543858;0.0911437246963563
[NeedAdvice] how do i stop stealing;t3_88tsd4;41;"So just off the bat, I have a shoplifting problem.

I remember the first time i stole was like candy bars at the dollar store when i was 8 or 9. 

I remember being in the 4th grade and i stole a SHIT TON of make up from some fancy department store. 

A few days later i was at the flea market and my mom caught me stealing a nail polish. 

This started again when i was in the 9th grade. 

It was small stuff at first, a lipstick, a chocolate bar, a bracelet.

Then it went to me stealing hundreds of dollars worth of make up from sephora.

I started stealing clothes, i figured out a way to get rid of the security tag and i was very slick with it too.

From the 9th grade to the 12th grade i had stolen maybe a good $10,000 worth of stuff and hadn't gotten caught (yet)

I started getting all my friends in on it and once a week my best friend and i would go to the mall after school steal a bunch of stuff and go home. 

It became a huge problem, even though i had a job, i had money, my parents were giving me money also, i just HAD to steal it. I got a nice rush out of it and my friends would ""look up to me"" because of how good I'd gotten at it. 

I started stealing money from my parents (mind you, they were still giving me an allowance anyway), from my friends, any time i saw something i liked, i took it!

Long story short, a year and a half ago, my friend and i had gone to the mall for our weekly shoplifting spree and we were headed out but she wanted to grab a lipstick so we went inside this store she got a lipstick as we walked out, a security guard stopped us.

He took us into the back, saw that we stole a bunch of stuff and called the cops. 

My friend and i both got arrested and charged (luckily we were 17 so the charges were dropped when we turned 18)

Did that stop me from stealing? nope.

";122;"-One way to do it would be to put yourself in the shoes of the company that is selling what you are stealing as well as the relative/friend you are stealing from.

-Empathy.


-Shoplifting/stealing is taking something that does not belong to you.  Spending money on it means it belongs to you.


-I put this in a simple way because it is exactly that - simple.  


-I used to shoplift when I was younger and I even stole from my parents (it was change out of a gigantic change jar).  They caught me and told me that they had been putting money into that jar for 19 years - when my brother was born - and hadn't taken a penny out of it since.  My mother was in tears.  It broke my heart.. I have been turned off from even the thought of it since, it makes me physically lurch whenever I think of stealing from someone.

-My point here is that it's all experience.  Getting caught and fined won't do it unless it has an emotional/sentimental attachment.  An EXTREME example: you steal the last of a specific OTC medication; someone has a 10 minute window and rushes to buy it for an emergency and they cant, emergency is now fatal.  Another example: friend has been saving up money to spend on their loved one or even YOU; you take it and they cannot spend that anymore, leading to a broken friendship as well as leaving them disappointed.


-Realize that product X had begun somewhere.  Despite how established the company or distributor is, they have spent X amount of time building that company up from the ground.  Blood, sweat and tears.  Taking stuff is ignorant, to put it lightly.


-Now, imagine someone stealing from you/your products that you have spent so much time creating and perfecting.  You'd be livid.


Hope this helps!

I need ways on how to stop, i dont want to go see a therapist. I don't need money because i have that as well. What is the reasoning for me doing this? how can i stop? ";122;"I agree with everyone else, a therapist would be the best bet.  
  
But, I'd like to approach your question here when you asked 
  
&gt; What is the reasoning for me doing this?  
  
You've already given part of the answer when you said:  
  
&gt; I got a nice rush out of it   
  
&gt; I don't even feel bad when i do it, i feel a nice rush? 
   
That ""rush"" you're feeling is a combination of dopamine and endorphins.  Those are chemicals that are released in your brain in response to you seeing or doing things, often things that are thrilling or dangerous -- and they make you feel good.      
  
&gt; and my friends would ""look up to me"" because of how good I'd gotten at it  
  
That ""look up to me"" feeling is serotonin, the chemical in your brain that gets released when you feel powerful or important.  
  
It's important to know that these chemical responses evolved in our brains back when human's lives were very different, and also that they don't work perfectly to keep us safe at all times.  Maybe a long time ago, chasing down a deer or making a pass at an attractive guy would have been the things to give you a ""nice rush.""  Bringing food back to the village might've given you that 'look up to me' feeling.  
  
And there are still a ton of ways in today's society that can lead to those same feelings -- sports and working out, falling in love, sex, crushing it at work or school, etc.  
  
But you're getting that rush in an unhealthy way.  And, what's more, you're getting stuck in an addiction or addiction-like loop.  

Your brain wasn't made to escape from a rampaging lion a few times a day, over and over; but that's the kind of stimulation you're giving it by shopliting so much.  Over and over, you're dousing your brain in these ""emergency"" chemicals that feel scary/good -- much more than your brain is supposed to handle.  What happens when you do that?  Well, you know exactly what happens, because you're experiencing it.  

Over time, your brain gets less and less sensitive to the chemicals, so you need more and more to feel the same high.  This is why drug addicts do more and more drugs as they become dependent -- and why you've graduated from stealing candy to stealing from your parents and friends.    
  
This isn't good -- **you're not doing it because it's what you want to do, you're doing it because your brain craves that stimulation.**  
  
Also over time, your brain gets almost ""used"" to the rush, and expects it.  It builds a chemical pattern, expecting to be made 'high', so it doesn't produce a steady even stream of 'normal' chemicals and patterns, but 'hunkers down' expecting you to super-stimulate it.  This is why drug addicts eventually need to shoot up just to ""feel normal,"" and why you can't stop stealing even if you want to.   
  
Hope this helps.  
  
PS -- other people here have suggested Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and you should just know that extensive scientific study has proven that CBT treatment can reverse problems like the one you're having.

";122;"It sounds like classic kleptomania but the only intervention we have rn is pharmocological and I don't know if that's completely necessary for an impulse control disorder. I would suggest CBT and dangle in the possibility of seeing a hypnotist which is like CBT on steroids.

That said, your desire to steal seems to be limited to makeup (with some minor stuff like candy and bracelets, and with clothes as basically a temptation). That's an outlier in kleptomania cases because kleptomania involves stealing random shit and is an impulse control disorder; kleptomaniacs don't plan a trip to the mall in order to steal clothes and shoes, they see something lying there and impulsively grab it and keep it. Are you going into stores with a plan to buy something? Or are you going in specifically for the act of stealing, and the dopamine rush that results from it? My money is on the later. It's fun to steal, and you get stuff without paying for it, and you want the stuff you steal.

I would suggest trying to keep a fully assembled makeup collection and never touch it. If you have nail polish and don't use it, you might not be tempted to acquire more. Same goes for every other product. Your brain could be trying to assemble all the things you want, and especially if you're burning through your supply you might be trying to fill the holes in your collection. This is just a theory and will not replace good solid therapy with a real therapist. 

Note: Therapists are obligated to not call law enforcement on you. You will never be in legal trouble for admitting theft to a therapist. I think you'll find that if you talk to a therapist about your actions, it'll be easier than you think to both talk about the causes and find the solutions.";5;0.040983606557377046;[[0.96397721]];[[0.6549613]];-0.9764;0.115;0.741;0.14400000000000002;-0.9887;0.07;0.772;0.159;0.06000000000000001;0.15737179487179487;0.05112433862433861;0.10624745624745624
[NeedAdvice] how do i stop stealing;t3_88tsd4;41;"So just off the bat, I have a shoplifting problem.

I remember the first time i stole was like candy bars at the dollar store when i was 8 or 9. 

I remember being in the 4th grade and i stole a SHIT TON of make up from some fancy department store. 

A few days later i was at the flea market and my mom caught me stealing a nail polish. 

This started again when i was in the 9th grade. 

It was small stuff at first, a lipstick, a chocolate bar, a bracelet.

Then it went to me stealing hundreds of dollars worth of make up from sephora.

I started stealing clothes, i figured out a way to get rid of the security tag and i was very slick with it too.

From the 9th grade to the 12th grade i had stolen maybe a good $10,000 worth of stuff and hadn't gotten caught (yet)

I started getting all my friends in on it and once a week my best friend and i would go to the mall after school steal a bunch of stuff and go home. 

It became a huge problem, even though i had a job, i had money, my parents were giving me money also, i just HAD to steal it. I got a nice rush out of it and my friends would ""look up to me"" because of how good I'd gotten at it. 

I started stealing money from my parents (mind you, they were still giving me an allowance anyway), from my friends, any time i saw something i liked, i took it!

Long story short, a year and a half ago, my friend and i had gone to the mall for our weekly shoplifting spree and we were headed out but she wanted to grab a lipstick so we went inside this store she got a lipstick as we walked out, a security guard stopped us.

He took us into the back, saw that we stole a bunch of stuff and called the cops. 

My friend and i both got arrested and charged (luckily we were 17 so the charges were dropped when we turned 18)

Did that stop me from stealing? nope. 

a few months ago i was stealing from a friends credit card and she found out and we stopped being friends.

I am currently typing this 20 minutes after having stolen some make up and clothes.

I don't even feel bad when i do it, i feel a nice rush? I dont know why i do it. I watched some dr phil and ive seen movies and people find some psychological reasoning for why they steal.

I remember the cop that arrested me told my parents ""this is a cry for attention""

Some extra perspective here, I’m a life coach specifically working with young adults ages 17-25 that are on probation. It’s a program where clients work with a therapist and a life coach (me) to get their lives back on track post incarceration. I cannot tell you how many young women I work with that were put in jail for stealing. The young women I work with would give anything to go back in time, and not do what got them in prison. The ones that didn’t learn now have a criminal record and it’s really hard finding them a job. Aside from the other catastrophic life consequences they face because of breaking the law.

They can't even work at Walmart. That's not a joke.

A few days later i was at the flea market and my mom caught me stealing a nail polish. 

This started again when i was in the 9th grade. 

It was small stuff at first, a lipstick, a chocolate bar, a bracelet.

Then it went to me stealing hundreds of dollars worth of make up from sephora.

I started stealing clothes, i figured out a way to get rid of the security tag and i was very slick with it too.

From the 9th grade to the 12th grade i had stolen maybe a good $10,000 worth of stuff and hadn't gotten caught (yet)

I started getting all my friends in on it and once a week my best friend and i would go to the mall after school steal a bunch of stuff and go home. 

It became a huge problem, even though i had a job, i had money, my parents were giving me money also, i just HAD to steal it. I got a nice rush out of it and my friends would ""look up to me"" because of how good I'd gotten at it. 

I started stealing money from my parents (mind you, they were still giving me an allowance anyway), from my friends, any time i saw something i liked, i took it!

Long story short, a year and a half ago, my friend and i had gone to the mall for our weekly shoplifting spree and we were headed out but she wanted to grab a lipstick so we went inside this store she got a lipstick as we walked out, a security guard stopped us.

He took us into the back, saw that we stole a bunch of stuff and called the cops. 

My friend and i both got arrested and charged (luckily we were 17 so the charges were dropped when we turned 18)

Did that stop me from stealing? nope. 

a few months ago i was stealing from a friends credit card and she found out and we stopped being friends.

I am currently typing this 20 minutes after having stolen some make up and clothes.

I don't even feel bad when i do it, i feel a nice rush? I dont know why i do it. I watched some dr phil and ive seen movies and people find some psychological reasoning for why they steal.

I remember the cop that arrested me told my parents ""this is a cry for attention"" 

this is not a cry for attention, the last thing i want is attention.

I need ways on how to stop, i dont want to go see a therapist. I don't need money because i have that as well. What is the reasoning for me doing this? how can i stop?

[NeedAdvice] how do i stop stealing;t3_88tsd4;41;"So just off the bat, I have a shoplifting problem.

I remember the first time i stole was like candy bars at the dollar store when i was 8 or 9. 

I remember being in the 4th grade and i stole a SHIT TON of make up from some fancy department store. 

A few days later i was at the flea market and my mom caught me stealing a nail polish. 

This started again when i was in the 9th grade. 

It was small stuff at first, a lipstick, a chocolate bar, a bracelet.

Then it went to me stealing hundreds of dollars worth of make up from sephora.

I started stealing clothes, i figured out a way to get rid of the security tag and i was very slick with it too.

From the 9th grade to the 12th grade i had stolen maybe a good $10,000 worth of stuff and hadn't gotten caught (yet)

I started getting all my friends in on it and once a week my best friend and i would go to the mall after school steal a bunch of stuff and go home. 

It became a huge problem, even though i had a job, i had money, my parents were giving me money also, i just HAD to steal it. I got a nice rush out of it and my friends would ""look up to me"" because of how good I'd gotten at it. 

I started stealing money from my parents (mind you, they were still giving me an allowance anyway), from my friends, any time i saw something i liked, i took it!

Long story short, a year and a half ago, my friend and i had gone to the mall for our weekly shoplifting spree and we were headed out but she wanted to grab a lipstick so we went inside this store she got a lipstick as we walked out, a security guard stopped us.

He took us into the back, saw that we stole a bunch of stuff and called the cops. 

My friend and i both got arrested and charged (luckily we were 17 so the charges were dropped when we turned 18)

Did that stop me from stealing? nope. 

a few months ago i was stealing from a friends credit card and she found out and we stopped being friends.

I am currently typing this 20 minutes after having stolen some make up and clothes.

I don't even feel bad when i do it, i feel a nice rush? I dont know why i do it. I watched some dr phil and ive seen movies and people find some psychological reasoning for why they steal.

I remember the cop that arrested me told my parents ""this is a cry for attention"" 

this is not a cry for attention, the last thing i want is attention.

";122;"People can get addicted to strong chemicals released by their own brains, especially when the person is under stress or in danger, and suddenly the tension is released. 

That's why people can get addicted to activities that don't necessarily involve taking external drugs or alcohol. 

People can get addicted to all sorts of ""risk-taking"" behaviors that become ""compulsive"", including gambling, sex, lying, and even extreme sports (""adrenaline junkies"").

Addiction to harmful and destructive behaviors frequently results in incarceration, institutionalization, or death; even knowing that fact usually isn't enough to stop a person caught up in the vicious cycle of an addiction.

The first step to recovery from addiction is admitting you have a problem. You've already done that with this post.

The second step is to get help from a qualified professional you can trust, who has experience and a good track record in treating kleptomania. 

Do some research on different treatment methods, and then find a licensed professional in your area who can work with you to let go of your compulsion to steal. 

Joining a recovery community (like a 12-step group or a group based on another addiction recovery model) can also be enormously helpful, to be honest with others about something you might otherwise be embarrassed to admit, and also to give support to others who are bravely working to achieve similar recoveries.

Try setting rules. Like before stealing you have to think about the people you're hurting. And no excuses like it's a big brand, it goes back to regular people and employees having to pay more. Every time someone steals $10, that's $10 more everyone else has to pay to make up for it.  
Add more rules till you think of them so you have like 3-5 that help stop you from stealing. Another is thinking about the fear of getting caught again. What that would do to your life, what your parents might think of you.

check out r/kratom

IF you are doing i because it is an addiction and you are getting a chemical rush in the brain, kratom can help even that out. I say this because it hits some of the same receptors that opiates do (without being an opiate) which signal pleasure in your brain. People who are addicted to drugs,including alcohol, cigarettes, weed (yes, you can have a mental addiction to weed), or even unhealthy eating when it's done for emotional reasons have written about being helped by kratom.

However, don't be stupid and abuse it-- it won't kill you but you can take too much to the point where it won't affect you and then there are withdrawals which can be a bit unpleasant. So don't take kratom extracts because they shoot your tolerance through the roof.

There are several vendors to recommend who are in the $3-5/oz (which should be 7-15 doses) range. You can search the bakc history. Unfortunately, there's a lot of money to be made in opiates, and there's some serious political clout trying to make kratom illegal (and may already be in your state) so r/kratom is fighting to continue allowing sourcing. You'll have to search the sub and look up vendors from there.";-9;-0.07377049180327869;[[0.9613748]];[[0.4222348]];-0.9764;0.115;0.741;0.14400000000000002;-0.7525;0.096;0.787;0.11699999999999999;-0.00799999999999998;0.15737179487179487;-0.2416666666666667;0.3990384615384616

Some pointers, think about when you eat and in what quantities you eat.

I've found that eating more closer to bed time will cause me to sleep longer or not have as refreshing a sleep.

Hypothesis is that blood is drawn towards digestive systems and so less energy and resources available to let your body do its thing when it sleeps (rest and recovery) so draws out the process.

Generally having either an earlier dinner or a lighter dinner and easily digestible one works out well.

Also another big thing could actually be what you eat. Generally meat takes much longer for our bodies to process and digest, whereas fruits and veges can pass through quite easily.

Other alternative is to train your body to get 8 hours of sleep by using an alarm.

So I have used this knowledge about my own sleep pattern to slowly correct my delayed sleep.

For years, I used to fall asleep around 4am but I have corrected that to falling asleep around 12 to 1am. Yay me! 


But there is one issue which is hindering me from shifting my sleep earlier and if ignored, actually delaying my sleep back to my old timings. It seems that my body decides to sleep for 9.5 hours if I decide to wake up without an alarm. Sometimes even closer to 10 hours a night.

This causes a problem for me because I cannot fall asleep unless I have stayed awake for nearly 15 hours and had a workout. If I go to bed too early it upsets my sleep and delays it further. 

Is there any way I can reduced the sleep time to a decent 8 hours a night without using alarms? It would help me so much with my routine and would fix my sleep routine completely. 

I am doing all the jazz to improve my sleep quality and hygiene like

Using flux in evening

Destressing by walks

Working out regularly

Vit d3, k2, magnesium, zinc supplementatuon

Healthy diet

Pitch dark and cool bedroom

No phone hours before bed etc

Caffeine never kept me up at night, so I resisted giving it up for years. But when I finally gave it up for a month as an experiment I found I needed less sleep, and it was so much easier to wake up in the mornings.

The light box is a new addition, but it's been amazing. The trick for me is to use it as soon *as I wake up* for about thirty minutes. It helps me wake up in the morning, but most importantly I find it so much easier to fall asleep at a reasonable time. I didn't expect that, so it was a pleasant discovery.

Edit: Just knowing I wrote this and put it out there helped me a bit.";8;"When I was a medical student I tried to figure out whether my procrastination came from anxiety (used Escitalopram during my most stressful courses) or whether that anxiety and procrastination came from undiagnosed ADHD ( GP diagnosed me as trialled methylphenidate then dextroamphetamine). I realised that for me having mental focus really helped me not be so inattentive but the discipline repair came from more habit forming techniques and realising that I lapse when I'm sleep deprived. I printed off a calendar for study goals and had it on my desk, and I had a Star stamp to ""complete"" with. When I could see the data there at my procrastination station I find it much easier to hit my goals. Also your daily study goals are way too high. To start of you won't have the endurance. Start with two weeks of 1 hour per day and limit the amount of reading and highlighting as we know that is low yield and more prone to skip rust than quizzing or flash cards for example. Honestly many can do really well with just an hour or two of daily study. To catch up skip to high yield study like finding your knowledge gaps in medbullet.com quizzes or MKSAP5 exams. Then you can focus on a topic.
When you're seeing patients read a bit about what ever your ward is full of and answer one random question (What is G6PD pathophys?) Then you slowly add to your repurpose. Also keep ward note books for managing cases, it will be your high yield study guide for the future.

For a bit more context: I used to be a straight A student, working several hours each day. I remember being able to stay at my desk for hours on end. I guess my work ethic was torn apart by the onset of clinical depression (5th grade). And eventhough I'm kinda sorta okay now, my work ethic never recovered.

Imagine somebody who runs marathons regularly. Then imagine they have an accident or something, and stops doing it for a year or two. Do you think they can return to running marathons regularly? Not really, right?

My point is you have to first of all accept that your discipline 'muscle' has become weak - and you gotta start slow and rebuild it proper. If you have a mindset that you *ought* to be able to sit down and work hours on end, well, then you're going to fail quickly.

Your attention span has been throttled by social media ( and of course the depression didn't exactly help!). Best way to get back on track is to slowly train your brain to focus again. Self discipline is like a muscle. It weakens if not used, but can be developed again. You are not broken, nothing is wrong with you. You just need to work that muscle again. 

1. Get a 2 bits of paper and a writing utensil.
On the 1st piece of paper, that's your to do list. Just put your tasks in order of most important. Only put like, 3 tasks to start. Even if you have more, if you're overwhelmed you wont get anything done, so just focus on a few. 

2. On the other paper, leave it blank. While you're working on your task, if anything pops up in your head to do, write it down. If you want to google something random, make tea, message x about whatever, write it down and deal with it on your break- it can wait 10 minutes.
 
3. Get a timer. Like a little fridge timer, but you can use your phone- just set it to airplane mode so you don't go online. 

4. Set it for 10 minutes. For those 10 minutes, focus on your task. When the timer goes off you get a 2 minute break- set the timer for that.
For those 2-3 minutes, do whatever you want. Tackle something on the to do list that popped into your head. Even if you'd rather keep working on the task, take the break. 

5.When the timer goes off again, go back to work for 10 minutes!  Do this for an hour. You just studied (or whatever), for about 45 minutes!

The idea is to gradually increase from 10 minute increments, and make it so your brain actually WANTS to work on the task.

Good luck. I dealt with depression a lot on my early 20s. You're at the best part of your life to start developing the tools to handle it.

If 10 minutes is too long, start with 5 and don't beat yourself up (I'm lookin' at you, depression!). It isn't personal. It's not a flaw. It's just what happens when you don't use a certain skill for a while- it weakens. Just like a weightlifter has to drop weight when they miss a few months you have to drop weight in terms of your attention span. If you must beat yourself up, set the timer for 1 minute and let yourself have it for ONLY one minute. When times, up, get back on track. 

You're doing your best, you will improve. ";23;0.2233009708737864;[[0.96745478]];[[0.59841728]];-0.9392;0.044000000000000004;0.799;0.157;0.9778;0.10800000000000001;0.8320000000000001;0.06;-0.161;0.06623931623931623;0.12345478595478596;-0.05721546971546972

For me, if I want to get something done I break it down into smaller tasks, and I set a goal of 2 tasks per day minimum, and any more is a bonus that I should be proud of.

There is always a personal hell you can let your life devolve into. Since positive motivation come and go you must have a clear vision at least of what you should absolutely run away from and then that can be your last ditch motivation when your positive motivations are absent. You need to clearly define what hell you are running away from. 

I would also suggest you begin practicing willpower exercises. Willpower is the strength to force yourself to override your desires. One way you can practice this is by taking a cold shower. The purpose is to learn to make your body do what you tell it to do regardless of comfort. Making yourself study or do homework is childs play when you have a clear vision of the hell you are running from and the strength to sacrifice your present comfort in exchange for future gains.

I’m 26 years old and a freshman in college. The thing I notice that most of my fellow freshman is procrastinate. Treat this like a job and it will pay off more. Don’t just show up to your classes and then go home and study. 

I have classes from about 10-2 back to back, not counting labs. I show up at 7:30 every morning after I drop my kid at daycare and I do homework and study until class. I then usually stay until around 5 pm doing the same thing. I then go pick up my kid and go home. I have to do this because I will just hangout with my kid and wife at home and not study. This will require discipline though. Don’t browse Facebook or reddit while you are there. Actively work on something or study. If you finish early then leave and go home and do your leisurely activities. 

Lastly, study somewhere in public but quiet. I like to go to the computer labs on campus. This can keep you accountable from getting distracted in your room.

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"I’m going to shoot from the hip here and make tons of wild assumptions without asking any questions. mostly drawing from my own experience. 

Something has fucked you up. That’s OK though, everybody gets fucked up in different ways. It’s part of growing up. No one gets to have the perfect everything for their development. Giving up on your environment is a good way to retreat into your head and disassociate from the world around you. This is something people learn when they didn’t have any control over their environment for a period of time they just let go and submit to the idea that there’s nothing they can do about their environment. And even if they muster he strength to do something about their environment, it is usually met with “ok but what’s the point? It won’t change anything in the long run. It will just get messy again.” This all stems from a viewpoint that nothing is ever good enough. The work will never be done. The work will never be done well enough. It’s not worth the effort because the task has no end in sight. 

Strategies I use: 

1. Do nice thing for yourself each morning. It seriously doesn’t matter what it is as long as it’s not unhealthy. I make myself a superfood smoothy. Don’t beat yourself up for missing a day or a week, but do leave a reminder somewhere if it helps. Discipline takes time. 

2. Instead of personalizing the tasks pretend you’re helping someone else. If you’re alone try interacting with a fictitious character who needs your help. I say things like, “I think these books can go on the shelf over there and we can probably just throw this thing away, right?” I sometimes get weird with it and name the person. Like I’m helping “Frank” clean the house. Frank generally becomes the embodiment of all your resistance, but is also very compliant. Frank doesn’t care where the book goes or what you throw away. 

3. Don’t do tasks, put in time. Set a timer for a 10 minute living room cleaning session. When the timer goes off have a seat and sip some hot coco and celebrate your effort. Or just clap for yourself and say “yay I did it! I’m awesome!” Then check in and see if you’d like to do another 10 or to call it good for today. Both are equally fine. May feel ridiculous to celebrate something that seems so tiny, but it’s actually very powerful because you have to be able to celebrate the smallest thing before you can move on and celebrate huge accomplishment. The satisfaction of your effort is a form of self acceptance that is learned in a cumulative way, in my humble opinion. It’s not silly to celebrate the tiny things: its HUGE. It’s everything. It’s the pinhole of light leading you out of a dark place. The “ not good enough” gremlins are in your head trying to convince you not to feel good about anything you do. Show them who’s boss and say “I don’t give a fuck what you gremlins think. I get to be proud of myself.”

4. I think it’s important to have a list of things you would like to get done and to write it in a way that is about what you want to do vs “have to do” and what needs that it meets. EG:  I don’t have to do anything, but I want to/choose to clean my living room because it meets my needs for order and peaceful spaces. When I spend time in a clean living room it helps me relax and feel at peace. The goal is to retrain your brain to approach tasks like something you’re doing for yourself and that the impossible standards that others have placed on you aren’t in play anymore. 

I’m not perfect at this and I have other mental health issues that make it difficult to keep these strategies constantly in the foreground, but I believe these things and know that they help me tons. 

For me everything revolves around pre planning. Anything I don’t plan it advance falls apart. Eating poorly is because I didn’t plan for my week’s meals and go grocery shopping. If my house is messy it’s because I didn’t plan and schedule a time to clean it. If I don’t plan, 1000 things are screaming for my attention and I don’t get anything done because I don’t know what choices to make. Plans, lists, and structures are ideas that I am recovering from a hatred of because of childhood trauma. In reality, they are my best friends that I had believed nasty rumors about. They are not oppressive. They are empowering. I may have internalized a belief that they’re all there to hurt me, but in reality they are my three best friends waiting for me to see that they’ve been there for me all along. Waiting to hang out together and live a meaningful life.

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"Stop thinking of it as motivation, when you label it as motivation it means it's a resource that comes and goes.

A few things that have helped me are as follows:

*  Have a uniform: I wear the same black [pants](https://www.betabrand.com/womens/pants/dress-pant-yoga-pants-collection/womens-black-straight-fit-dress-pant-yoga-pants) every day to work with sweaters, black flats, and jewelry every day in the winter because I hate shaving my legs. 

&amp;nbsp;

*  Minimize/Simplify: Nothing helped me as much as getting rid of my stuff. It's easy for me to find things, and even when the apartment is totally ""trashed"" it takes me 2 hours max to clean it. Read *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,* and *Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism* and *L'arte de la Simplicité* (I recommend in that order). All are available on Amazon. Tl;dr: Discard down to the bare minimum that you want, make sure literally *everything* in your house has a home, don't use something and leave it away from its home, keep all your counters bare and easy to clean instead of keeping appliances handy. 

&amp;nbsp;

*  Establish anchor habits: These are small, motivating, daily habits. Even if everything else in my life has gone to hell, I make my bed in the morning, brush my teeth twice a day, floss once a day, and write in my journal. I started building these habits by making my bed. It takes less than a minute and can be really motivating. (I didn't start building these habits until the decluttering was done).

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"&gt; I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained from years of being a garbage person.

This realization is more powerful than you may realize at first. I've been around this subreddit for a bit, and have constantly come across people that seem to struggle from this general thing. They always struggle with bad habits and routines, and though they are aware of their bad lifestyle, and though they want to change, they can't seem to figure out **how** to change for the better. And not only change, but maintain that change once it's been implemented. I'm here today to share with you my personal findings in discipline and good habit forming, so take a seat! 

&amp;nbsp; 

**STEP 1: MINDSET**
The most important aspect for you to improve on, starting this moment, is improving your mindset. If you've got a positive mindset, nothing in this world will be able to stop you. You've got a struggling mindset right now, and it's something that is holding you back from maintaining those awesome habits that you're trying to form. What you think about most, and the way in which you view your mentally is how you will outwardly express yourself towards others, as well as yourself. There are many different ways adjust and improve your mindset, though I'm going to recommend the way in which I was able to adjust my mindset. YouTube.  Literally pulling up YouTube and typing in mindset motivation and listening to the speeches and podcasts I'd come across gradually helped me come to realize how important mindset was. To this day, I will always recommend mindset above all else. Improve your mindset, and you **will** improve your life. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**STEP 2: RESPONSIBILITY**
You seem to have a good foundation of responsibility. You know you have issues, but you're owning up to those issues you're going through and coming here for help and guidance. That's awesome. There is a hidden secret in the phrase: **take responsibility for your actions** that not too many talk about. Generally, when we hear that phrase, we think about taking responsibility for our fuck-ups and taking whatever consequence that follows. However, taking responsibility for **your** actions also means that those actions are the only ones you have any control over. You can't control anyone else other than yourself, and in that control, you control both your conscious actions and decisions. This is important, because when you want to make a change, you're entirely capable of making that choice. It simply takes a decision, and action to back up that decision. You've personally experienced this, as you've mentioned: 

&gt; I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week.

&amp;nbsp; 

Now we need to address why you're having this trouble in maintaining your desirable habits and constantly falling back into your bad habits. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**STEP 3: PERSISTENCE**
This is the secret to your problem. Whenever someone wants to make a change in their life, they're literally fighting their own self in implement this change. What do I mean by this? As you've stated in your post, your bad habits are **ingrained** within you from years of performing those same tasks, actions and decisions over and over again. You're exactly right, those habits are ingrained within you. They have become second nature, something that your mind and body perform without you having to put much thought into it. They find familiarity and comfort in these actions. The worst part of this, is that it doesn't matter if the habit is good or bad for you. Once it's performed and done enough times for your mind and body to become comfortable with it, **BOOM**, you've formed a new habit. 

So, how do you break these habits once they've formed? Simple. You force yourself to perform new actions and gradually break out of the previous comfortable actions to implement these new desirable actions. **That is the secret to forming new habits**. Will it be difficult? Of course, you already have experience in this difficulty. But while people know it will be difficult, they don't understand **why** it's difficult. So, allow me to explain that as well. 

&amp;nbsp; 

As I've said, when you form a habit, it becomes second nature for you. It's something you can perform without thinking because your body and mind have become so familiar and comfortable with said action. However, once you try to change that action, your meet resistance. I know you've heard lots of times how our minds and body are programmed to exert the least amount of energy as possible, and it does it's best to keep us comfortable and safe. **Comfortable &amp; Safe** are what these habits are. Not specifically safe, obviously, but once you've become accustomed to something, your body finds comfort in said task, making you feel safe. What happens when your put in an unsafe and uncomfortable position naturally? Your body rejects the situation and tries to get you out of it as fast as possible. Fight or Flight as it's usually called. 

&amp;nbsp; 

When you try to implement new habits into your life, initially they're uncomfortable because they're new things that your mind and body haven't been exposed to. Your mind them sends those resistance signals to get you to stop and go back to what was comfortable. You'll make excuse after excuse to convince yourself to stop whatever new habit you're trying to form and convince yourself you can take it easy, take a break or do something else. If you want to implement new habits, you've got to push past that resistance and continue those actions anyway. Only then will you gradually become comfortable with them and then they'll become second nature. 

&amp;nbsp; 

So many times you hear motivational speakers tell us ""JUST DO IT"", but so many people brush this off thinking they already know they **have** to do it. Yes, you have to do it, but you've got to understand the **reason** for why you have to just do it, regardless of how you're feeling. You aren't just forcing yourself to do said task, you are literally breaking out of your comfort with the previous task and slowly building that new comfort in the habit you want to build.

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"&gt; Literally any advice at all would be appreciated.

So ask your special guy to help you learn to be more like him.  That way you're spending time together, he's teaching you a new skill, and your motivation can be to keep him coming over to your place.  It's a win/win/win.";6;0.021201413427561835;[[0.94252598]];[[0.40268038]];0.9028;0.152;0.703;0.145;0.9209999999999999;0.243;0.757;0.0;-0.23600000000000002;0.04387436394015345;0.2983766233766234;-0.25450225943647004

But I think the most productive way to have a productive morning is actually to set yourself up the day before. Set aside 30-45 min each evening to plan out the next day and particular they next morning. 

One way would be to use the X method (check out https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/) to track if you're actually doing the things your set out to do. 

For starters I would sit down tonight and plan out 5 things you will do in the morning along with when you're going to get up. Be realistic. If you normally get up at 7:30, set a goal for 7:15. Then list out the five things you are going to do. 
For example, my routine is:

* Brew Tea &amp; make coffee
* Empty Dishwasher
* 20 min of Yoga
* Insert Contacts &amp; Brush Teeth
* Breakfast

Mine has expanded over time, but this a simple list that includes things that I would normally do but the sequence gives me structure. 

This way you can slowly get up earlier and earlier add tasks that will give you focus throughout the day.

For example, a lot of your problems seem to come from waking up late and feeling tired. Have you considered that you could be a long sleeper?

My boyfriend made me shape up, he told me ""how could I ever expect a future with someone who runs a household like this, you would teach our kids terrible habits and it's frankly disgusting"" and he's right, I now set an alarm on my phone to clean for only ten minutes every day, and try to clean up as I go. I make it as easy for myself as possible. I play Netflix while I clean. I make small missions ""hang up three pieces of clothing a day"". And buy things like swiffers and magic clean erasers to make cleaning easier.  Make small to do lists ad buy fun cleaning gadgets are my best advice.  You're going to be happier and feel more energized. I honestly look around my room and feel calmer.

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"I think you're beating yourself up too much over this. From what you wrote you have a career which you're doing okay in, and a relationship you care about. That's a hell of a lot more than many people have. There are people who are working retail who go home alone every night... So yeah, you're not doing as bad as you think you're doing so stop beating yourself up. Life is hard. 

Second. In my 41 years on this earth I've learned one thing that makes sense. The only person you should be comparing yourself to is you yesterday. Everyone you meet that you think is living the easy life is carrying a burden that you can't see. Some might even make yours seem almost like a gift.

JFK lived a fairy tale life right? Wealth, power, looks, charisma, intelligence, respect, a beautiful wife, courage... everyone would have given their left arm to be JKF. Well, I bet you didn't know that he suffered from excruciating and almost constant back pain and took 8 medications a day just to function. He was hospitalized for back and GI issues 9 times and had to have procaine injections into his back before news conferences where he had to stand for long periods of time, and couldn't put a sock or show on his left foot without help... 

So yeah. The bhuddists, christians, jews, and daoists all got it right. Life IS suffering and there is nothing on this earth more real or universal than suffering. The question is what you do about it... 

Next you need to realize that success is about habit, not talent, not motivation, not any magical power that you're lacking. Habit. Well, okay, habit and intelligence, but you clearly have no problems with the latter. 

The idea is to build habits that propel you forward instead of habits that drag you down. 

Start small. Start with something you can probably control. Your room.    

I have a friend who is a psychiatrist and this is what she recommends for people who want to form good habits or get more work done. If you create a crazy person weekly schedule of cleaning and working out and writing or whatever you want to do, you're going to freak out and give up. It's too overwhelming... But maybe you can manage ten minutes a day? I think you can. 

Instead, you need to bargain with yourself. So make a point to spend AT LEAST ten minutes cleaning every day when you get home from work. You can spend more than ten minutes, but you need to spend at least ten minutes. After that ten minutes passes, you're going to find that you don't want to stop some days and you're going to spend hours getting shit together. Some days you're going to hate every second of it and go right back to reddit after that ten minutes is over. As long as you do your ten minutes you can reward yourself. 

Once you do this for a week or so you will be amazed at how much you can accomplish with just ten minutes a day. Now that you're room is humming along, start trying to fix other things with the same strategy. Big project you've been putting off at work? Force yourself to work on it for just five minutes. Most of the time you're probably just going to say the hell with it and get the whole damn thing done. 

By the way, this is the same philosophy that the military use to instill a work ethic in basic training. You make your bed every morning and a drill sergeant inspects it. If it's not perfect, you get chewed out. Sounds harsh, but imagine what would happen if you started each morning doing something constructive WELL. Doing something that only takes a few minutes, but making sure you kick it's ass. That will extend into your day.  

Good luck, and let me know if you want to PM with a curmudgeonly old guy to get yourself on track.

It simplifies getting dressed in the morning so much, but it also leaves you with clothes you feel comfortable and confident in. (At least that's the idea.) It really helped me personally when I felt like I never dressed nice anymore and was always wearing the same stuff and it became a stress factor for me. ;4;0.014134275618374558;[[0.95734378]];[[0.47153587]];0.9028;0.152;0.703;0.145;0.902;0.19699999999999998;0.736;0.067;-0.12300000000000001;0.04387436394015345;0.2512820512820513;-0.20740768734189788

I'm also lazy as fuck by nature and this approach will require a tiny bit of self discipline but only a tiny bit.

Sit down and write out, on paper, a list of things that you need to do to clean up your house/life. A to-do list. Post it on the fridge or the door.

Do one of your clean outs.

Then after the clean out, when you are refreshed by the reset, don't work so hard. Instead, every day when you get home from work, do *one* of the things on your list (ie sweep, take out trash, do laundry, whatever). Just one. Then you can relax. It should take like 5 minutes to do one thing. Treat it like an extension of your work schedule. Then do whatever else you want to do with your day. Sit down, have a drink, play video games, hang out with your partner, etc.

When you do your cleanout, clean out your fridge as well. Buy groceries, but instead pick things that are super easy. If this means buying a bunch of ramen or instant soup cups/mac and cheese you can put in the microwave or some shit, that's fine. It's a start. Then every day, make it a point to ""make"" one meal. You can eat out still if you want--baby steps. But one meal should be something you already have in the house. This is a matter of saving money. If it's something you put in the microwave for 2 minutes that's cool.

If you start craving nicer food, then try and cook a recipe maybe once a week, and this will get you started towards a better diet as well.";3;0.010600706713780918;[[0.95503253]];[[0.71063664]];0.9028;0.152;0.703;0.145;0.9939;0.192;0.773;0.035;-0.15;0.04387436394015345;0.10774853801169593;-0.06387417407154247

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"Sounds like you are suffering from a severe lack of sleep. Lack of sleep will drain your soul and put you in a state of ""merely circling the drain slowly.""

As for food/weight, it kinda sounds like you need to get a foothold on other parts of your life before you can nail a diet. Try to jot down your typically weekly diet (accurate is good but a general picture is fine... You know how often you get pizza and takeout)... Think about what you drink. Are you a energy drink person or sugared-up coffee person?

Don't even worry about calories at the moment; just try to do markedly better than normal. Even if you just go from 3 Red Bulls a day to 2, that is better and you will feel better. Instead of the large pizza, get a medium, and/or save half of it for lunch tomorrow.  Don't go to whole foods and buy a bunch of kale or cucumber water that will just go to waste.

The bottom line is you need energy to do the things you want to do, and getting enough sleep and not committing carbicide will help you feel better and have a little more energy throughout the day to take care of some business. The 1200cal diet can wait. Another thing you might consider is Intermittent fasting. If you can go 12-14hrs in a row without eating (I.e. stop eating by 10pm and don't have any calories until noon) you will probably feel a lot better. Then you can resume your typical intake and you'll actually feel better. Just don't try to make up for lost time, lol.

Anyhow, that's a few things to try. It won't fix your life but it can put a little more bounce in yourself to help prevent you from saying ""ah screw it"" ans not working on your life. Good Luck!

The one thing you need to get hardcore on is your sleep. If there is anything you need to really push yourself on, it's sleep.

My opinion you should do two things.

1. Set goals that really excite and motivate you. With emphasis on what the goal will get you. Not on what the steps needed to achieve it are stopping you from doing.

2. Try to implement some small daily changes into your routine that hello to address these problems.  IE: Drink a gallon of water a day, wake up 20 minutes early.

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"I'd like the idea ""If it takes less than a minute, do it now"" I don't appl it consistently, but when I'm about to drop my clothes on the for, it crosses my mind and I chuck them at the laundry basket instead. An extra two seconds. If I see a tiny mess, instead of spending a few seconds thinking how shit I am, I pick it up. Tiny steps but I take pride in knowing I'm slowly improving. Celebrate any small step you manage, especially if it becomes habit.";2;0.007067137809187279;[[0.95639872]];[[0.5677469]];0.9028;0.152;0.703;0.145;0.4215;0.138;0.752;0.11;-0.021000000000000005;0.04387436394015345;-0.09469696969696972;0.13857133363712315

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"First of all, as some people have already said, take a moment to appreciate everything that is right in your life - everything that you *are* doing right. You are holding down a good job, have a relationship that makes you happy, are able to provide for yourself financially. These are not small accomplishments and you should feel proud of yourself. 

Secondly, there is always going to be something to improve in your life. So think about what's really important to you to change, and what is just a nice to have. Once you've nailed that down, work on building new habits. Here is a process that worked well for me. I read somewhere that it takes 30 days to build a new habit. So pick one thing and do it every day for the next 30 days. Maybe it is to spend 10 mins every evening tidying up. Not something so large that it's overwhelming and not something so small that you won't notice. A good sized, yet doable thing, that you will commit to doing every single day. For 30 days. If you don't do it one day, never mind, just do it the next day. Build this one habit. And then move on to add a second habit, for another 30 days. 

This is how you change your life - small, regular habits rather than large infrequent gestures. But before you start do take some time to think about what changes are really important to you. Remember that the more things on your todo list the more things there are to berate yourself for not doing. Also, if there's 20 things on your list and you did 10 of them it's hard to tell if you are moving your life forward in a meaningful way. Did you do all the trivial stuff and drop all the important stuff or not? So pick like 3 things - maybe (a) something about healthier eating habits. (b) something about feeling confident walking into work every morning and (c) something about self care, meditation / exercise / some small luxury that helps you remember every day how special you are.

One last thing - this person you are with wants to be with you, so treat him as an ally. Be open with him about what new habits you want to incorporate and what goals you want to achieve. His support can be incredibly helpful in achieving them.";1;0.0035335689045936395;[[0.96593899]];[[0.60623855]];0.9028;0.152;0.703;0.145;0.9932;0.13699999999999998;0.846;0.016;-0.114;0.04387436394015345;0.23456164431774196;-0.19068728037758848

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"First: you know the women (that seem to be put together to you) are probably looking at others whom they admire, and probably don't feel as put together and have the same ups and downs as yourself.  

As others say you're not garbage person (by seeing your own traits you want to improve you're already by definition not garbage. Most horrific people think they are fantastic while being total crap to other human beings... Anyway).   

Right now you are writing and having this moment of down, it's giving you motivation to change, but you also know it doesn't last. So the moments of feeling down don't work in the long run for you right?  

For me, everything is better when I focus on what makes ME truly happy, not immediately happy like eating sweets, but things that last, what feels great after I have done that thing.  I suppose that is discipline but that word always sounds like this harsh parent restricting you.  I like to think it's a search for true happiness and true freedom.  Easier said I know than done, but, start somewhere. For me it's easiest to find one angle I can get into and get obsessedabout for a while, like a one personal project just for me, not for others, not for work. Find one thing that bothers me and I just want to fix it or get it better. 

 For example, cleaning. I hated how my clothes just didn't have any system and it just got so messy so quickly.  I love to strip off everything after getting in the house, that's my personal pleasure, (lolz), but I just didn't like having to think about where it should have to go back (hence messy crap everywhere) so I watched a whole ton of YouTube organising videos and tried some of their tips like it was a hobby, for my own pleasure, started a system and kept it, now the thinking is much less ""thinking"" so I am much more likely to just put things back because there is a better set structure.  Maybe you need a new shelf, maybe you need to throw away stuff or make drawer dividers, whatever works for you, make sure you are happy doing that system. 

 You can also ask that person you are with how they do it, ask him what you think you don't know, how does he find the time to keep tidy things. 

One thing my other half tells me is that most of the tasks that feel ""huge"" are much less time consuming when you do it. But that doesn't work for me personally because I have a perfectionist tendency, so yes things could be time consuming, if I don't have a game plan I could literally clean and reorganise the house for a weekend and not have it complete.  So I just say OK, I want to fix this shoe area, it's always messy and how do people do that on YouTube and pinterest, I want to learn how to do make up or I want to learn how to---cook better. Then take those projects as a hobby for a bit until I settle into a routine that I enjoy then I wouldn't fall out of it because it's part of my happiness.

His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"Make your bed.

Changing your life takes time. Start with your habits, easiest to do ones first. Start by making your bed for 30 days in a row, for example. Takes 5 minutes, minimum effort, nothing to lose. Then let the momentum of your success help you create new, healthier routines.

Also, don't fear failure. Failure is an opportunity to learn, to reexamine what went wrong, in what did you err and how you think you can fix it next time. Then be kind to yourself, pick yourself up and try again.

I'm gonna give you some of the advice that my therapist has given me.

Step 1:

&gt;being a garbage person.

Stop that. One of the *most important steps* to having self confidence in your behavior is by being kinder to yourself. I know, it's kind of a sick amusement to call yourself trash. But it's bad for you in the long run, kind of like eating corndogs for lunch every day.

Step 2: You sound like you have the same problem I do, which is prioritizing and seeing the smaller picture. Don't look at your to\-do list as 'oh god I have 3489238238 things to do', but instead look at it as a 'let's see which of these I can accomplish today'. Make a 3 column list: Column A is things that absolutely have to get done today \(ex: mine would be 'do my coding homework, feed the cat dinner, drink enough water'\). The smaller the better, at the start. The key here is reorganizing your brain to associate 'getting things done' with 'hey, that felt good!' instead of 'oh god I only finished ONE thing'.  Column B is things that need to get done soon \(like cooking a multi\-serving dinner to eat for leftovers, or taking out the trash, or checking your budget. And you can define soon yourself...is it in three days? next week? this month?\), and Column C is things that aren't really priorities right now but still need to get done \(like buying new books, or researching a new car\). 

My therapist's mantra to me is ""Break it down into manageable pieces!"" Instead of having a task be ""clean the living room"", break it up into as many steps as you need to make sure you get it done. ""Throw away the trash on the table"", ""sort the mail"", ""put the bodies of my victims in the compost bin"", whatever.

Step 3: Don't yell at yourself when you don't meet your expectations. It's okay if you don't do everything every day.  Read  [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/) if you can, if you're anything like me it'll help you a lot.

Step 4: TAKE TIME TO REST. I know it's hard. There's so many things that need to be done. But doing them while at your last thread of sanity isn't a good way to live. Force yourself to enjoy things in the moment. Even if it's just walking to get the mail. Slow down your brain. It's going to be okay.

Additionally, you could always ask your boyfriend what he does. Or you could even ask him to help you with some of your tasks! Sometimes it's hard to fix shit mountain yourself when you can only move two turds at a time. I do the whole 'purge everything and start over' thing too, and it's not sustainable.

We'll be okay. You'll be okay. Take slow breaths. Any progress is good progress.";1;0.0035335689045936395;[[0.96480898]];[[0.6809329]];0.9028;0.152;0.703;0.145;0.9871;0.11900000000000001;0.833;0.048;-0.06399999999999999;0.04387436394015345;0.18725766986636552;-0.14338330592621207

What has worked for me within the past few weeks is just getting it done. For example: if I want to smoke weed, I’ll tell myself that the only way I can do it is if I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. Of which I do, then I allow myself to smoke weed and relax a bit. Same concept with anything in life really. Sure we may not want to be responsible and instead just kick back and relax but then that will make you go down a black hole.

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"I know you already have a lot of responses, but I wanted to add a few of my own tips/ways of tricking myself into being more disciplined.

1) 5 minute rule. If I'm thinking about procrastinating on a task that is going to take less than 5 minutes to do, just do it right then. For me, unloading the dishwasher or picking up my clothes. 

2) Think of your future self as a real person that doesn't have a lot of time. I thank my past self a lot when I wake up to a clean room or pre-packed lunches.

3) Just because you've slacked doesn't mean you should quit. I don't always follow my own advice, but it's important to remember that we're just human and we aren't perfect. The next day is a new day, the next hour is a new hour, the next minute is a new minute to try again. Just don't give up!

I might also recommend the book The Power of Habit. Quick and simple read that touches on a lot of things that people have mentioned here.";1;0.0035335689045936395;[[0.98291705]];[[0.57331518]];0.9028;0.152;0.703;0.145;0.8269;0.077;0.9;0.023;-0.046999999999999986;0.04387436394015345;0.17271497441951986;-0.1288406104793664
[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat.

The more you do the better you feel

Feeling good - David Burns

The root cause of procrastination is low self esteem and self confidence compared to a large task. So break down the task into really tiny steps and work on the perception of self esteem. Self esteem should not depend on anything or anyone or any acheivement. It is intrinsic. And when we feel guilt and shame we cut ourselves down .. procrastination then is fear and guilt cycling to make us do even less.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;Are you also seeing a doctor every so often? Aside from health issues, you don't sound depressed, just disorganized, but it might be worth talking to someone.

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care. Now that I'm in the professional world, I feel that my weight and my appearance are holding me back. As I age I know that being untidy will get more and more socially unacceptable. 

As an added complication, I'm seeing someone I really like and could see a future with. He's a huge time drain though, and I'm getting even less done because I would rather spend time with him. His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"I was in similar situation you described 2 years back and sharing my learnings to get back life.

Firstly the change won't come overnight, it takes time, efforts and patience to get the life we want. Since last two years I am working on improving my life and estimated that it will take another two years to get the life I want. 
Don't get scared by these numbers here. Everyone's story is different but everyone needs to fight their own battle.


Time Debt : 
Only way we can do more in the limited time we have is wise investment of time. Think of time as limited money we have and all the tasks in to do list are our time depts. Just like paying back loan we avoid unnecessary expenses and keep saving small amount in everything we do. We have to treat time we have in same manner. 
Start thinking about it. Which unplanned activities take away time from your schedule. Instead of being reactive, can you approach them proactively?

Usually not finding the things we need at right place at right time and spending time to find them leads to panic mode to search in especially in messy place. 

Start assigning places to stuff you use and make habit of keeping them at their respective places. It takes 15 seconds more to put clothes in laundry bag than throwing them on floor. 

Letting things pile up in unorganized manner and organizing them all at once needs more time , efforts and motivation. Instead of this approach, doing incremental work towards the organizing your place is always better. 

Maintain To do list. 
Get everything out of your head and put it on to do list. Our brain is thinking machine and we need not waste it by using it as storage. Its ok to have long do to list but analyze the to do list with following criteria: Urgency , Importance , proactive actions , regular chores , place to complete the activity. Push off the things to later which are not having definite deadline. Put reminders for regular chores in your mobile. 


2 Mins rule 
If anything takes less that 2 mins , get it done and out of your way.  
These activities take more time to maintain in to do list.

Also , anything takes more time while doing it for the first time. So don't get mad at yourself. Things will improve. Just keep moving forward.

His life is very well put together and I know he will expect maturity and responsibility from a partner. I'm falling short and it's becoming even more important to fix this. 

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things.

[NeedAdvice] can't seem to fix my garbage life;t3_84fnuc;53;"Hi guys, I need help fixing my garbage life. 

I'm a female in my early 20s and I've always struggled with laziness and procrastination. My habits are all terrible and engrained  from years of being a garbage person. 

I struggle between the life I want, and the life I have the energy to create. I want to do better, and I've tried several times, but my short bursts of motivation never make it even a week. 

Every single morning, I'm late to work. I barely have time to shower, much less fix my hair and put on make up. My clothes are sloppy, I wear the same pants every day because they're comfortable. 

My house is an absolute disaster. I have a habit of throwing clothes in the floor, keeping dishes in the sink, etc. I am too lazy to cook; I spend most of my money eating out. Any food I buy goes bad because it just sits in the fridge- I am absolutely so lazy that I won't eat anything that requires the slightest bit of preparation. 

As a result, not surprisingly, I am about 50 pounds overweight. I'm an accountant, but I never save money or practice good financial habits. My to do list is as long as my arm and every day, I do the bare minimum to get by. 

I admire the women that are well put together, take care of themselves, and keep their home clean and tidy. It is my goal to create that kind of lifestyle for myself, but every time I have tried, I always revert back to my old habits eventually. 

It was easy to get by this way in college. I could roll into class late every day looking like a slob and no one would care.

you are accepting own mistakes - which is so rare - almost no one accepts own mistakes / introspects.

take it easy - your problems aint that big as some of the other posts out there.

use right words - do not use words like garbage.


control your thoughts as much as possible - imagine you are already the person you wish to be - you are already pursuing your dreams.


pray 4 times a day

tell your partner - you are busy and do the work

post your plans in the daily plan thread on this sub and follow up with others.


do things that are little easy at first - pick the low hanging fruits.

eat out but eat healthy.

leave 10 minutes early from work and clean house.

hire a cleaner if you have money at first.

meet partner only once in a day - at evening for dinner so atleast your day time is saved.

pursue hobbies, give yourself fun - do what you like. 
example - i play basketball at night before sleeping.

meet other family members.

make other friends who are high standard people.

try not comparing yourself to pthers as you are uniquely gifted and uniquely designing your life.

excercise - just skip, jog in apartment while cleaning up.

buy new pants

account for money and time of your own using hledger.

be a bit strong like steel - dont give up easily.


dont analyse yourself every week - give it three months to turn around - my friend tells me not to judge myself for 6 months minimum.

teach accounting to others , give something to others , volunteer.

pray.

(upvote this post and comment on my posts in daily plan - dont want zero comments :)  )


very best wishes to you.

I'm amazed that I can stay out with him as late as I do, go home late, we both go to work in the morning and meet up again after. His life is as tidy as ever. My house is such a disaster that I'm embarrassed to have him over anymore. I simply do not understand how he and other people have the time and energy to be so efficient in life, while I'm exhausted every day and falling apart. 

Redditors- how did you break out of a cycle like this? Literally any advice at all would be appreciated. I need motivation that lasts longer than a week. I need to get my life together and accept that unpleasant tasks are a part of every day, and I'm always going to be tired. Help!!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your amazing advice. Every single one of you was helpful and I have made amazing progress. I also think I have found the root of my problem, and want to share for others in the same boat. 

The night after posting this, my boyfriend sat me down and said ""I like you, you're great, but I don't think I could ever live with you because of how you are."" OUCH. Just what I had feared.

So I asked him how he keeps his life in order, as one of you suggested. What he said wasn't initially helpful at all, but a few days later something clicked. 

You see, it BOTHERS him when things are out of place. Not just when he has company over and there's a mess, it bothers him when he is home alone. Not just when he's walking in late to work, the idea of being late bothers him as soon as he wakes up. Having things left on his to do list BOTHERS him. 

This may seem so simple, but I realized that I wasn't actually being bothered by the things wrong in my life. I'm not lazy, I'm not a slob, I'm just reallllly good at blocking things out. I grew up in a crazy environment that I couldn't control, so I learned to mentally block everything that is uncomfortable. 

My house was a mess? Mentally ignore it. Block it out. Then when my boyfriend would come over, I'd be embarrassed and beat myself up. The minute he left, I would block it again. I wasn't letting my problems actually enter my consciousness. 

So now, my new motto is ""let things bother me, especially when I can do something about them."" If I don't feel like cleaning, I make myself stare at the mess for 30 seconds. Usually then it starts to bother me and I clean it up.

Now, my house is a thousand times cleaner based on that one thing. I don't allow myself to mentally block anything out anymore, and my life is so much better for it. Now it bothers me that my bed didn't get made this morning. Amazing!

I took a long hard look I never the mirror. Instead of beating myself up, I let it bother me that my body isn't where it should be. I am now on a diet, and about to cook a healthy dinner for my boyfriend tonight, in my clean house. 

I let my to do list, instead of subconsciously hanging over my head, I let it truly bother me. It's now finished except a couple of things. 

Y'all. You're not lazy, you're not stupid. Just stop blocking it all out as a coping mechanism. Let it bother you, let it stress you out, and you will make progress.";283;"All of these response posts are bullshit.  Do some long-term fasting and you will automatically fix yourself.

[NeedAdvice] Self discipline in an unstructured environment;t3_8793yb;3;"Hello all. Any/all advice would be helpful.

I'm in a relatively new position (been in my job a little over two months) and I'm having a bit of an issue.

I like the work, but I am in an open office environment and several of my coworkers do not like the work or the workplace and are very vocal about it. They spend as much time as possible not doing work and seeking distractions, usually by bothering others in the office. Most of the management team is off site and so doesn't know how negative the office can get. We also work from home at least once a week, which fuels this general lack of discipline (more than one coworker has bragged to me about how little they do from home and in the same breath complained about not getting more work from home). My boss is very hands off and not in the office super often, so I need to impose my own system to make this work.

I don't want to cause any alienation with my coworkers, but I also have seen my own productivity suffer greatly. How do I create a system of discipline that works at home and in the office? I have a good system for keeping track of my work but actually getting it done has become next to impossible.

Any suggestions?

This is kind of capitalizing on creating a specific study environment but you do it within your computer.

This way when you log in and choose your study account you will be signaling to yourself that it is study time. Little bits like that help act on your subconscious and work to your advantage.

You could also do what I did in college and never do schoolwork at home. Get it all done in the library or on campus or whatever works for you. Obviously youtube is a risk anywhere you go so maybe double down and do both suggestions?

I cant go to sleep I always am thinking about what I need to be doing.

 I just need to get my job done and Ill be fine.";140;"Listen OP, I've been where you've been and worked insane hours like that for long periods of time, and it did permanent damage. I was 19 at the time, still very young, but the stress and the lack of rest can burn out anybody, and it did with me. 

Let me tell you what will happen, if it hasn't already:

- The quality of your work will deteriorate to the point of being useless

- Your ability to concentrate will be shot to hell

- You'll get bouts of insomnia because your body can't rest properly

- Your body will start feeling weak and like it's on the verge of some big bout of flu all the time, because you can't nourish it properly. 

- Potential disordered eating patterns.

I experienced all of the above. Months after quitting, I still struggled with most of them. My original plan was to go back to school after that job but I had to postpone that because I was not healthy enough to be a good student. This is also when I slowly realized that no job is worth this kind of sacrifice. 

Because you know what, you can give it your 200% every single day for years and years and when you finally die of a heart attack or some other preventable cause if you'd listened to your body, your employer will send your family flowers in time for your funeral and THAT'S IT. 

So, let's tackle this in a reasonable manner. 

This project that has to be completed in 17 days, why are you the only one working on it? Do you have colleagues you can enlist the help of? If not, it's time to tell your boss that 17 days is not a realistic timeframe: ""I've been working 16-hour days in order to get this thing done, and despite this I can already tell I won't be able to make this deadline before dying first. Based on my current estimation, I would be able to complete it by approximately X days. Would that work too? If not, I'm going to need some help."" 

ProTip, make your estimation bigger than what you think you need, so you won't be sprinting at the end of the line. And if you complete it faster  anyway, well, no boss would be complaining about that. 

If your boss is intolerant and you HAVE to make it within this timeframe, I would seriously consider quitting. I don't know where you live, but I later learned that what the company was forcing me to do wasn't actually legal at all. Take care of yourself, because no-one else will. 

If you're doing this to get some kind of startup off the ground, please realize that after those 17 days your brain will be jello and your hard work will sink like the Titanic.

Once you reach 25 you start slowing down naturally. Although with the amount of pressure you’re giving your body now, it’s possible that your body would naturally give up earlier than your supposed slow-down time.

Someone close to me did the same routine, around 16 hours of work a day. He ran his own business, ate 2 meals a day at 3pm and 9pm *while* working. No time for exercise or any leisure. The problem with him was that he continued his work until his 50’s, even with dozens of employees under him. He noticed something wrong with his memory recall (similar experiences with u/331845739494) but he didn’t stop until his motor skills started failing. He did a CT scan to discover parts of his brain is undergoing atrophy. It was caused by frequent stress, lack of exercise and food deprivation. Now at 60 his brain is like a 90 year old’s. He doesn’t have much time to live anymore because his brain is shrinking fast and he can’t even form sentences anymore.

People laughed at him because he’s so poor at delegating work. Even with employees he refused to hire people to do operational work. What’s worse is that something happened to his business halfway, lost a large chunk of money but didn’t have the energy and smartness to get it back anymore. Looking at it, it feels like he wasted his life.

When you work for long stretches, you might feel like you’re not stressed. But the moment you push your body beyond it’s limit (ex. Refusing to eat when hungry, not sleeping when tired), you produce so much adrenaline, which is physically causing damage and inflammation to your brain, while still giving you insane amounts of energy. The reason why you can’t sleep at night because your brain is high on adrenaline at this point.

Your insatiable drive is important but please find a way to balance it out with other parts of your life. You may be earning a lot of money into your 30s but you might be flushing all that whenever you get sick or when your body pays for the burnout. You have a long life ahead of you, the least you can do is to not make it miserable.

After this project (if it’s so important and you don’t want to stop): Reassess your work ethic. Do a reset and slowly incorporate a few things into your schedule. Start small like inserting time for eating. Set an alarm for it. Mediate before you sleep to drop your adrenaline. Set an alarm for rest periods. They give you fresh eyes whenever you’re in a rut or if you’re working on an error, which is something critical to the efficiency of a project.";5;0.03571428571428572;[[0.96899209]];[[0.63363729]];-0.9229;0.027000000000000003;0.858;0.11599999999999999;-0.9766;0.10099999999999999;0.764;0.136;-0.054000000000000006;-0.15439393939393942;-0.05215876715876716;-0.10223517223517226

 I just need to get my job done and Ill be fine.";140;"OP, the others are already giving you great advice. Stop and take a step back, you are going to hurt yourself.

But I wanted to touch on the underlying concern that you listed, because I think we may be similar in that regard.

I’m naturally such a weird mix of legitimate workaholic and incredibly lazy/demotivated. Once I have momentum in a project, it’s incredibly hard for me to not spend every moment on it. But, there always comes a time when I must because of life intruding or whatever, and if I stop even for a couple of days that’s when the burnout hits me hard and I can’t get anything accomplished for a while. It makes me feel really ashamed, so I hop back in full force, scolding myself for being a slacker, and the cycle repeats.

However, over time I figured out that a big factor in it is an inability to set reasonable deadlines. I know I have great potential, and don’t like the idea of wasting time or falling into one of those slumps, so I set really aggressive, arbitrary deadlines. I could relax when it’s done, after all.

But keep in mind, that as a goal-oriented person, you will NEVER be done. Sure, you can strong arm your way through quickly coding a game or designing a site at the cost of your health, and you’ll feel really proud for a sec. But what happens next? You’re going to need to market that game, or keep producing content for the site. If it’s successful, it may lead to teaching or speaking opportunities, or a related new business. 

Get what I mean? Unless you plan to finish this project and then let it gather dust, then you need to account for sustainability to reach your full potential.

So, for me at least, I had to acknowledge that deadlines aren’t my strength. I’m bad at setting them properly, and my mental health suffers if I don’t reach them.

After some experimentation, I found I feel better if I have a more “reward”-based system. I have a full mental plan if what needs to be done, but I break my work up into tasks that only take a day or two (a week MAX), don’t have a deadline, and take a pause to appreciate and reward myself for that work once it’s done.

So, for example, instead of saying, “I need to finish this site in a month”, I say “I’m going to work on my About Me page first”.  That’s easy compared to the original goal. Even if I can’t finish it in one day, there’s still tangible, noticeable progress to feel proud of. And once I finish it, I reward myself by either showing my bf or family (I thrive on praise), or take a break and have my favorite restaurant (I love food), etc.

I feel motivated to keep going at that point because of that sense of accomplishment, and because the next small step is clear and easy to see the end of, like “gather info and write staff bios”. Not the scary, vague overwhelming hugeness of “finish the project by X date or you are a failure”. The latter makes me feel stressed and work with a less clear vision, get demotivated and give up if I don’t think I’ll make it, or possibly cut corners on my work to speed things up.

Also, as an aside. People schedule and make time for work and school. They make time for errands and chores. But why is self-care and mental health less prioritized when your brain and your body are your most valuable and irreplaceable tools in life? Treat your body and mind like the assets they are and schedule time to eat, exercise, and yes, even just relax!! 

It took some time to re-program myself, and I’ve had some relapses. But I usually don’t work more than 50 hours per week now. I make time to food prep and exercise, and I play video games or watch a bit of a show every day. Having a more specific direction, and not the ominous ever-looming deadline has improved both my mental health AND the quality of my work. I find that I get more done in those 40-50 quality, productive hours than I ever did in my “all-day, every day” stress. Truly focusing on each step lets me more closely consider whether I’m headed in the wrong direction (for example, in terms of user desires vs my own idea)

Don’t sprint up the mountain so fast that you get lost, or collapse at the top and fall back down. Climb the mountain step-by-step, enjoy a picnic here or there, and revel in your accomplishment and the new destinations you can see standing strong the top. Be excited, not stressed, about the future!";3;0.02142857142857143;[[0.97432735]];[[0.59698723]];-0.9229;0.027000000000000003;0.858;0.11599999999999999;0.9983;0.161;0.784;0.055;-0.195;-0.15439393939393942;0.13438115915250062;-0.28877509854644

For me, it helped to think of it that way.  It empowered me and made me feel like I was choosing this (which I was).  But it put the option to turn back in context also.  It ain't worth breaking down over.  If you go on, do it because you believe you'll succeed.  If you stop believing you'll succeed then don't break for nothing.

I'm pretty good at self-care and preventing myself from being taken advantage of.  I ended up realizing that I was taking on all the pressure for what was, in truth, a movable deadline.  Sure people would be disappointed and there were knock-on consequences, but then everyone suffered a little instead of me taking all of it.

In the brain.  

If you're ""learning"" things you don't really have a use for, you're basically wasting your time and energy .. and notebooks. 

Today's technology doesn't even require you to know things the way people did last century.  Everything from ""making soap from scratch"" to ""advanced electronics repair"" is easily found as a video tutorial.  

The human brain has a great capacity for generalizing.  This is a great feature that allows you to retain the general idea of what you learned without having to be an encyclopedia.  When you need to know specific details for a project just look them up.    If your ""todo"" list got lost and nothing from that list ever came back to remind you it needed doing, then it didn't need doing in the first place.  Tasks like ""take out trash"" or ""fix leaky roof"" will always give a reminder.  Tasks like ""learn Swahili"" because you thought it might be cool but there's not really a use for it in your life... won't.";3;0.33333333333333337;[[0.96401983]];[[0.75904389]];0.8858;0.11699999999999999;0.855;0.027999999999999997;0.8176;0.085;0.8959999999999999;0.02;0.02400000000000001;0.09404761904761906;0.2448717948717949;-0.15082417582417584

I do not accept any excuses that are emotion driven such as laziness or ,, i dont feel like doint it,, bullshit but i do accept the fact that external events, i can not control can blow my routine away.  In order to avoid a full fail devide your day into 4 or more periods: 8-12, 12-15, 15-20  20-24. fill every period with the the goals you want to work on: from 8-12 are 4 hours, i will study for 3 hours and the 1 hours will be the rest between the study cicles.  
Now if you have to deal with and unexpected event just dedicate a full period to it:  you wanted to study but boom, unexpected event at 9am so now you will close your projects for that time period and then start you things in the next period. 
By having your life divided into different areas and your days divided into different periods you will never be able to blow everything away only by having to deal with and external event. 
you  may have to sacrifice 1 or 2 periods of your day but this is still better than being improductive for the rest of the day.

I find I tend to get overwhelmed by the things I need to do to get back on track causing me to delay them. Advice? ";51;"My method of resetting is to assess where I currently stand with the fundamentals:

* Am I eating right?
* Sleeping right?
* Exercising?
* Meditating?
* Journaling?
* Cleaning up after myself?

Depending on how good or bad each of them are, I pick the lowest hanging fruit that I believe is dragging everything else down and focus my efforts on doubling down to get it right over the next few days or weeks to get myself back on track.

Another great thing is to list out all of the tasks you want, need, or could be doing and making a huge ass list of it.

Then you can work to prioritize, eliminate, or delegate them.

Making the list is huge just for the burden it relieves from your mind and ""shoulders""

Also when you make the list, you can just start targeting the easy shit first and this will help you get the ball rolling because when you nail them you'll feel good and you'll want to keep doing it causing you to ladder up to the harder stuff ";2;0.0392156862745098;[[0.89041756]];[[0.68446479]];0.3094;0.057999999999999996;0.8909999999999999;0.051;0.7941;0.133;0.7859999999999999;0.08199999999999999;-0.044000000000000004;0.060119047619047614;0.1594402673350042;-0.09932121971595656

[NeedAdvice] I'm unhappy with my life and want to change, but at the same time I don't, I need help.;t3_83q7a2;7;"Hello Reddit,

I've been struggling with this for quite a while now. I procrastinate a lot, do everything at the last minute, and I'm very careless in my work. I do the strict minimum. I think it's because of a fear of failure? I'm not sure.

I have no ambition or drive whatsoever. I don't know what I'm going to study, or what I want to study. I have no hobby, no passion, aside from distracting myself with video games and excessive internet use.

My mood fluctuates often: for example, I feel fine during the day, laughing at everything in school for example, or playing video games etc, I don't think too much. And in the evening, I start thinking about my lack of discipline and all my other flaws (I struggle with body image issues, loneliness and a bunch of other flaws) and I start feeling bad about my life. Well, it's not like that everyday, but you get what I'm saying: sometimes I feel alright, sometimes meh. I'm confused whether or not I like my life, since it changes everyday lmao. (right now obviously, I feel like shit)


But at the same time, I realize how privileged I am (nice country, not poor, internet access, not starving and shit) and I feel guilty for being all whiny and boohoo poor me while some people are having legit problems, you know?

And, I don't want to change because I have no motivation. I dislike my lifestyle, but not enough so that I want to change it. I feel like I have to hit rock bottom to then start to change. Idk I'm actually very confused and don't know why I feel the way I do or how I change it.

So, what's your advice for me? Why am I like this? How do I find some passion/ambition?";35;"Hey there, Ceanatis! Nice to meet you. I'm a 41 year old guy who spent my entire twenties and the first half of my thirties trying to find answers to the questions you're asking.

Why are we like this? You are fighting resistance, because once upon a time this resistance kept us alive. Our ancestors struggled to find enough calories to eat, and any time your brain could get you not to do something, it would. Don't walk down to the watering hole, until you are really thirsty.

&gt;I dislike my lifestyle, but not enough so that I want to change it.

This is the krux of the problem. I didn't turn my life around until I hit rock bottom. Quite simply, I didn't want it badly enough.

This proved to be linked to my standards. I was a hardcore stoner, college dropout, and spent all of my time playing wow. That was fine, because that's what all my friends did.

We are very much the product of the people we associate with. If you want to change your life, then find the people who are actively pursuing or who already have the success you're after, and see if they'll mentor you. See if you can make some successful friends.

Over time your standards will go up. You will demand more from yourself, because you see other people demanding more from themselves.

I highly recommend reading a book called Mindset by doctor Carol Dweck. It's a short read, and definitely changed the way I saw the world. Most people around you probably have a fixed mindset.

Find the growth mindset people who are out there changing your lives, and start doing what they do. =D";17;0.4857142857142857;[[0.96788095]];[[0.6364248]];-0.8166;0.133;0.711;0.156;0.9940000000000001;0.19;0.769;0.040999999999999995;-0.172;-0.10937142857142858;0.17434865900383142;-0.28372008757526

So, what's your advice for me? Why am I like this? How do I find some passion/ambition?";35;"Whoah, this sounds like me six months ago. I don't know if it'll be helpful to you but I can share my way of dealing with it. 

I was probably mildly depressed for a good four years at least, had no motivation, my social life was falling to pieces. I was basically addicted to youtube, gaming, and social media. I coasted through life never reaching my potential - and I always knew it. I think I was pretty good at hiding my depression, I could still laugh and have a good time, but I was basically empty and withdrew myself as a result. I also worked with my family (don't ever work with family btw) and that started to fall apart too.

The privileged thing really resonates with me too. I had such a good life, nothing external to blame my shit on, just myself essentially. I used to think that my problems were so insignificant compared to others like you as well. But that line of thinking will get you nowhere - and you will likely never properly address the issues. These problems aren't delegitimised just because you feel like you are well off. You have them, now sort through them. Then maybe you can help others.

I had to search deep to find the root causes. I had to address my addicitons, cognitive dissonance, fears, find my true ambitions, and accept responsibility. This shit is hard, it's gonna hurt, there's no way of sugar coating it. But this is adversity - embrace it, work through it and you will breed strength and character.   

One person that really helped me is [Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW_bdx80IIQ) - he's particularly good if you're a young male. He basically tells how to sort your life out and accept responsibility in a very blunt manner. But I find strength through knowledge, you might be different. 

 I sorted out my diet, I ate quite a bit of junk food before. Basically just eat plenty of veges, and drink water and you're pretty good. And get some excersize in, it doesn't have to be anything crazy - but it's proven to improve your mood and might help with body image issues in the long run. I find it easier to excersize when i'm focused on improving mental cognition, with fat burning and muscle development being an added bonus. Diet &amp; excersize might be the root cause to your fluctuating moods, it was for me. 

Another technique I used as an ex-competitive gamer - I used to practice and get really good at micro skills, so I just applied the same concept to life skills. I also deleted my facebook because I wasted too much time on it, although in retrospect deactivating or blocking it would have been a better option - particularly as I'm trying to rebuild my social life. Just something to consider.

After 6 months, these depressive feelings linger, but they are becoming less prominent and don't control me anymore. I searched deep, changed my life path drastically, and I think i'm way better off for it.  Even if my current path doesn't lead me to fulfillment, I now have the ability to healthily evaluate my life and avoid personal toxicity. Hope this helps :)

One last note: You may want to consider seeing a professional, even if it's just to talk things through - it can be very helpful for some people.";5;0.14285714285714288;[[0.97999445]];[[0.77582487]];-0.8166;0.133;0.711;0.156;0.9972;0.21600000000000003;0.674;0.11;-0.129;-0.10937142857142858;0.15169753086419752;-0.2610689594356261

I realise now just how much of my life I’ve wasted with the internet of things that has added no value to my life. 

2) stop procrastinating - no really, just stop. Force yourself to do the things you’re putting off. I was a huge procrastinator and I read so many articles and general things about how to stop, such as identify why you’re putting the thing pff as that will help you understand your blockers and overcome them(which isn’t bad advice), but nothing truly worked until I said , eff this, and just did the thing. Don’t overthink it, just do it. What’s the worst that could happen? Exactly. 

3) start reading more - it sounds like you might be overthinking a lot when your mind isn’t being occupied with just living life. When you get home, perhaps try picking up a book? Fiction books are a great way to get lost in another world and it helps to use your imagination. Non-fiction is great if you’re wanting to learn about something generally. I never read. I went through the Harry Potter phase, but other than that I’ve never really picked up a book and stuck with it. However, I’ve recently made it a personal objective to read a book a month. I download ebooks and read off my phone during my commute to work, easy (i’ve just read book 1 of Star Wars Darth Bane - it’s fantastic if you’re into that stuff).

4) Similar to above - maybe have a look into stoicism philosophy (check out /r/stoicism). I’ve found it really connects with my view on life and has definitely helped me answer a lot of the similar questions you’re asking. Once you’ve got the gist of it and you find it connects to you, I’d recommend reading Moral letters to Lucillius by Seneca.

Final note - you won’t do any of the above if you dont tackle point 2 first. Just make shit happen. All the best ";3;0.08571428571428572;[[0.97387736]];[[0.64831138]];-0.8166;0.133;0.711;0.156;-0.9309;0.113;0.7509999999999999;0.136;1.3877787807814454e-17;-0.10937142857142858;0.063768115942029;-0.1731395445134576
[NeedAdvice] I'm unhappy with my life and want to change, but at the same time I don't, I need help.;t3_83q7a2;7;"Hello Reddit,

I've been struggling with this for quite a while now. I procrastinate a lot, do everything at the last minute, and I'm very careless in my work. I do the strict minimum. I think it's because of a fear of failure? I'm not sure.

I have no ambition or drive whatsoever. I don't know what I'm going to study, or what I want to study. I have no hobby, no passion, aside from distracting myself with video games and excessive internet use.

My mood fluctuates often: for example, I feel fine during the day, laughing at everything in school for example, or playing video games etc, I don't think too much. And in the evening, I start thinking about my lack of discipline and all my other flaws (I struggle with body image issues, loneliness and a bunch of other flaws) and I start feeling bad about my life. Well, it's not like that everyday, but you get what I'm saying: sometimes I feel alright, sometimes meh. I'm confused whether or not I like my life, since it changes everyday lmao. (right now obviously, I feel like shit)


But at the same time, I realize how privileged I am (nice country, not poor, internet access, not starving and shit) and I feel guilty for being all whiny and boohoo poor me while some people are having legit problems, you know?

And, I don't want to change because I have no motivation. I dislike my lifestyle, but not enough so that I want to change it. I feel like I have to hit rock bottom to then start to change. Idk I'm actually very confused and don't know why I feel the way I do or how I change it.

So, what's your advice for me? Why am I like this? How do I find some passion/ambition?";35;"First of all, be nice to yourself!  Then realize that doing things now is basically being nice to yourself.

No one is ever super motivated to do what they should do all the time.

If you are a jiu jitsu fighter your bicep size isn't really that important, but if you want to be a body builder type then it does. Figure out what your purpose for working out truly is, because I want to be healthy is not good enough. When you have that answer you will have the inner discipline to do your workout. When you have that vision you will still have days that you wont want to workout, but you can also say to that inner voice: "" I guess I am okay being an average jiu jitsu fighter or I am okay with being the smaller arm guy at the gym."" because if you skip that is the new vision you will be accepting.

The problem is that you have disingenuous goals. You wan't to be disciplined and do stuff without it feeling like work. That's a consequence of actually wanting something because you WANT it. Not because you feel you should want it. Get the difference? You're acting like your own slave driver with all the critique and demands you have on your work ethic. You allready said you hate it when someone tells you what to do. That includes yourself. See yourself as someone you need to negotiate with. Like, what can I realistically do today that I WOULD do.

Edit: spelling";6;"I’m having some similar issues,  and all of what I’ll share is easier said than done, but I think it may help to hear a different perspective. 

First of all, it’s always okay to ask for help. I think reddit is an awesome place, and for the most part people are pretty helpful. There definitely seems to be some depression rooted into your words, and it can be very crippling to all aspects of your life, so I’ll try to attack it from that angle. 

My Sensei always said, “In a world of uncontrollables, there are certain things you can control”

If you saw a child laying in the middle of the road, and no one else was around, would you go and help it? I’m guessing you would, considering you said you want to help people. If that same child was you, would you help you? Again, you probably would. Think of all of the negative shit you’re saying to yourself...I equate it to pushing the child back down after it tried to get up. So, first thing, stop putting yourself down. It’s counter productive, and you’re trying to be productive. 

The topic of self love cuts to the core of me. My parents divorced when I was 4, and both step-parents despised me. I grew up not feeling wanted most of the time. So I may not understand your thoughts, but I have periods of self loathing and self deprecation as well. I know this may be extremely difficult, but I’d talk to someone you care about and that you know cares about you. Tell them you love them, and hear them say it back. It’s much easier to put up a wall than to let someone in to your innermost feelings aka love. I’d also recommend speaking with a therapist (please don’t take that in a condescending way, I need to as well).

Ahhh, to get shit done. This has been an absolute chore for me for my whole life. I never had a foundation of discipline, and It’s something that needs to be built like a muscle. The more you do, the easier it’ll be to continue to add on more. Again with the controllables, what are you doing to create productivity? Do you have a productive workspace? Is your phone/laptop/tv on when you’re working on a project? Again, stuff I can work on as well. The last bit is, are you trying? Are you putting forth effort? If it’s really difficult, a method that works for me is to take breaks, get some work done and give yourself a reinforcing reward.

First I would simply close this reddit page and actually begin working on a somewhat convoluted program that is due for class in two days.

I tend to sleep often. This is because I am tired when I get back home from college and I also have zero stamina, so I'll go and proceed to take a six hour nap. Then I fuck around on the internet because I'm too scared(?) to start doing any actual work.

Almost failing a math class last quarter even though I really did honestly try very hard to understand how to do simple shit really fucked me up. Also fucked up my GPA. I can't bear to tell my parents I got a 1.0 in that class. I can't and there's nothing they could do about it. I'm too scared to try again and there's a good chance I'll just decide to take precalc when I'm in a uni (I'm in a dual enrollment program) but that's only if I don't off my useless self in senior year. I'm still fairly 50-50 on this. No, I don't have depression, I just want to die.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a doctor. So I could help people? Well the definition I have for ""people"" is pretty fucked and a whole nother topic...but I digress. I wanted to be a doctor to be respected and not have to work a laborous job like my father. I guess you could still say I want to be an ophthalmologist...but it'll take a ridiculous amount of time, not to mention money, to actually become one.

It's not like I could be a doctor anyways. I'm too stupid to be one.

God, I envy seeing all these students go and ace every assignment and test they're ever given. I can't even comprehend how that's possible. They're over there achieving things I struggle with. It's not rocket science.

""Hurr durr you can't judge a fish by it's ability to climb a tree."" Except all human beings are basically identical, but with slight variations so that argument is useless.

I just want to be able to do some fucking work on the fly without feeling like I'm pulling teeth.

I just want to curl up and die. Actually, I don't even want to bother finding a spot to curl up and die in. I just want to stop thinking and feeling spontaneously. I can't even bear to look at my reflection...I hate the fucking nosferatu that stares back at me with lifeless eyes.

I want to be a productive person for myself, but I can't bear to even think of starting any work. I really hate it when someone tells me what to do. It's just the fact of the matter that they're dictating what I can and can't do. I'm not someone's fucking dog.

(Even a dog is more useful than I am. At least people love their dogs.)

I've really just been going off on a tangent here, but what do I do to just start working...and continue working? I hate myself and all my shitty habits like this. I can't even imagine a future for myself that doesn't involve looking down the barrel of a gun. I'm sure some people are born stupid and I'm just one of them. God I'm such a lazy and useless fuck.

This is not that big of a deal. Some of the best apps and book reccomendations I've found have been from Reddit.

If you're using a laptop and not your phone, an easy fix to the internet issue is installing something like BlockSite or StayFocusd. It even redirects to another site as an alternative if you want. I've used this on my home laptop to great success. 

Avoiding reddit and internet on your phone is a lot harder though, but if you have Android, they have apps for that too.

This is trivial. I realized three years into my degree that I did better taking 4 courses at a time then 5, and even then, I could only do well at 3 and struggle on one. Getting a 1.0 in one class is fine, as long as you're above the cutoff line for facing academic probation. Also, not sure what field you are trying to get into, but I assure you unless you're going into grad school, university grades don't matter quite as much as you think. Just get the degree and get out.

&gt; It's not like I could be a doctor anyways. I'm too stupid to be one.

I wanted to be a basketball player, or an athlete, or a biologist. Turns out I wasn't smart enough or gifted enough in either of those three. The beauty of life is that there's literally hundreds of career paths you can take. Also, you seem like you're in the STEM fields and are a bright guy - so stop worrying, there's tons of other areas you can excel at. 

&gt; God, I envy seeing all these students go and ace every assignment and test they're ever given. I can't even comprehend how that's possible. They're over there achieving things I struggle with. It's not rocket science.

They struggle with it as much as you do. Sometimes it comes down to just making the time (or extra time) to study.

&gt; I just want to be able to do some fucking work on the fly without feeling like I'm pulling teeth.

That comes with practice/time though. The more you put into something, the more you get out. Everything worth doing/hard feels like you're pulling teeth when you first start. It gets easier over time because you adapt to it.

&gt; I've really just been going off on a tangent here, but what do I do to just start working...and continue working? I hate myself and all my shitty habits like this. I can't even imagine a future for myself that doesn't involve looking down the barrel of a gun. I'm sure some people are born stupid and I'm just one of them. God I'm such a lazy and useless fuck.

Take solace in that everyone struggles with discipline and doing work in their own ways. You're in school, which already puts you ahead, from a work ethic perspective, over a lot of other students and peers that didn't work as hard as you did to get where you are. 

I think you need to recognize that there is no ""perfect"" study technique, and that not everyone who looks like their acing things is having a grand old easy time while doing so.

Also, recognize that these things are hard. Studying is hard. If it was easy, no one would get bored/disinterested/frustrated by it.

If you're struggling with math, why don't you break down the ways in which you can improve it? Maybe studying with a friend would help? Going to your TA? Making extra time to study for it. 

Its all hard, and I had periods of lethargy during my undergrad as well. But keep in mind that at the end of it, as long as you graduate, that is all thats going to matter. The shit before that is not going to be easy, but it is definitely doable without you having to be perfect.

You can do this.

Thanks in advance!";246;"&gt;play out hypothetical social interactions in my head

I don't know, but I'm only making suggestions:  A psychotic trauma-based reaction?  Give yourself the chance to sit still and totally feel in the moment you are triggered into playing out the social interaction.  See what's there.  Determine why it makes you feel better to daydream that interaction.  

If the daydreaming is in response to a negative behavior from someone, you could be suffering flashbacks.  Maybe the recent behavior wasn't heavy, but that it triggered an inborn related trauma that caused the flashback.  (I have had this problem which is why I bring it up.  In short, I had absolutely no one in my life who ever gave a flying F and I was ""coping"" by daydreaming.  This might not even apply to you.) 

&gt;mind wanders off   

This can be a form of dissociation (trauma-based).  

&gt;How can I stop daydreaming?

Find the trigger or stressor.  Or perhaps it is the location?  Where do you do this most?  Avoid those places and see what happens.  

Good luck!

edit:  I looked up this Gary guy.  I've listened to him before.  He had good solid principles but his underlying tone can be harsh.  One *might* be able to conclude that an individual who is motivated by his tone is one who has been abused.  

Motivation doesn't require abuse, imo.  For many it is helpful and harmless.  Again, I'm still focusing on individual psychology.

[NeedAdvice] How to get confidence if language processing disorder is holding me back?;t3_87yfsc;4;"Hello. I am not sure if this is a right place to ask question about discipline but I'll ask anyway.

NOTE: I apologize for the writing I made.  It takes me time to think about what to write on this post.

What is the problem?:
I am about to be in the age 30s.  English is my native language, and I was diagnosed with language processing disorder when I was a child.  This affects me not only in schoolwork, learning, job, but also in everyday life.  

For example, I have trouble listening and remembering what people say/discuss even though I take notes.  This happens in classroom, discussions, talking to people.  I do lose concentration even though I just stare at people and do nothing.  I have to use recorders for conversion and call recorders on the phone and rewind to make sure I understand.  

I also have trouble reading/writing/speaking efficiently. 


A lot of people advice me not to be afraid and go talk and network people.  That is true.  
The small talk is fine because I can repeating it over again and again.  But most of the time, I need to give myself time to think about what should I say even though if it's my therapist talking to me.  Same thing as asking for help.  If I want to have people trying to understand exactly what my problem is, I have to use somebody's writing on websites like reddit, quora, etc because I am not able to write what others do.  I also ask a friend/family to help me enough to another person.  

Right now, if I want to learn something, there are times that I watch videos and rewind them back.  I'm just not a classroom person as I do get bored and exhausted when a lecturer talks more than 30 minutes.

I am healthy, and I do get enough sleep.  I am not able to find a therapy/pathologist that specialize the speech around my area.  Most of it is all about depression/ social anxiety/ family issues etc.
  
What is your question?:
I understand that you need confidence when it comes to talking to people, but what about me?  I cannot keep repeating this over and over again, or  should I just accept my weakness even though it is critical for the lifetime? 

Again, I'm sorry about my writing. ";7;"I think accept it as it is. 
But try new ways, for example write down an outline of things you want to talk about and even if you want to go on date put it in front of yourself. I am sure the other person if is aware of your situation will understand.
I don’t know if you can improve your situation or not but I used to listen to famous speeches and repeat them in front of mirrors.
If you can talk about things that you are emotionally attached to then go for them. Like best holidays you had or something like this.
Try singing, it might help.
My suggestions may seem awkward but I think you have to try all the possibilities out there.
I know someone who was mute and tried an unknown yet very simple treatment and got his voice back.
So you can definitely solve the issue. Just be open to new things and don’t get discouraged. ";3;0.42857142857142855;[[0.97187124]];[[0.65987156]];0.2467;0.091;0.821;0.08800000000000001;0.9746;0.18;0.79;0.03;-0.147;0.01798029556650246;0.10281144781144777;-0.08483115224494532

Again, I'm sorry about my writing. ";7;"If you want to help other people understand that commination is very difficult for you, and you occasionally make small mistakes, just mention you have a language processing disorder like you did here. It helps when you explain it. But you don't have to apologize for it. It's not something you can change a lot about. It's part of you, so eventually accepting it would be a lot easier on yourself. And you should be proud that you're working this hard at it!

Would you want to have a therapist that is specialized in language processing disorders? Maybe you can find one who is willing to Skype with you?

For what it's worth, I found what you wrote easy to understand, and it was written in a logical order.

I think initial confidence often comes from something you are good at, not from something you have trouble with. So. What are you good at? What do you like to do that comes easy?

I know it's hard to build confidence when you feel like something is working against you, more so when it's a skill you have to use for so many things in life, but it's definitely possible. 

If you are worried about what others think, know that something that seems strange at first, very quickly becomes normal. People get used to things quickly.

For example when someone is in a wheelchair, at first people will stare and may be uncomfortable and not sure how to act. But then when they get to know the person it becomes normal. They are so used to the wheelchair, and expect that person to be in a wheelchair when they see them, that they don't pay attention to it anymore. It would only be weird if he would suddenly be walking!

This is just your way of communicating. Let other people get used to it, the more you talk with them, the more it will become what's normal. Make them be comfortable with it. Let them get to know you just the way you are. ""Flaws"" and all.

Stress is fear-anger flight-fight mode.  Control the very stress response itself.  Meditation / breathing exercises is tossed around a lot for this very reason, because it levels up **Keep Calm** which winds down the stress system.

And of course, Calm and Confidence are bunk mates.

Aside from meditation, I would also recommend learning more about stress itself.  How fear-anger flight-fight mode works exactly.

[NeedAdvice] Need help - I am trying to build a routine at work (software engineering);t3_83dwt6;2;"Thanks to this subreddit, I built a morning routine that starts at 5:00 AM. My routine is like this:

* 5:00 ~ 5:30 - cold shower, make coffee 
* 5:30 ~ 6:00 - meditatation
* 6:00 ~ 7:00 - read technical papers &amp; brainstorm ideas
* 7:00 ~ 8:00 - study (math, machine learning etc.)
* 8:00 ~ 10:00 - have breakfast, ride bike to work (about 15km)

At work, try to work in short focused bursts (depending on what works best for you!), this could mean ""short"" bursts of 1 hour or 20 to 30 minutes

Then when that time is up, get up and go for a quick physical break/walk around/pushups etc to reset yourself for the next focused burst.

You can also do it so when you've been working for like 2-3 hours of focus, take a bit of a longer break by talking to a colleague, going for a walk around the block, meditating, or some other thing. 

We all need these extended breaks to really be able to focus and provide the best output possible. It's hard to expect 6-7 hours of crazy amounts of focus each day unless you've built up to that over the years/able to get into flow easily

Also try to stack your heavier/harder/important work in the front part of the day, with the more less taxing and dead-mind work later in the day";3;0.2;[[0.95231578]];[[0.69209926]];0.8478;0.098;0.853;0.049;0.937;0.121;0.8220000000000001;0.057;-0.015;0.045695970695970714;0.11177536231884057;-0.06607939162286988

After an hour, I conveniently went to the bathroom for an hour just browsing on my phone on the premise of ""freshening up."" Then I started my work and here's the thing. My parents frequently check in on me to make sure I'm doing work so I actually wasted about 3 hours playing roblox. I don't even like roblox, it's just that it's easy for me to alt + f4 and it instantly closes whereas in high demanding games, if I alt + f4, it takes like 15-20 sec to fully close and to open my room door takes like 5 sec (I have it setup so that you can only turn the doorknob to the left to open it so there's a chance that my parents open it to the right, giving me more time to close out of whatever I'm doing). So I bullshit 3 hours playing roblox and when my parents check on me, I alt + f4 and boom, my one sentence for my English paper shows up. My mom was none the wiser and she just says ""your such a hard worker sweetie."" I honestly hate that so much, I kinda wish I could let my parents know that I've been bullshitting through life for 4 years. That's besides the point though, back to the story. Then I was like fuck this, I gotta do my work. Then my brain decides to get horny and I go on a masturbating spree, jerked off for a total of 6 times in the span of 3 more hours. So now I'm at about 4 p.m. And I was like fuck, gotta do my work for real. Then my dad called me over and made me take the snow off his car for another hour. I now have exactly 5 hours to get all my work done. Sounds good right? well, no. My parents go out to get groceries so now U brain tells me it's time to go on a real gaming spree and they don't come back until 7 so now I have 3 hours to do my work. I was like oh fuck, better do some work and started my math HW but then my parents called me over for dinner. Whenever I eat, I always watch a YouTube video. After I eat, my brain decides it's time to binge watch gaming videos. And before you know it, it's 8 pm. With 2 hours to go, I do my history notes that I did not start last week when my teacher assigned it. This takes up the entirety of those 2 hours. I then say ""fuck it, I'll do it as school."" And here I am, at 11:00 pm, wondering why the FUCK I'm like this. Holy shit I could've gotten all this work done last week but nope, had to save it for the very last minute of the very last hour of the very last day in which I didn't even finish a quarter of all the shit I had to do. Because of my procrastination, I've fallen into the three hells of modern teen life: video game addiction, porn addiction, and junk food addiction. I see my friends do their work like a week ahead of time and just breeze through school while I sit here like a piece of shit waiting for the clock to countdown doing useless shit. Any help would be gladly appreciated. 

TL;DR shitty snow day where I had work to do but I instead played videogames and jacked off for close to 12 hours. I've had this lifestyle since I was 12 (around 4 years).";7;"Okay you are really ahead on this because you are young and know you're addicted. Good.

Now let's realize that once you're addicted, you are not in control anymore. Your brain demands dopamine and you oblige. Video games, porn, junk food. Repeat. You have to replace this cycle and it is really hard to do. One of them will most likely trigger the others and your brain will always come up with reasons why you should do them. Exercise, meditation, friends, being honest with your parents or friends, starting a creative hobby, learning a new skill. These are just some of the things that will feel equally good as your addictions if you just give them time. Find things that you actually want to do.

You need to have a good plan that shows what you want and how to achieve it. Start small. Do better than yesterday. Try dropping one of your addictions for a day. Create a step-by-step plan. Try saying ""I will not do any of these things from 8 am to 3 pm"". Anything that you think might work. Replace habits. When you feel like watching porn, immediately do push ups. When you feel like playing video games, read a book. Again, find things that you can always say you want to be doing and force yourself to do them. Recognize the situations and places that trigger your addictions and avoid them.

Motivation. Plan. Action. I know you want to start this tomorrow morning, but you won't. You can only start it now or not start it at all. Do a couple of push ups. Take a cold shower. It feels horrible to just think about starting it now and that's why you need to do it. Take action right now. Leaving the pain for later means you are a coward and will do anything to avoid it tomorrow too. You are not a coward and you know it, it's time to admit it.

If you can be at least somewhat honest with someone about what you are trying to do, do it. Social pressure is even greater than your addictions. You don't have to tell anyone you are addicted to porn, but consider starting a challenge with a friend so that you have outside motivation to exercise or read or whatever.

I've been in similar cycles as you are right now. I'm still working myself out of some of them. You can do this. Remember that if you don't do it, you are hurting everyone around you. This is not about you. By being better, you make everything around you better. Not starting this process would be idiotic and evil. I'm talking to myself as much as I'm talking to you. We can both do this.";7;1.0;[[0.9739593]];[[0.62896735]];-0.868;0.12;0.7559999999999999;0.124;0.3299;0.11199999999999999;0.8079999999999999;0.08;-0.036000000000000004;0.005571428571428568;0.07153151726322457;-0.06596008869179601

2)  Now, super-impose that over me, so that I have your full attention.  Assign me an accent, too.  British, French, Russian...  Southern drawl?  That last one's my favorite, but you pick which one.

3)  See imaginary couch.  It's leather.  Sit, relax cause we gotta be both comfortable cause this is gonna take a while.

I'll admit it.  I need practice dealing with brains too full of excitement tags.  Sorry, bit confusing there.  But hell... your post is confusing, OP.

Just look at it.  Your brain is like full of mexican jumping beans.  Damn, I envy you your youth.  Yes, someone older (and sexy) is paying attention to you.

Let's calm you down, so you can stop stuffing limited brain attic with too much excitement and stress tags.  Wtf are those, you are thinking.

Our brains not only have to store memory of facts, theories, words, figures but also feelings.  The biggest space takers are stress (fear-anger) tags and excitement (lookie! it's a resource! must get!) tags.

Stress (fear-anger), procrastination involves our flight-fight response.  It's for enemies.  We either runaway or fight them.

Excitement is our rewards system.  It's suppose to be for resources, stuff we should be getting because they are resources.

Thing is... you repeatedly tagged work and school as an enemy, cause you kept on stressing (activating your flight-fear mode) over them.  That's why you keep on running away.  And because the fear-anger tags are heavy and sticky.... and adds up - well, shit - your brain fucking turned work and school into world bosses.

Then, you also got way too many excitement tags on video games, porn and junk food.

Your poor inner animal, the primitive reptilian section of your brain keeps running away from enemies (work, school) and seeking sanctuary in your addictions.  Ah shit...  my family rescues too many stray cats so yeah... you're like a lost kitten to me.  (Yes, I'm older, sexy and an animal-lover.)

Come over here.  You need a hug.

Relax.  You are so young.  You can fix this.  First, you gotta rescue your inner pokemon, k?  Your inner animal is really like an animal.  Don't treat it like a dumb human.  Treat it like a dumb animal in need of a lot of understanding.  Be patient with it.  Be patient with yourself.

Work and school are not enemies.  Remember this, stay calm.  Whenever you feel panic, imagine a frightened animal.  That's you.  Pause.  Check your breathing.  It's gonna be unstable.

Now, keep your attention on your breathing.  Change it.  Make it deep, long, slow.  Keep at it.  Until you are calm.

When we are calm, our flight-fight system is under our control.  No fear, no anger.  Just school and work.  Also, when we are calm - the addictions are not as addicting.

If you keep on staying calm, slowly your brain will remove those fear-anger-excitement tags.  It will free up brain space.  So, your inner animal also feels less suffocated.  So, it can relax easier.  And so can you.

I just gave you meditation in a nutshell.  That's what it is for.  Keeping ourselves calm.  Now, it would also be a really good idea for you to (calmly) tell your parents that you've got a lot of difficulties, OK?

Ask them for help.  Keep yourself calm.  OK?";2;0.28571428571428575;[[0.9658348]];[[0.48840251]];-0.868;0.12;0.7559999999999999;0.124;0.9791;0.19;0.6559999999999999;0.154;-0.040000000000000015;0.005571428571428568;0.08796072101156847;-0.0823892924401399

just sell it.

talk to your dad and pray to  him for help.
pray 4 times a day minimum - morning , afternoon , evening , night.

first try to get off your computer by selling it.

do not try to do work at all .

take a leave from school for 7 days to clean your schedule.

now - just sleep , eat well m go outside to some nature place - like a tree.
trees, mountains , nature are already sorted out - if you go near them - you will feel sorted out.

just close your eyes , lie down , fly a kite or something .

choose passtimes other than your fuckin computer.

like playing a sport , gym 

all this will relax your brain .

do more to relax your brain - soak your feet in warm water .

play with simple toys . 

do not touch yourself . no sex / fap and no computer .

spend a week like this 

you should be fine then - do report back.

[NeedAdvice] Stay disciplined with an girlfriend;t3_81grbd;11;"Hey,
I started getting more disciplined about 1 year ago and was studying about 10 hours each day. I always got up at 5am, started meditating and working out, and then started studying. I was able to do enough for uni and also learn to draw and play guitar.

I've been in a relationship for 5 months now and I really love her, but I'm struggling to stay disciplined. She wants to be with me 24/7 and it's hard for me to focus on things I want to do if she's around because I'm always distracted. I'm always trying to encourage her to do something like learning an instrument or learn how to draw or get more disciplined in general because she hasn't got any interests but it just feels like she really doesn't want to do anything besides being with me. 

Now I'm getting more and more depressed because I really love her, but I'm just losing way too much time and I don't really know what to do anymore because it's just not possible to talk to her about such things. The only thing I do now is work out sometimes and study maybe 2 hours a day. Compared to how it was half a year ago that's just depressing to me..

Thanks for your advice

In my case, she was a bit immature, which manifested itself into other interpersonal problems other than the one at hand.

If she can't respect that you have ambition, a career and interests then it probably won't work out in the long haul.

[NeedAdvice] Stay disciplined with an girlfriend;t3_81grbd;11;"Hey,
I started getting more disciplined about 1 year ago and was studying about 10 hours each day. I always got up at 5am, started meditating and working out, and then started studying. I was able to do enough for uni and also learn to draw and play guitar.

I've been in a relationship for 5 months now and I really love her, but I'm struggling to stay disciplined. She wants to be with me 24/7 and it's hard for me to focus on things I want to do if she's around because I'm always distracted. I'm always trying to encourage her to do something like learning an instrument or learn how to draw or get more disciplined in general because she hasn't got any interests but it just feels like she really doesn't want to do anything besides being with me. 

Now I'm getting more and more depressed because I really love her, but I'm just losing way too much time and I don't really know what to do anymore because it's just not possible to talk to her about such things. The only thing I do now is work out sometimes and study maybe 2 hours a day. Compared to how it was half a year ago that's just depressing to me..

You've gone from being single to in a relationship during that time and it's understandable that your routine was thrown out while you get to know each other, etc., so don't be too hard on yourself. It's going to be a lot harder to get back to your old routine because you have a relationship, which takes time and effort to maintain.

Try setting aside time to focus on yourself and your study where you can't be disturbed, but also make sure you spend time with her afterwards. You likely won't have as much time as before, but as long as you're working towards your goals, that's a good thing. 

Personally, I wouldn't worry about trying to change another person beyond gentle encouragement (which you've done). Let her find something else to do on her own while you're studying, and she could look forward to the time you spend together.

[NeedAdvice] I have too much free time when I live a more disciplined life. I don’t know what to do with it.;t3_80shqn;4;"I’m a senior in high school. I’ve been very into self improvement and self discipline for about 6 months now.


Current things I’m doing to be more disciplined:

1. Getting to bed early, between 9-10. I have a nightly routine when brushing my teeth and washing my face that gets me ready for bed. 

2. Wake up around 4:30-5:00 and going to the gym. Not an every day thing, but at least 4 days a week.

3. Eating healthy. I barely ever eat “junk” food like chips or sweets. I don’t drink soda. Drinking at least a gallon of water a day. Getting the right amounts fruits/veggies/meats. Don’t smoke anything/do drugs. I drink with friends once or twice a month but it’s never a problem.

4. I’ve read a couple self help books, but not a huge reader so I’ve procrastinated on starting another.

5. Keep my room &amp; car clean and orderly. Try to stay organized wherever possible. Helping around the house when needed.

6. Don’t play video games.


Things I need to work on:

1. Doing school work the night it’s assigned. Our homework is due two days after it is assigned so I generally put it off until the night before it’s due. But, because it’s senior year, I barely have homework. It’s not that much of a burden, I’m almost never in a crunch for time to finish it all. I’m somewhat gifted and school has never been that challenging for me, allowing me to not have to focus on it that much. Putting it off doesn’t necessarily cause me any problems, i just know it’s forming procrastination habits.

2. Far far too much social media. Snapchat, instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and texting. I don’t spend my whole days on them, I control myself when I’m around people. But first thing in the morning, I check my apps. Anytime I’m laying around with free time, using them. Before I go to bed, using them. I have a ton of free time and they bring about enjoyment without any effort. I’m addicted to them but don’t want to get away from them.

3. I don’t have a job, resulting in much more free time. In 3 months I’ll be leaving to spend a month or so in Europe and my excuse to not get a job is I don’t want to work somewhere and have to quit right after joining. I feel like I have absolutely no qualms about working/having a job, I always find an excuse not to have one. I also feel like I need one. 

4. I want to start reading more but have horrible attention span, I believe due to constant use of my phone and the apps on it.

5. Procrastination in general. I have periods of greatness, where I barely do it, and other times that are not so good, where I procrastinate with everything. I want to work on keeping the procrastination to a minimum. It’s hasn’t burned me yet but I feel it definitely will soon.

6. I’ve found I’m fantastic at making excuses.

My biggest problem, however, is trying to figure out what to do with my free time. I quit soccer this year and I’m not playing in college. I don’t have the desire to go train hard for something I’m done with. Also, I live like 30 minutes from my nearest friend and would almost always have to play alone. I usually enjoy writing, I have no problem with essays at school, but I’ve tried journaling, writing music, writing a book, and other things of that nature and just don’t find that same joy in it. It feels like I’m forcing myself too hard. I’ve tried to get into making music, but I just wasn’t born talented enough to do that. No biggie. I’m a huge photography fan but am not sure where to start with that hobby. I don’t want to go out alone and take pictures, and my camera isn’t that great. I’ve wanted to make YouTube videos for the longest time but have no creative ideas to make them about. I think computers are really cool but don’t have that much of a passion to learn about them. I spent a month or so intensively learning excel but afterwards, I’m not as interested in it as I thought I was. I don’t have much extra money for new hobbies. That’s almost everything that interests me. i just feel stuck, and I’m not sure what to try next and where to go from here.

5. Keep my room &amp; car clean and orderly. Try to stay organized wherever possible. Helping around the house when needed.

6. Don’t play video games.


Things I need to work on:

1. Doing school work the night it’s assigned. Our homework is due two days after it is assigned so I generally put it off until the night before it’s due. But, because it’s senior year, I barely have homework. It’s not that much of a burden, I’m almost never in a crunch for time to finish it all. I’m somewhat gifted and school has never been that challenging for me, allowing me to not have to focus on it that much. Putting it off doesn’t necessarily cause me any problems, i just know it’s forming procrastination habits.

2. Far far too much social media. Snapchat, instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and texting. I don’t spend my whole days on them, I control myself when I’m around people. But first thing in the morning, I check my apps. Anytime I’m laying around with free time, using them. Before I go to bed, using them. I have a ton of free time and they bring about enjoyment without any effort. I’m addicted to them but don’t want to get away from them.

3. I don’t have a job, resulting in much more free time. In 3 months I’ll be leaving to spend a month or so in Europe and my excuse to not get a job is I don’t want to work somewhere and have to quit right after joining. I feel like I have absolutely no qualms about working/having a job, I always find an excuse not to have one. I also feel like I need one. 

4. I want to start reading more but have horrible attention span, I believe due to constant use of my phone and the apps on it.

5. Procrastination in general. I have periods of greatness, where I barely do it, and other times that are not so good, where I procrastinate with everything. I want to work on keeping the procrastination to a minimum. It’s hasn’t burned me yet but I feel it definitely will soon.

6. I’ve found I’m fantastic at making excuses.

My biggest problem, however, is trying to figure out what to do with my free time. I quit soccer this year and I’m not playing in college. I don’t have the desire to go train hard for something I’m done with. Also, I live like 30 minutes from my nearest friend and would almost always have to play alone. I usually enjoy writing, I have no problem with essays at school, but I’ve tried journaling, writing music, writing a book, and other things of that nature and just don’t find that same joy in it. It feels like I’m forcing myself too hard. I’ve tried to get into making music, but I just wasn’t born talented enough to do that. No biggie. I’m a huge photography fan but am not sure where to start with that hobby. I don’t want to go out alone and take pictures, and my camera isn’t that great. I’ve wanted to make YouTube videos for the longest time but have no creative ideas to make them about. I think computers are really cool but don’t have that much of a passion to learn about them. I spent a month or so intensively learning excel but afterwards, I’m not as interested in it as I thought I was. I don’t have much extra money for new hobbies. That’s almost everything that interests me. i just feel stuck, and I’m not sure what to try next and where to go from here. 

If anybody has any advice on getting out of this rut, it would be greatly appreciated. ";2;"Dude, you have a marvellous opportunity in front of you. You've declared so many things that you would like to do, and you've made an excuse to not do any of them. 

Discipline is a tool. You have spent the time creating this marvellous tool for yourself, and you've left it to sit around and do nothing. You've spent time honing it, and maybe it's time to really use it. 

Pick one of those things you mentioned, literally just start with one of them, and sink your teeth into it. Practice commitment. Tell yourself, I am going to sink ""x"" amount of time into this every day for a month/week/etc. It might suck, it might not. Try it out and see what happens. 

This freedom you have right now is extremely rare, and I think the most productive thing you can do with it is use it to explore yourself. Do that and you will thank yourself later.

Productivity is about bringing us closer to our goals, to the person we want to be. First you have to figure out what that means to you. Maybe think about how you want to be, live or feel. Then figure out concrete actions that will bring you closer to that. 

If you have concrete steps you want to take because you care about the outcome and then still never do it, then you have a procrastination problem and that's a different beast entirely. 

If you just want to be busy for the sake of being busy, make a list if ideas and try to do one thing a day.

I have enough energy to do so much in my days, but I just can't bring myself to do anything Important or Urgent. I looked through the entire subreddit wiki, but couldn't find a solid push. 

I have life goals, I want to work hard, I know what I want to do - listed out and re-evaluated and attempted to schedule it daily, but I keep getting so into tasks and going over on time... Except the tasks I get into aren't productive (just instant gratification).

Things I need to fix but can't find time for:
I sleep average 2hrs/week-night, 14hrs/weekend-night
Typically eat once per day... sometimes. Sometimes 2, rarely 4
Don't exercise, but walk a lot
Used to use X method exercise, made it 10 days max but many holes and died off
Spend most of my time trying to do schoolwork, but end up procrastinating because I just don't want to work anymore
Meditate and plan for at least an hour every weekday
Denying my addiction to Adderall, which I take 60mg twice weekly

I can provide more info if needed.";57;"Another vote for focusing on fixing your sleep issues. Have you ever thought about talking to a doctor about depression or another mood disorder? People usually think of it as starting with the mental/emotional symptoms that then cause the physical symptoms (i.e., I’m sad and anxious so I can’t sleep or eat), but the first indication I wish I would’ve picked up on is that I’ve been a “bad sleeper” since I was a kid and that’s the driver for my worst symptoms (i.e., I can’t sleep because of brain mumbo jumbo so the worst mood stuff comes from that). Sleep issues, appetite issues, self medication/addiction, lack of motivation, and difficulties with time management are all symptoms of depression and/or other mood disorders so especially if this feels like a change from a past state, I’d recommend talking to your doctor if you can. In my experience, it definitely won’t fix everything and it will only get you back to a level playing field in terms of motivation and discipline, but it’s definitely worth thinking about. Especially with the sleep issue that is pretty far beyond what any adult should even be able to force themselves to survive on (most people I know are worthless without their full 7-8 hours; I’ve got pretty bad sleep issues and consistently getting less than 4 hours kills me), it seems like there might be something going on there. 

Of course I’m not a doctor so take all of this with a grain of salt, just see a lot of similarities in what you’ve described and how I thought I “deserved” to live my life before I got help. Wish you all the best, and hope you can figure something out quickly because wow it sucks to feel like you’re always chasing unattainable goals and sacrificing yourself for it!";1;0.017543859649122806;[[0.96751823]];[[0.61915589]];0.848;0.095;0.85;0.055;0.9647;0.17800000000000002;0.696;0.126;-0.01199999999999999;0.12958553791887126;-0.05142332415059687;0.18100886206946806

Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my native language.";5;"I don't think it's a good long term solution.  Sometimes getting angry at your problem is a good thing.  Sometimes you just need to get angry at being and debt to get out there and get a second job to help pay it off.  Sometimes you need to be sick and tired enough of being sick and tired that you go for a run and start to eat salads.

Long term though I think it can be destructive.  I don't want to be angry all the time.  If you can't be happy with where you are you'll never be happy.  If you have a good job but want better I don't want to have to start to be angry at my job.  That will make the time I spend there bad for no reason.  I don't want to hate my body because that's how people do unreasonable things to themselves when they already have a body better than most.

Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my native language.";5;"You don't get to turn your negative emotions into anger. Sorry.

Anger is one way that we handle stress. It can prompt action, but it relies on that stress being there. Stress is a funny emotion because it's something that we can instigate ourselves.  We can cause stress, so we can cause ourselves to get angry (more easily than we can force ourselves to be sad or happy.)

Anger can cause you to do things that relieve that stress one way or another, and you can get tired of being angry.  But getting tired of being angry doesn't relieve stress.

So you have these other emotional affects, you can work yourself up into being angry and maybe accomplish things by overpowering those feelings with stress and anger.  But eventually you'll get tired of being angry, that stress isn't real, and you'll feel disappointed that you couldn't keep up with it.  Otherwise you will have to delude yourself into actually finding something real to fuel your anger, whether that be hating yourself, hating someone else, fearing something that isn't worth fearing, or whatever to make you stay angry, as it demands more and more to keep you from just wearing that anger out. 

This is a harmful and unhealthy way to live, moreso than lacking motivation. You can more easily hurt yourself or others and lose yourself. 

No, you need to stop and do the following.  Ask if you're sleeping properly.  Ask if you're eating properly.  Correct those things first if your'e not.  Try blue-light blocking glasses and 3mg of melatonin after dinner if you end up spending too much time in front of the screen before bed.  Go to bed before 10PM.  If you have school work to do, work on it in the morning, or work on it before 10PM.  If you procrastinate and this keeps you up, then you'll have to move your procrastination to the morning, you will just not have time to put it off. 

Next ask yourself the big questions.  What are your goals?  Find the smallest goal you can, and find the smallest way to try to achieve that, and then take the smallest step towards that possible. 

Use anger to help you if you come across it, but don't seek it out.  Anger can be a helpful friend when you're in trouble, but if you seek out anger, you are putting yourself in trouble just to ask for help out of it. It won't get rid of those other feelings. 

What will get rid of those other feelings is being healthy.  Being properly rested, doing things that improve your situation. 

And then there is medicine.  You might have a problem with the balance of your neurotransmitters that doesn't go away through anything you or anyone can say or do.  In this case you might benefit from medicine.  Talk to a doctor.  In fact, it's probably worthwhile to talk to a doctor if you can right now, but maybe start by asking about how you can help fix your sleep if that's a problem, or low energy levels, if you're uncomfortable about diving right into the depression self-diagnosis.

Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my native language.";5;"I have been troubled, in different degrees, for the past few years. Early this year was the worst, I contemplated and planned my suicide. Religion and meditation helped me a lot. Now, I am in a much better position than before, self-discipline wise. I am back in a comfortable self-employed position, I am doing a distance degree on my own, and I am still actively improving in my artistic specialty. In fact, I am more artistically and socially confident than before, even aggressive. I choose to be isolated, although I can interact normally with people if work compels me to do so. 
In fact my faith has come to a point when I am not afraid of dying, or of my family members dying, because I know that the afterlife is better. Because this life is temporary anyway, I want to get the most out of it and reach the limits. I don't consider myself actively suicidal. I have faith mixed with a lot of bitterness. It's a thin line.  
I have not gone for therapy for the issues, and I may do so in the future. For now, I do sometimes experience rage at the smallest things, but I learn to function. Sometimes I give myself time to cry and despair, but then I stand back up again. I accept all these sufferings. 
A moment's folly, and fate, caused me to leave my job and my country. I came back completely destroyed, at the bottom of the pit. From there, the only way is up. And up I went, higher than before. The change has been visible to those around me. Little things like really focusing on my education, work, looking up for future career opportunities, waking up early, meditating everyday, eliminating frivolous socializing and shopping etc. They add up.
These experiences are painful, but I am grateful for them. No regrets. I learned to find grace in everything.
For now I am still learning to tame my anger, as it bubbles just right under the surface. Sometimes I feel it eating away at me. 
It CAN be turned into motivations, but at a steep price. Then again, there have been studies showing a link between deep trauma and life success.

I want time to pass by and just get the day over with, so I go play some stuff, go read some articles on Reddit or other things.

I'm just worried about my future. I'm worried if this TERRIBLE (in terms of grades) year will impact my high school records, and I don't even think I have high school planned out! People from the high school came to talk, but I was confused about the resume, the profiles and whatever which made me even MORE worried.

I love chemistry, it all started from studying psychoactive substances. I even got some chemistry notes off of khan academy but regardless, I'm still worried. I'm worried if skills in a subject won't matter without grades, and only your grades will represent your skills.

The end of the school year is coming close. I don't know if I have a good plan for high school, the person from the high school said she would help and fill out a form for me since I was confused. Worried if one bad year will greatly impact the rest. Worried if I won't succeed. Worried if I won't be who I want to be.";8;"First off I would suggest to take a deep breath, calm down, and let's break down the situation together! 

I'm not sure how the education system works where you are from, but at least here in Texas if you are going to a public school, as long as you pass your classes you will be perfectly fine going from middle school to high school. GPA in terms of courses for when you begin to apply to university/college are only taken from high school, not middle school, so don't freak out! Use this as a lesson for the future to build good study habits so that high school, university, etc. will be easier in the future!

 It seems from your description that you are indeed a good student, and the 1-2 week trip would probably be a cause of the bad grades. Missing that much time will definitely make things difficult, I won't sugar coat it, but it is definitely doable! Your teachers are there to assist you, and if they have office hours (time after/before school for extra help on lesson material) definitely take advantage of that! If there isn't a designated time, then take the initiative yourself and ask them for help and see if you can set up a time for extra assistance. If that doesn't work, then ask your classmates! There is absolutely no shame in asking for help, so don't be afraid to do so!

I'm glad to see you enjoy chemistry so much! I actually graduated with a Bachelors degree in chemistry, so I'm right there with you! Trust me, even though grades are important and you should do your best, job experience will be much more important. I won't go to in depth about that, but just know if you truly love the field, you will be fine!

Finally, take up that offer from the person from the high school. Whether that person is a staff member at the school or simply a student, like I said before: Don't be afraid to ask for help! Let me say this to finish off: 1 year is such a short period of our total lives. I had a rough 1 year in university that pushed back my graduation date, but I learned from the experience, graduated, and now have a job offer in the field that I love. Take a deep breath, calm down, and hopefully this helped you out!

Hopefully you read it all.

By the end of high school, you'll realize how little your middle school grades mattered. Don't stress, you have A LOT of opportunity ahead of you to straighten out.

Right now you might feel like you're behind other students because you're not doing well in classes but this really is not the case. Grades are important and you should always work to get as good of grades as you possibly can but the purpose of school is a lot deeper than a letter and a percentage. To me, you seem to actually be *ahead* of your peers which sounds strange but let me explain.

The two things that stand out to me about your post are that 1) you are concerned about your future and 2) that you have an interest in a school topic that extends beyond your classroom. It is very important to consider how your actions affect your future. This is a skill that a lot of people don't develop for a while and because they lack the ability, they fall behind their peers who are working with larger goals in mind. That being said, don't let the future stress you too much. High school in general is a very stressful time and it doesn't help that a lot of parents and teachers and counselors and peers try to tell you that getting into the best possible college is the only thing that matters in the world. It certainly is important but make sure your mental health and your relationships with friends and family are also priorities. You should be taking a little of this and a little of that when it comes to balancing working towards your future and working towards being happy. The earlier you start thinking about both, the better off you'll be.

Your interest in chemistry is a wonderful thing. A lot of high school students just go through the motions of high school and don't really develop any passions. It seemed like most kids have two lives: in school and out of school. This is completely normal and there's nothing wrong with it but if you have something that spans both - like chemistry for you - you have a huge advantage. Having an interest in a subject that extends beyond your schoolwork will allow you to actually want to work and study and that's really the secret to both getting good grades and truly learning the material.

When I was in middle school, we had an accelerated program for the kids who did better in school. Most of the kids from my high school that ended up getting into Ivy League schools were not in that top level middle school program. The kids that got into Ivy League schools were the ones who had the motivation and discipline to push themselves and not be satisfied with just passing. They were the kids that knew what they wanted to do and built  their lives around what they were passionate about.

You're really in a great place right now. Since you know that you're concerned about your grades you can now make sure that you are working towards fixing that issue. Don't be afraid to ask for help. The most successful people are the ones that ask for help. Think about how nice it is when someone explains something in a way that makes sense without you even asking and then realize that you can actually call on that whenever you'd like.

I would suggest getting involved next year at your high school in ways relevant to chemistry. See if they have some kind of science team or chemistry club or something tangentially related like a medical-science club. If you're worried about people judging you lol fuck em. If you have confidence in yourself and you know you're doing what you enjoy, then people won't really care what you do and you won't really care what people think. If you tell someone ""I'm on the science team, it's kinda weird"", they're more likely to think ""yeah that's kinda weird"". But if you tell them ""I'm on the science and it's dope as shit"", they're more likely to think ""oh, good for you, man"" (if they don't it's just because they're insecure about themselves and they feel better when they make other people feel insecure). It's all about confidence.

Also, I hope I'm not overestimating how interested you are in chemistry. You DO NOT need to have your life figured out right now. A lot of my advice applies to whatever it is that you want to do. There's a pretty good chance that you change what you want to be before you end up actually starting a career and that is super normal. I changed my mind constantly in high school about what I wanted to be and in college I ended up changing my major from political science to physics. Those kinds of changes are perfectly fine and don't harm your future as long as you're a driven student who is willing to work hard. I know a ton of people who similarly made huge changes during college like from engineering to economics or business to psychology. There's a lot of neat things in the world and there's no age where you're too old to change what you want to do.

Have the courage to do whatever it is that you are excited about. My sister originally went to a pretty standard college with a pretty standard major because she felt pressure to follow a ""normal"" path but she wasn't fully enjoying it so she transferred to an art school and majored in theatre and film she is really living her best life right now.

Be brave and be different. Don't try to follow what you see the kids around you doing because they aren't you and they don't know what's best for you. I'm honestly really excited for you and I'm wishing you all the best. Don't stress, your future is incredibly bright. If you ever have any concerns or questions about school or life or anything, feel free to send me a PM, I'd be more than happy to help you. Hopefully you took the time to read this whole thing and I hope I could help.";1;0.125;[[0.97774703]];[[0.68082278]];-0.9642;0.107;0.7170000000000001;0.17600000000000002;0.9997;0.223;0.727;0.05;-0.242;0.052708333333333336;0.2060961904761905;-0.15338785714285713

And it goes on until finally it's too close that the animal puts up a fight.  This is also known as DEADLINES.

When I realize this last year, I upgraded to Procrastination to horror villain status.  It can turn any task (even tiny ones) into like a persistent hunter for the primitive reptilian portion of our brain.

Now, just knowing THIS hopefully will help you nip procrastination in the bud and keep it from traumatizing your poor Monkey Brain.

If it's still too hard or you don't believe me, do ""Break It Down"" on your research paper.  Break down tasks into the most simple components to get ""Snowball Effect"" on your side.  And also to keep your ""Fast Think / System 1 / Monkey Brain"" from panicking about it in the first place and even to get it working on the paper quickly.  The key is to break down tasks to simple components.

There's a lot of insults thrown at Monkey Brain.  Even meditators are taught to treat it like a dumb animal.

Perhaps it's just picking one of the papers up and reading the introduction.

Do something related to the task for 5 minutes and then stop if you want, otherwise you may find you just want to keep going. 

Have a clear physical action as your starting point and then just get going on it without deliberation.

So just do something a little lighter and not as intense.

Exercise helps some people - it’s draining for others. 

The brain has a powerful way of messing with us. To be our own worst enemy. It know what it needs to do. Get the work done. But instead it tells us - hey we don’t want to do this! Let’s go out and see why we don’t want to! Let’s read these self help books, let’s join support groups, let’s self reflect and try to figure out why we are the way we are. 

I’ve read more than I care to admit on the topic of productivity and getting things done... it took me far too long to realize I was missing the elephant in the room. Instead of doing what needed to be done - I was instead completing the task of reading and learning about how to complete the tasks I should have done to begin with. 

Do what needs to be done. That is what discipline has come to mean to me. How to identify when the brain is trying to throw you on a wild goose chase and the ability snap yourself out of it and back doing the work you need to. So get back to the paper - who cares if you have reducing stamina / you want to surf Reddit / you want to watch Netflix / you think you need to exercise to give the energy to do the work you should be doing - they’re excuses.

However, the brain is easily tricked into believing it has already got what it wants through watching TV, playing video games, listening to music and other artificial stimulants. If you satisfy your needs without truly satisfying them (e.g. watching porn instead of having sex), your motivation will die because your brain thinks it has achieved its goals.

Because although I do have issues with motivation (which, I've discovered, has more to do with discipline), I also have sleep apnea. I never have any energy and am tired most of the time. Being really sleepy when you get home from work? That's me every day. I could give you tons of pointers to help, but if you are sure you don't snore then that's probably not you're issue. However, download the app 'snorelab' and record your nocturnal noises just in case. You don't have to be overweight to have sleep apnea, but that makes it more likely.

Second, go to your doctor and get a full blood work up done looking for vitiman deficiency. I take meds for seizures (that cause the weight gain that cause the sleep apnea) that make it hard for me to absorb certain vitimans, especially vitiman d, so I have to stay on top of these as well.

Those are the two possibilities that come to mind because I have (or am) experienced them. Either way, and this is the cop out answer of the century I know, but see your doctor.

From a different standpoint, if what you're experiencing is literally a lack of energy, you might want to talk to your doctor about getting some bloodwork done.  You might be deficient in nutrients like iron, vitamin D, B12, or something similar.  All of those can cause low energy, and can be pretty easy to not get enough of.  I have pretty severe anemia due to an autoimmune disease and it's when I get to the point like you describe where I just feel so lazy, it's way too much effort to do anything, that I realize I need to go back to my hematologist and get another iron IV.

I have never felt more refreshed/awake. Any tips on this would be appreciated]";208;"Basically, it's stressful, and we like to diminish stress. The easiest way is to avoid stresses. 

So what's so stressful, if you know you can do it? Well, it's not reading the papers, or mulling over them, or drawing correlations and conclusions, or writing your thoughts, or further research, or editing, or submitting that stresses you. It's the compounded stress of *this whole damn thing* that feels overwhelming. You're getting stressed out over the hard part before you've even done the easy parts.

Try this: get out paper, open a spreadsheet, anything you can record and edit. Break the *whole* task down. Break it into the bits I've described so far. Then break those bits into smaller bits. The initial research section: break it up into specific papers you've already identified. Does reading each of those seem achievable? If not, break the ones that don't seem achievable up even further. Break then up into a free pages at a time if you have to. Keep breaking it down until you've creating a series of achievable items. 

These are tasks. Don't worry about how long it takes to do them. Just do one. It won't be hard, you've made it that way on purpose. Now the next. Seriously, just keep going. Set a goal per day: complete 3 tasks. If you're still good to go after 3, maybe add a 4th. In a week you'll have read them all. Or two weeks. Who cares. Don't stress out about time, it's an illusion anyway. Just do the tasks until they are done. If time does matter for you (deadlines), all the more reason to do this exercise! After each task ask yourself ""Can I do another task, or do I need a break?"" If you need a break, take one. 10mins. 20mins. Get food, never ignore your belly or you won't get anything done. Have a conversation with someone. Now get back to another task.

Keep doing this for each of the sections. I promise you that when you stop thinking about *the entirety* of a project and *just do it*, it won't feel so bad. I know this is the same advice everyone gives, but the key for me is to keep breaking it down until I don't feel terrified if the individual items. They can be as small as ""find the resource I need to read somewhere online"", then break, then ""read 5 pages"", then break. Whatever it takes.

I thought all this time it was because there was something inherently wrong with me but now that I think about it, I do think that my lack of stamina was actually a feeling of being overwhelmed and perhaps fear. 

A couple years ago I had an epiphany that the reason why I slept so much was because I was terrified of my responsibilities. While it may have been obvious to the people around me, it was such a subtle point for me. Eventually, I thought I had this emotion under control. And yet, it appeared again, and I didn't recognize it. Underneath my frustration, I can't help but also think this is incredibly fascinating. I was tricked once again by my own self. It's really difficult to read the label when you're inside the jar, isn't it?

Anyways, seriously thank you because I might have spent another 5 years before I even thought this was related. I will definitely try to break down my tasks..and get a blood test. 
I wish you all luck (and discipline) in your endeavors.

so I'm looking for practical advice right now - I can identify with a lot of the threads here and currently, I face similar problems.

Normally, at work I don't have a problem working from 9-5 but since I am on holidays right now I can't sit down and actually be productive at all.

I'm looking for a complete overnight change here, since I hope that would create some kind of momentum for me to built on.

";14;"The **pomodoro technique** and **small goals** helped me immensely when I was first starting to try to use my free time productively.

I made a small goal to spend one pomodoro (25 minutes) working on something I felt resistance to every day. As long as I tried to be productive for that long each day I considered that day a success.

This was quite contrary to my old habit of overwhelming myself with big goals or thinking about how I had so much to do long enough to force me into doing nothing.

Another thing that helped me a ton was [tracking every pomodoro I completed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mEF3LKMs8I5OfThv4sQKIA4xmoBNe6iwfahEK5XRMIQ/edit) in a google sheet. This was **huge for momentum** because it let me see all my small 25 minute wins add up. I really can't recommend it enough.

&amp;nbsp;

Something I have been doing more of now is booking sessions on **focusmate** (www.focusmate.com). It can be hard to commit to productivity ahead of time and a little weird co-working with a stranger, but as someone who thrives on accountability, is a people pleaser, and wouldn't even dream of letting his partner down, it really works well for me.

I have always been able to let myself down, but letting teachers/coaches/friends/study partners down has never been something I would do and focusmate pretty much creates that scenario whenever I need it so I just lean in and use it to my advantage.

&amp;nbsp;

Hope this helps! Feel free to fire questions my way.

[NeedAdvice] Looking for an overnight productivity change to create some kind of momentum. Would appreciate any advice;t3_7vwnbs;3;"Hi everyone,

so I'm looking for practical advice right now - I can identify with a lot of the threads here and currently, I face similar problems. My daily routine is not good at the moment and I am really feeling down by it. I have a ton of work and studying todo and my finals are in six weeks. But I can't break out of this cycle where I am just sitting at home thinking about the tasks ahead and procrastinating instead of doing really anything. Normally, at work I don't have a problem working from 9-5 but since I am on holidays right now I can't sit down and actually be productive at all.

I'm looking for a complete overnight change here, since I hope that would create some kind of momentum for me to built on. Do you think this is sustainable at least for these six weeks and how would you approach that kind of task? I know that the fear I have created for this task at the moment is greater than the task itself, although it is a lot of work. I'd really appreciate any kind of help or advice on this matter. Thank you a lot for reading!
";14;" Check out The 5 Second rule by Mel Robbins. You don't have to read the book to understand it, it's such a simple rule. Watch this interview with her if you'd like to get the gist of it https://youtu.be/LCHPSo79rB4

It sounds to me like you KNOW what you should be doing but just can't get yourself to do it. Be optimistic that at least you've got half the battle done. A lot of people are at stage one and don't even know what they should be doing. Since you already know what to do, I think the 5 second rule will help. One of the good points she makes in the interview is that waiting for motivation is destined for failure. There are a lot of things that we must do to get to our goals and most of them are tedious, boring, hard, or just suck. You'll never feel like doing them or truly be motivated to do them. Instead if you know you have to do them to get to the next level, you just have to make yourself do them and the 5 second rule helps with that.

[NeedAdvice] I'm almost 25 years old and I don't know what should I do next in my life.;t3_8716w8;3;"Hi reddit, I need some advice about what should I do next in my life.  

So, after I had graduted from high school at 19 I went to university for 4 years.  Managed to finish it and get my diploma but at what price? It's an IT engineering degree but I went there just because my grades were enough to get a full ride. I was not interested in hardware, electrical circuits, signal processing or any of that. I am a software guy. So  it's hard to admit to myself but out of 50 subjects which I attended during those 4 years maybe maximum 5 of them were actually useful for me. I feel like I've wasted 4 years of my life. I wish I attended any bootcamp of 3 months and then went to work so now I would have +4 years of experience, since no one cares about having IT degree anyway nowadays. The only thing that kept me going was my side projects (MMORPG gameserver, also I had a hosting resell platform) which were quite profitable. Also I've had a couple relationships which helped me to distract myself.  

So fast forward, after I graduated uni I rellocated to UK and landed my first IT job in which I worked for 8 months. It was a sketchy solicitors company and I hated it with all my heart. I spent days in office together with another colleague who was 4 years older than me and had an ecomony degree with zero industrial software development experience. The guy was a narcissist, wouldn't shutup and was insecure about his own position so it was a pain to deal with him everyday. The guy was gaslighting, manipulating and treated me like a high school student or something. All I learned was how to maintain an obscure legacy solicitor platform and also basics of WPF and C# for desktop applications. However I didn't learn best practices, because most of shots were being called by an incompetent colleague. It was no point for me to even try implementing some structure in the codebase since I was being shut down at every turn. I realized that it was a toxic work environment I was loosing my confidence and will to learn new things so I had to do something. After few months I already had saved enough money so I started applying for other jobs. As soon as I've landed my second job I left my first one.  

Second job(and I am still working there) is in Czech Republic, city of Prague. It' an IOT startup. Salary is the same like my 1st job but it was an interesting opportunity to learn something new. It was an android developer position (I never worked with android, but managed to complete their given assignment in 2 weeks so they saw potential in me and hired me). Also they provided a rellocation package so first 3 months I was living in a hotel for free, so it looked like a good deal because I can leave after 3 months if I don't like it, what's the worst that can happen? So fast forward I have been staying here for 8 months already. During these 8 months I created 3-4 mobile apps which are somewhat working but no one is using them because startup has not yet been established and all the work which we did up until now was mockups and demos to attract new clients. Currently  the startup it is being funded by mother company so until we start being profitable, there won't be any raises for anyone. Also note that I am the only mobile dev in here so there is no one to mentor me. At first I liked this freedom because it was completely opposite from my 1st job. But now I see that in 8 months I haven't progressed nearly as much as I wanted to. I decided that in order to progress I would need to join a mobile app oriented startup/company to learn best practices. 
Now about the current country, Czech which I live in. I am a foreigner (EU citizen) living in this country and I have no interest in learning their language since only 10 million people live here. Because I am an expat, I won't be able to get a loan for my own flat/house (only if I would live here 5 years).  I am not able to even get a phone bundle and pay in installments here. I don't see my future in this country.  

I don't see future in this job, country or current relationship. The only things that are holding me here is that I've become comfortable with my international colleagues from the startup and I am too comfortable with my current girlfriend(which will leave me in 6-9 months). I am not even sure if I want to search for another company since I feel that I can expand my side projects and live from them (I am already making a second salary from my side projects). The only thing that I am afraid of is that I will be closed off between 4 walls and I won't have colleagues to interact with nor a nice relationship.   

So basically now ideally I would decide in which country I will live in, move there, then either continue my mobile dev careeer or continue working on my sideprojects. Work for 2-3 years, get a nice flat/house and start a family. However I haven't travelled much, haven't seen much so I have many questions which need to be answered first..   
  
**TL;DR** 
  
Hi reddit, I need some advice about what should I do next in my life.  

I already have an IT degree (although I wasted 4 years for it, bcs only few subjects were interesting for me).  

First job I worked in UK for 8 months in a toxic workplace which I hated.  

Second job where I still work for the last 8 months is an IOT startup in Czech Republic.  

This time I have nice colleagues, nice casual relationship with a girl(however she's leaving in few months for good).  

However I am  not advancing professionally anymore as much as I would want to (I am the only one doing mobile dev, I don't have mentors). I don't see a future for myself in this country(obscure language barrrier, not a good cultural fit and etc.). All I am doing for the past 1-2 months is distracting myself. Not sure what to do next. Maybe I should leave this job, go back to my home country and start my own gig? I already have experience on my sideprojects where I am already making a second salary. I am tired of offices and capitalism, where I see people putting max 10 hours weekly into their work bcs all they care is paycheck. The only thing that I am afraid of  is that I would need to start my life all over again (did it 2 times already in UK and CZ). Also if I focus on my own gig, I will be closed off between 4 walls and I won't have colleagues to interact nor a nice relationship.

";17;"you have to want something bad enough IMO for change to take root. Only you can figure out what it is you want. From my own experience I know myself and others have had ideas about what we ""should"" be based on secondary goals like ""Being attractive to the opposite sex"" or ""being popular"". Those don't tend to bring the deep down change or discipline we're looking for. Someone that says ""I want to learn to play the guitar"" but doesn't practice when they have free time ...doesn't really want to learn to play the guitar.  Someone that wants to look like a model but never works out when they have free time...doesn't really want it. What you have to admit is that your current choices reflect what you currently want, and for a lot of us that means sitting around and killing hours on reddit rather than doing something productive. (replace reddit with netflix, youtube, games, etc). 

There are two ways to change internal and external. I've done both. The easy one is external but it sucks, like it really sucks. This is where you handover your choices to someone else like an institution where there are real consequences. Prison and the Army come to mind, I was in the latter. 

Internal comes from a drive from something you've decided to define as part of who you are. You eat well not for other secondary reasons but because you like the way eating well makes you feel. You don't lie because other people don't like liars, you don't lie because you're not the kind of person who lies. 

Right now you're the kind of person who goes on reddit all day. So.. you go on reddit all day. 

You mentioned rewards, the best ones I've found are ones that take a LONG time. Losing weight, having more muscle, having better credit rating, being able to play an instrument, knowing how to speak a foreign language. There are no immediate satisfying rewards that have a lasting effect IMO. In fact the easier/faster it is to achieve the less satisfying it is to me.

tl;rd you're not doing things you want to do because you don't REALLY want to do them. Evaluate your goals, narrow them down, think about why they matter. Play the why game ""I want to learn to play guitar""..""why""...""because I like ____""...""why""....because ___"" and keep going down that hole. 

lastly enjoy the process. Sometimes the reward is looking at the hard work you're doing right now or the hard work you've put in over the last few weeks/months. Define who you are, maybe you don't have a clear picture of who you are yet, maybe you need to go try things out or talk to people who do different things. 

This is just one way of looking at it and I could be completely wrong. Good luck. ";2;0.11764705882352942;[[0.9672427]];[[0.68849396]];0.6643;0.141;0.7559999999999999;0.10400000000000001;0.9974;0.212;0.72;0.069;-0.106;-0.2130952380952381;0.1028613199665831;-0.3159565580618212
[NeedAdvice] How do I become more extroverted so I surround myself with specific types of friends (in post);t3_887oif;3;"Hey guys, I've just been looking at different subreddits to see how I can fill my time effectively. As I looked into different posts, I started wondering how can I fill my time productively at school with friends. Now, the specific types of friends I'm looking for are the ones who are good at different things and willing to help me improve and find new things to try (extroversion comes into here). However, most kids in my school seem to not be good at any particular thing I want to try (hard to explain, plz bear with me here). Like, they just seem to be the type of person to just exist in society, but not have any special talents can be utilized. In contrast (I'm not trying to brag), I constantly do good at school and developed some good habits (exercise, learning new things) and therefore I do have talents that I can put to use. However, I still need to improve and feel like I'm limiting myself too much by assuming that to my standards, if someone isn't good at something and not trying to self-improve then they're utterly useless. I believe this limitation has caused me to not make as many friends that can potentially help me improve but also cause me not to appreciate my own friends as much.

Also, another limitation I put in place is approachability and willingness. For example (I'll use 3 of my friends, M, D and J let's call them), J is an athletic person and really likes running. However, he is the type of person who needs to improve on being nicer to friends, as he gets discouraging when he sees us running slower than him on the track or lifting less weights than him. Thus, I don't feel like I can be a better person around him because of his approachability. As for my other friend M, he's not useless in my standards (sorry if I'm being mean), but not good at any specific thing either. He's just that grey area in between because he is a bit fat so he needs to improve himself first in the gym before helping anyone else so therefore he doesn't have any specific tips to offer me. Lastly, my friend D is similar to my friend M, being in that grey area in between. As you know in the famous quote ""You are who you surround yourself with"", I mentioned the case for my 3 friends because I'm the one who's surrounding them and helping them get better but I feel like I'm not self-improving enough in return. Basically, they're the ones who are surrounding themselves with good friends (me), but in my perspective I'm not surrounding myself with such people because I'm helping others but I have no one else help me (I didn't mean to sound selfish). In short, I have no one that can help take/guide me to the next level of things I want to accomplish.

In conclusion, the bottom line is I want to take myself to the next level of personal improvement but I feel like I limit that by imposing standards (talent on a certain subject, charisma and willingness) on people around me and not surrounding myself with potentially motivated people by using my standards to filter out which friend/person I feel are disciplined and good enough to help me discover and improve myself. Often times I feel like I'm their guide who takes them to the next level but I don't that enough for myself.

Thanks!";1;Hey man, why don't you maybe try and help your friends improve, like you could tell your friend J that he is discouraging you with your approach, maybe he doesn't see it the way you do. You can push your other two friends to try harder. It's good karma for you and it will help make the bound to your friends stronger. But I don't know, maybe they just aren't into changing, I had friends like that so gradually we grew apart.

[NeedAdvice] 22 yo, full time software developer, got problems with productivity and procrastination;t3_7xabsd;2;"Hi guys,

I’m 22 yo guy living in Poland and working as software developer. I’m living with girlfriend in rented house, got separate room for my home office so in theory I got perfect opportunity to build new app, learning etc. Also I got amazing passion/hobby which are road cycling, I spent about 4-6h per week on training. I think this intro is for now enough.

I got big problem with procrastinate and sometimes with productivity. When I come back to home it’s usually took me about one hour before starting training for example. I think when I will not procrastinate then I can reduce this time to 20-25 minutes, but, always I turn on iPad/Laptop and start scrooling some facebook, twitter, or other sites. This is for me pretty common.

Even when I don’t have training but only work on my projects/blogs/learning I started procrastinate and this take me a lot of more time… 

Normally this will be not problem, just normal living but, recently I started two side project (one which I will use at work, its about scrum things for work, and another is job board for developers in Poland) I wan’t to developer two projects, but mainly focused on job board, not only from development perspective but also from marketing and finding first customer side. So i think 20% time for scrum app, and 80% time from project for job board.

Things are simply here, but, I saw that i forgot about updating my blog about programming, and never switch from Polish to English posts so then I don’t learn and improve soft skills.

The worst thing for end, I got also blog about my passion, I like it a lot, but since starting developer blog I don’t  write any post, so I think about seven month without any update.

I know there is a lot of work to do working full time, developing something like own startup, updating two blogs and making app for scrum process…

I’m very ambitious and wan’t to handle it on my own back, and when can’t outsource some things to other. For example right now I got one Intern who help me developing app for scrum, so I can more focus job board…

Im using toggl to track my productive hours after work, and results was very disappointed for me mainly from 5h in front of computer i spend 1.5-2h productive. So I think, if only I can work more productive and without procrastinate I could handle all task without any problem. But I don’t know how to became more productive and less procrastinate. I tried a lot times for example wake up earlier, but it’s hard for me, sometimes when i lay in bed too long i feel like crap potato.

I tried book time on calendar for wake up, going to sleep earlier, don’t drink too much coffee, apps like Habitica. For productivity sometimes I used pomodoro technique, but I do 1-2 session, and after that I don’t schedule next, I think i got lack of habit for this type of helpers.

Really wan’t to change my life but it’s harder than I think";2;"&gt;I know there is a lot of work to do working full time, developing something like own startup, updating two blogs and making app for scrum process

You are right it is a lot of work. You are working hard and it's  difficult to stay productive all the time. Human body needs a rest. So make sure as well that you are well rested. Plan your restate time and make sure you get enough. Also choose your priorities. Is running 2 blogs important for your long term goals. If not then give it up. Part of being disciplined is ability to quit things that don't bring us benefits.

Don't just do mindless things like reddit or youtube videos. Plan your time well. Go for a walk with your girlfriend. Meet some friends, do a puzzle or read a book. Always have plan for your evening otherwise you will always end up on reddit.

As for staying productive I suggest reading Deep Work by Cal Newport this book teaches some great habits.  

Short take from it is plan your work, have good schedle and clear cut of time at which you move to rest mode where you do no more work for a day no mater what. Reduce distractions in your life. Many of us seek distractions a lot standing in a shop we go on a phone, at home we turn tv on the moment we walk in. This conditions our brain to always seek new things and makes it unable to stay focused for longer. Try to be mindful of those things during a day and your ability to stay focused will improve.";2;1.0;[[0.97361346]];[[0.69284849]];0.9575;0.086;0.863;0.051;0.9808;0.155;0.79;0.055999999999999994;-0.064;0.04894155844155845;0.14668625025767884;-0.0977446918161204

I took trazodone just to ensure I can sleep well, I rarely take sleeping pills, but this one helped. 10:55 PM and I'm asleep. It should be 8-9 PM, but I felt rested after waking up. The problem is, it took me 30-40 minutes to boot up. I saw myself browsing because my den is super cold, it takes awhile for the heater to warm things up.

I was ready after 30 minutes, but before I could move out of the driveway, it was already too late. Traffic beat me to it and I would only waste more time and gas because I would have arrived an hour and a half late. I can't really blame the city or people.

I just have this lack of discipline when it comes to shutting down, sleeping and waking up. It's the cold in the morning but it's also the de-stressing. I have no problem being productive during work, or when time is really pressed, but I don't want to rely on accountabilities either, it just gives me anxiety. I have no problems with sleep and can sleep on command.

What are some ways I can do to prevent this? I think early preparation will prevent this kind of lag, like 2-3 days in advance, prepping the morning meals, having the failsafe (sleeping pills) and maybe even putting a program that will prevent me browsing, perhaps it's my willpower that needs help?";5;Bro soon as alarm goes off, just fucking fly your fucking body forward, and stand up.

I was ready after 30 minutes, but before I could move out of the driveway, it was already too late. Traffic beat me to it and I would only waste more time and gas because I would have arrived an hour and a half late. I can't really blame the city or people.

I just have this lack of discipline when it comes to shutting down, sleeping and waking up. It's the cold in the morning but it's also the de-stressing. I have no problem being productive during work, or when time is really pressed, but I don't want to rely on accountabilities either, it just gives me anxiety. I have no problems with sleep and can sleep on command.

What are some ways I can do to prevent this? I think early preparation will prevent this kind of lag, like 2-3 days in advance, prepping the morning meals, having the failsafe (sleeping pills) and maybe even putting a program that will prevent me browsing, perhaps it's my willpower that needs help?";5;"There are several issues I can identify here:
If you aren't used to taking sleeping pills, you aren't used to waking up after them either. Taking pills to sleep the night before a morning commitment is going to make it difficult to get up the next day, no matter how well, or early you slept.

Problems with browsing? set up internet blockers/download an app on your phone that cuts it off at a certain time. 

Problems with traffic? Leave earlier. Plan to leave earlier. Install fail safes (i.e. even if I'm not ""ready"" at a certain time I'm leaving, be it no shower, no coffee, or no breakfast. That way, I'm more motivated to to better the next time in order to have a more enjoyable experience). 

Here's my morning routine: 
Music starts an hour before I need to get out of bed. Alarms start going off every 15 minutes after. Several are across the room with water and pills next to it, so that I take those mindlessly with the benefit of waking myself up. I have a BRIGHT light come on over my head when I NEED to get up (which still gives me the half hour I need to have a ""good"" morning). I get up and do my things (with alarms every 15 minutes so that I keep track of time. My light shuts off 10 minutes before I need to leave, I go downstairs and make coffee and leave the house with time to spare in case of traffic. 

On bad days: All of the above still happen. I might stay in bed up to an extra 30 minutes, but the light stays on. I don't have access to the switch from my bed. I normally can't stand to have it on in my face for more than a half hour. I end up throwing on clothes, attempting to pass for professional (15-20 min) and head downstairs to make coffee/leave when the light goes off.

Once I am up, I don't sit down. I don't make excuses. It doesn't matter how late I stay up, or how poorly I sleep. I'm up the next day. If I run late, I still go. Why? Punishment. If I enjoy staying up because I enjoy sleeping in, its going to perpetuate itself.

If you develop consistently good habits then A)lazy mornings will be that much more enjoyable because they will be rare and B) when it truly matters, it won't be an issue. 

The takeaway? Stop making excuses. Identify the issues and find a way to correct them, consistently. Anticipate problems so that they won't occur. 

If you ""automate"" your morning routine, you eliminate the internal battle.

For me it’s to awful to try to wrench myself out of bed immediately so I’ll usually try to beat that sleepy fog by doing something fairly active on my phone like checking notifications or something. Usually the screen brightness and activity is enough to wake me up. Just be careful not to do something that’ll relax you.

Another method would be setting a couple alarms before your final one (let’s say one 15 minutes before you need to wake up and another 5 minutes before). In theory, you’ve had your sleep interrupted enough times that your body should start producing cortisol and doing all the other things it needs to do to wake you up fully. Just make sure that last alarm is louder or different so you don’t snooze it.

Finally, I take 3-5mg of melatonin about an hour before bed. I would give it a try if you haven’t already. Some people say that it makes them sleepier the next morning but for me, it puts me out quick and I tend to actually wake up before my alarm on it. I usually only use it when I know I’m going to have trouble. Either way since it’s pretty natural and non-habit forming, it works well for making gradual adjustments to your sleep schedule too.";2;0.4;[[0.97568798]];[[0.60985496]];-0.7384;0.10300000000000001;0.7809999999999999;0.11599999999999999;0.8746;0.114;0.809;0.077;-0.05000000000000002;0.022839506172839516;-0.025568181818181827;0.04840768799102134
[NeedAdvice]Motivated to start a new business, but afraid I'll lose interest like every time!;t3_7xy2n9;2;Hey guys, I need some help! I was in a horrible mood lately and haven't been productive at all. Anyway, I'm better now and the thing is I have this great idea for starting a new business. I have been through that several times before and I always end up ditching the whole project. I start out super motivated and then I burn out and give up. I really really need that to not happen again! This project has real potential and I already have some background in it. It's also something that interests me and I really see a market for it. Help please, I don't wanna screw this up.;1;"There's a great quote: ""If you fear it, it will happen""

Breaking that down: If your thoughts are pre-occupied with ""what if the same thing happens again"" you have less room for thoughts regarding how to mitigate that scenario, and therefore you don't do those things that could mitigate that risk because you're not thinking about them.

Let's take an example: let's say you're afraid of jumping off the high dive. You're afraid it'll hurt. One option is to treat your fears as something you just need to push though, and then you'll go off the high dive nervous as hell and it'll probably hurt. If, instead, you take it seriously, and do some research for proper form for jumping off the high dive, and focus on getting the form right, you'll still be a little scared, but you'll be prepared, and you'll be more focused on getting it right than on your fear of a little pain.

To bring it back to you, keep the focus on your end goal and how you can achieve it as effectively and quickly as possible. Take it one step at a time, but keep reminding yourself of your goal. And again, your goal is not ""don't lose interest"", your goal is ""start a new business"" (modify as appropriate, but make sure it is a positive, measurable goal, and not an ""avoid-this"" goal or one that can't be measured).

Hope that helps. Good luck!";2;2.0;[[0.96147545]];[[0.68159562]];0.9672;0.225;0.745;0.03;0.8207;0.122;0.765;0.113;0.18600000000000003;0.0933080808080808;0.12331289081289082;-0.03000481000481002

[Needadvice] How do I resist the urge to eat out and stick to a healthy diet?;t3_7xzyr2;3;I'm trying to lose weight but it's been a struggle for me. I can stick to intermittent fasting (skipping lunch) for several days, until I give in to the urge to eat out at a restaurant somewhere. How do I stick to a consistent schedule of dieting and exercise?;3;"Your principle question is about motivation and only you can motivate yourself. If you want tips, I sure googling self motivation will have lots of results. The other aspect to your question is overcoming wanting to eat out. 

First, skipping meals has be shown to be ineffective in losing weight. Don't do that. It is best to eat more meals with less at each meal (maybe four a day, but at least three smaller meals). 

Second, you may want to eliminate things that fuel you appetite or are not good for you (sugar is a huge one). I now sweeten everything with Stevia (both liquid and powder). I had to add both stevia and sugar at first, but eventually was able to reduce the sugar to zero. It takes effort and will power, but cutting out certain things will make a ton of difference. Again, you can google some of the most important things to eliminate from you diet.  

Finally, if you create meals tailored to your specific taste and that aren't typically found in restaurants, eating out loses its appeal. Plus, you can make meals with less calories and better nutrition. For example, I like Asian food and have created unique meals based on an Asian diet. (Rice, curries, coconut milk, etc.) I rarely eat carbohydrates or glutenous products. But, most importantly, I flavor things with the seasonings I love and combine them in ways no one else does. For example I make a mango, coconut, chicken soup that makes my taste bud sing. You can also throw in a few things to make it interesting. For example, I put dried cranberries in lots of things. It is that sudden burst of unusual flavor that makes eating fun. Try this with chicken salad, yum. 

I also make rice paddies with red rice, beans (I like black beans), an egg, vegetables, and a meat of choice and season it with various spices. I like coriander, turmeric, ginger, chipotle, lime flavor (from limes or from a power you can get at an Asian store), Cardamon, smoked paprika, Bonita flakes (Japanese), miso flavoring and many more spices. I make different rice patties with different combinations of spices and freeze them in the perfect size. I can then toss a frozen patty in a pan with coconut oil and have a quick meal (maybe include a salad). I love this so much and just don't go to restaurants any more because none are as good as what I make at home. Of course, my tastes may be quite different than yours so you have to investigate things that work for you. But with a little effort you can make homemade meals that beat anything in a restaurant.

A person I used to be close with is really getting ahead in their career, close to making it really big.

It's so wrong-- every time I get angry I think, no, cut that out, you're being ridiculous, and try never to take it out on anyone-- but I don't get less angry.

They're such a good person and they think I'm good person too; I feel both guilty about this but also relieved, because it means they don't know how angry at them I find myself.

This happens constantly in life, as life is not fair all the time and sometimes undeserving people get ahead.

These are things you cannot control. However, how you react to it and what you can do about it is in your control.

One thing you can do is to identify the gaps in your skillsets and knowledge and work with a mentor or professor or manager to get to where you need to be.

Also understand that every career path is different with different trajectories and what works for your friend may not be the right path for you and even if it is,  the  timeline may be very different.

Thank-you!";2;"Honestly, if this person is successful or this person fails, it makes zero difference in your life. There isn’t a limit on how many people can be successful, good looking, whatever, so this person’s success doesn’t take away from your journey. It only can...in your head...if you let it. The truth is that your progress depends only on you, and letting another person’s success get in your head is a red herring and a stumbling block. 
I work in a competitive profession and it definitely very 80/20 (20% of the people have 80% of the business). The common denominator among the losers? They can’t get ahead because “there’s too much competition.” They can’t see how they limit themselves with their shitty attitude. They are subconsciously failing to pursue opportunities because they’ve decided that “other people” have all the success. Successful people focus on themselves and if they see a good technique or habit, they incorporate it. They don’t feel jealous.

[NeedAdvice] I understand that motivation is secondary. But what about purpose and motive?;t3_7wltqz;4;"I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and probably other issues at least since I was ten. 

I lack motivation, and I have even less discipline. 

I understand the argument that one does not need motivation, but discipline. 

However, that seems like a moot point for me. I can have neither, since behind both motivation and discipline there is purpose and motive.

I am depressed. What makes depression what it is, is exactly the lack of purpose in one's life. I can rationalize all I want, I still lack the purpose to get out of my bed, sit on that chair and study. And even if I do that, I lack the resistance to endure long enough, so I'll never accomplish my goal. This is not me thinking ahead, this is me narrating my past.

See, I do have a very clear objective right now. I just ignore it because... What's the point.

Most of the advice I see here seems to ignore that, even when the OP doesn't have depression. Motivation, discipline, none of that matters if you don't have any purpose.

 I'd appreciate it if people who have struggled with depression before would care to try and give me some advice.

I have a clear objective (administrative job at my uni). I know that it will help me to get out of the situation which aggravates my depression a great deal. I know that it will even make me 'happy'. I can visualize it clearly in my head. And yet I simply cannot get out of my bed, sit on my chair, open the laptop, make a study plan and compromise to study for the next 2 months until the exam. I'd rather watch bad shows on Netflix as I've done the past two days.

Thanks in advance.

So if it's Accounting or Business Communications, what are you actually going to cover in terms of those subjects?

What topics/subjects/chapters or what test papers, assignments, projects will you work on etc.

Try to chunk it down as best you can within that time slot.

Alternatively, you can just figure this out beforehand and map it into your calendar but it can be a bit more cumbersome.

If you prefer smashing out one course's work for the week then you can do that for sure, perhaps set aside dedicated days for each one that works with your schedule.

So maybe Monday for Accounting, Tuesday for business communications.

Whenever you're taking on someone else's advice or suggestions you should try and adapt it to what you know works best for you - given that it is actually best for you!

Like it's hard to get it to focus on one thing and then once you do - it feels like a humongous pain to have to shift your attention to another thing.

Two problematic factors involved - 1)  Your marvelous brain is too full.  2)  You're stressed out while studying which makes your attention sticky and hard to move around.

Have too much experience with that.  God, there was a time when I hate it HATE it when people interrupt me while I was working.

Now, I'm a multi-tasker (again).  Switching attention around is easy.

Until just recently - I'd recommend meditation to tackle ""sticky attention"" syndrome, BUT we gotta address the ""too full brain"" problem first otherwise you won't even have the brain slack to pick up meditation.

We need to cut stress at the knees, and the best way to do that is help, actual help, from real people in your general area.  Like just knowing that you have a family to catch you if you fall is such a big load off the brain.  Let's face a harsh truth, the best disciplined people tend to have good social networks.  Either that, or a lot of money in the bank...

Meditation 

Connect with real people in your life.

Also, excitement is NOT rest and relaxation.  Too many brains these days are overworked and exhausted due to chasing after excitement, the fucking stick in the carrot on a stick.

1)  You need actual rest and relaxation.  SLEEP.  Do not think.  Meditation.  Your brain needs to rest, really rest.  Shut down and cool down.

2)  You need to be more picky about what gets in limited brain attic, cause you’re already at the limit.  That means cutting down on both stress and excitement, so your brain stops foolishly tagging whatever as enemy or resource.

Don't do things you waste time on or procrastinate with on your break.

Instead just go for a walk, do some physical movement - pushups, squats etc - close your eyes and do some deep breathing. Read a book.

[NeedAdvice] How do I get out of bed?;t3_826a68;8;"Hey everyone.

I don't really know what to do with my sleeping. When I wake up I normally fall asleep for another hour or so, sometimes more and sometimes not at all. Regardless, I then stay in bed in a half-asleep state until roughly 12pm-1pm. 

This happens regardless of when I sleep; I can sleep anywhere between 10pm and 6am and I'll get out of bed at the same time. I've tried consistently sleeping at 10pm until 7am and I still keep myself in bed for like 5 hours. If there's sufficient reason to get up, like I have classes or a doctors appointment or whatever then it's much easier and this isn't a problem (although I'll still stay in bed for 30-90 minutes).

I jog 3x a week and if I can't fit it in, I do jump rope in place of it. I intermittently fast, skipping breakfast, but I've done that for 7 years. I use a light-based alarm clock to wake up ""more naturally"" with the whole blue light thing, along with multiple phone alarms, and my bed/mattress isn't particularly old. I use flu.x and twilight on my mobile and PC. I recently cut out sugar, and I try to have things in my day to look forward to but I just don't seem to care in a morning. 

Once I'm up and about I don't think I'm any more tired than the average person, so I don't think it's a sleep quantity issue, and I've tried sticking to a wake, sleep or both schedule. I've also tried cutting caffeine before bed.

TLDR: I can sleep for 6-12+ hours and still sleep in even more, I can't seem to get out of bed for hours even after I wake up unless I have an external stress like class, once I'm up I'm fine. What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance.";3;"When you don't have the motivation of the day to help you get out of bed, you've got to rely on your own personal willpower to get you up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I used to suffer from this same issue for years during my journey towards self improvement. I had managed to change my diet, exercise more, be more productive, but sleep and waking up in the morning was always something I struggled with. Like you, I'd go to bed around 10-11PM, get 7-8 hours of sleep, and wake up to just lay there in bed for a while. Sometimes, I'd even go back to sleep. 

I tried altering my diet to see if I was lacking energy, moving my workouts to the morning, thinking maybe I was just exhausting myself the night of. Perhaps it was my phone use, though I'd use blue light apps to keep from messing up my sleep, and maybe my brain was too active during bed time that I was waking up too tired to tackle the day immediately? 

&amp;nbsp;

However, just like you, those external factors were always something that got me moving in the morning: 

- I've got that math test today, I can't stay in bed because otherwise, I fail that test, and my grade seriously suffers. 
- I've got that dentist/doctors appointment, and if I miss that, I risk my health. 
- A friend or family member is coming over today, I've got to get everything cleaned up and ready for them. 
- Work in is 1 hour, I'd better get my ass moving! 

I could always move when it was something external that called to me, or at least, so I thought. Because though the situations listed above certainly got me moving in the morning, there were similar situations that kept me in the bed, even though they too were external forces. Things like: 

- I've got class today, but the homework is online. I'll just stay in bed. 
- I'm suppose to schedule an appointment with my doctor, but I'll do it later/tomorrow. 
- A friend wants to hang out today, but it's already so late. I'll reschedule. 
- I've got work in 6 hours, I could get up now, but I'll just chill for a few hours. 

I got to wondering why the first list was something that could get me out of bed, even though I didn't want to, though everything in the second list didn't move me at all. If anything, they seemed to give me leeway to procrastinate even more and remain in bed for 1-2 hours. As I thought to myself and looked over these scenarios, I became aware of the issue, and the answer to my staying in bed problem. 

&amp;nbsp;

**I relied on external factors to get me up in the morning.** Not just any external factors, obviously, but those that immediately affected my well-being and current state of life. 

- Of course I'm going to get up in the morning for that math test. If I fail, my grade falls and I risk failing the class, hindering my progress in school and potentially life. **However**, what hurt will one absence do in the grand scheme of things? Plus, the homework is online, so I still get my points today! 

- Of course I'm going to get up in the morning for that doctors appointment. I could have something wrong with me that if left alone, could risk my overall health. What if I've got cancer!? **However**, what hurt will waiting one day to schedule the appointment do? I'll still get seen, so it's not like I'm missing an appointment. 

- Of course I'm going to get up in the morning for my mom coming to visit the house. I can't leave the place in the mess it's in, what will she think? **However**, what hurt will waiting until tomorrow to schedule her coming over do? Especially if we haven't decided on a set date just yet? That gives me the whole day to clean, then I can just relax until she comes tomorrow! 

- Of course I'm going to get up in the morning for work in 1 hour. If I don't show up for work, I get fired. If I'm fired, I don't get money to support my current lifestyle. I risk homelessness and starvation! **However**, if work isn't until 6PM, and I'm up at 12PM, I've got 6 more hours! I can lay in bed and relax for another 2 hours, get up at 2, and still have 4 hours to get ready. Maybe I'll push that to 3PM and have an equal 3 hours to get ready! 

&amp;nbsp;

The issue should be easy to see now. If it wasn't something that had the potential to mess up my lifestyle, health or general well-being immediately, I couldn't be bothered. Yes there was the convenience of doing those things a little earlier and having more time afterwards, or having the convenience of not having to worry about them once I tackled them, but that inconvenience of actually doing those things early versus remaining comfortable in bed? Forget about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

We all have numerous times throughout our day where we think to ourselves, ""I should be doing 'x' thing right now"". After we think this, we begin to think about doing that task. We weigh the work we'd have to do to see that task through, versus whatever we're currently doing right now, and 99% of the time, we choose to remain comfortable instead of choosing to tackle that task, putting it off until later. Though as I'm sure you, and everyone else can relate, later doesn't ever come until it's something you simply **can't** ignore anymore. That immediate external force gets you moving because if you continue to ignore it, it'll put you in a more uncomfortable state than if you just deal with it. That's how a lot of our decision making works.

&amp;nbsp;

So, how do you fix your current sleeping problem? I have 3 solutions for you. You can choose which one to follow, and which one will best benefit you in the long term. 

1. When you wake up in the morning, and inevitably face that mental voice say, ""I should get up now"". Don't try and evaluate what you have going on in the day to determine if you have to get up **right now**, simply get up. You've already got some positive feedback in the past in knowing that once you do get up, you're good. You feel great and you get the day started. That's important self evaluation. Use that! As you continue to get up in the morning, you'll gradually work this routine into a habit, and before you know it, you'll be getting up in the morning without having to think about it. Win-Win situation! 

2. Double down on the fact that those immediate external factors are what get you up in the morning. Start putting yourself in situations where you have to get up in the morning. Make more plans with people, schedule more appointments more often, get a job, or a second job so you have that financial push to get moving in the morning much more often. Obviously this isn't an ideal situation to be in, but hey, it's certainly a solution. 

3. Read this entire post, think profoundly on it. Agree with many, if not all it's points, and save it so that you may visit it again. Why save it? Because if you didn't choose solution 1 or 2, then you're going to continue doing what you're doing now. You're going to continue waking up in the morning and remain in bed for hours on end, wasting your own time and eventually reach a point where you realize you aren't satisfied with your current sleeping habits. You're going to come to Reddit, start looking around for solutions to your problem, and miraculously remember that you saved this answer for just the occasion! Then, you're going to read this entire thing over again, and be faced with these 3 solutions, yet again. Hopefully you don't fall into that cycle.

This happens regardless of when I sleep; I can sleep anywhere between 10pm and 6am and I'll get out of bed at the same time. I've tried consistently sleeping at 10pm until 7am and I still keep myself in bed for like 5 hours. If there's sufficient reason to get up, like I have classes or a doctors appointment or whatever then it's much easier and this isn't a problem (although I'll still stay in bed for 30-90 minutes).

I jog 3x a week and if I can't fit it in, I do jump rope in place of it. I intermittently fast, skipping breakfast, but I've done that for 7 years. I use a light-based alarm clock to wake up ""more naturally"" with the whole blue light thing, along with multiple phone alarms, and my bed/mattress isn't particularly old. I use flu.x and twilight on my mobile and PC. I recently cut out sugar, and I try to have things in my day to look forward to but I just don't seem to care in a morning. 

Once I'm up and about I don't think I'm any more tired than the average person, so I don't think it's a sleep quantity issue, and I've tried sticking to a wake, sleep or both schedule. I've also tried cutting caffeine before bed.

TLDR: I can sleep for 6-12+ hours and still sleep in even more, I can't seem to get out of bed for hours even after I wake up unless I have an external stress like class, once I'm up I'm fine. What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance.";3;"Yeah!  I started having this issue last August, when I could only get out of bed if I had something that I really had to do (work,meetings, class, etc.).  Recently I started owing my runs to the morning, and in order to get up at 6:00 AM everyday I have to hide my phone somewhere new each night.  I would set my alarm and put my phone in my running shorts, then take my shorts and push it down the sleeve of my jacket, then tie my jacket up in a weird knot.  Then put my jacket in a shoebox and tie a belt around it.  

Come alarm time, I have to get up and undo all the nonsense I did the night before just to turn off ""Atomic Man"" by Portugal! The Man.

It's been helping.

EDIT:  I misspelled ""moving my runs to the morning"" as ""owing my runs to the morning,"" and I think I like this better.";1;0.33333333333333337;[[0.96155212]];[[0.50294167]];-0.9179;0.053;0.858;0.08900000000000001;0.2404;0.065;0.862;0.073;-0.028000000000000004;0.11794871794871795;-0.016021324354657692;0.13397004230337564

Thanks in advance.";3;"I'm fascinated by how you're apathetic in your inability to get out of bed. I also struggle to get out of bed, but it usually comes from feelings of dread and struggling to make my brain to pick one thing to focus on! 

Hell, I'd say use that apathy to your advantage. I think people often want to wake up feeling inspired and motivated, but frankly sometimes it's fine to just...wake up. Like, getting out of bed doesn't have to be some invigorating experience, y'know? I don't get jazzed to brush my teeth in the morning; it's just another human responsibility.

Try turning that extra time in bed into something worthwhile. If you stay in for an extra 30-90 minutes, make sure you put a book on your nightstand and spend that time reading. Is there a hobby you've wanted to try? That time where you're just chillin' in bed by yourself can be a great time to just...chill and do some cool shit.

Maybe getting into the habit of *doing* something during these times will help your brain stop perceiving those moments as sleep-time. You also mention you jog multiple times a week - perhaps having mornings be your exercise times can be that thing that gets you out of bed.

There is a problem where if you try to force and force yourself to study at school you'll learn to hate it. There are actually probably subconscious reasons you can't focus, such as being a little (dopamine or serotonin, forget which) addicted due to redditing, facebooking, youtubing. Potentially being stressed due to not allowing good enough to be good enough (until you can rationalise it due to time constraints).

My advice is two fold. First, just go to uni, your exams take precedence over trying to change your habits at home. If this is not possible and libraries don't work, find an outside area to work if you can, so that your mind can't be so distracted by trivialities.

Second, I would personally say you should introspect and find out why you're so distracted, ask yourself questions about why you feel the way you do, talk to people about them, your parents, your friends. Is it the subject? The teacher? Perfectionism? Unhappiness with other areas of your life?

I'm:

-Depressed and anxious(i've had constant panic attacks, I have tried meds and they didn't work)

-a leech(I spend money that I should not be spending, I don't have a job, I live with my succesful uncle in a different country after moving)

-a failure(I practically failed highschool, failed two driving tests, behind on my major in college, have a 3.5 which is good but its only because I take subjects I've done before so it's easy and for the rest I rely on a really disciplined friend of mine). I've got family members who've went to Harvard, MIT, NYU with full scholarships, doctors, software engineers, etc.. and I study CS at a state school, which I'm having so much difficulty doing. I have a cousin here who is doing far better than me, internships and class wise(is in graduate courses in her undergrad degree somehow).

-A terrible person(I take and take and never really give, expect support and don't really give back)

-a constant fuckup(took a trip to california during which I practically did jack-all and embarassed myself and leeched again, failed two driving tests, nearly failed in getting into my major, have insane difficulty focusing in class so i keep missing assignments and rely on that friend for help, i keep making really stupid mistakes like I almost lost my friends keys to his apartment while in California and had to contact uber to get it back, I bought a bus ticket to and from the wrong place the other day so I'm out another $30, going on a family trip during which I have an exam that I said I'd take care of but now the professor is telling me he can't arrange for it though I've already booked a $1000 ticket. I keep forgetting my things in places. Not doing so well in my classes this semester,etc.. ALSO, i chose my roommate this year which was a terrible mistake, BUT i signed a lease with him and that disciplined friend, and a few other friends/people to live in a house next year. I really don't know...

-My family is relying on me. My dad keeps calling me to say like he failed me and that he needs me to take him out of this hole, etc.. but I can't bear to tell him whats been going on with me. He thinks everything is fine. My mom has been through so much and supports me and she knows but I can tell her patience is running out on me.


**I seriously need help.**";6;"Stop comparing yourself to others.

Start fixing your issues, one at a time. Don't try to fix them all at once, it's too much. Make a plan. Get a journal or a notebook. Make a list of all your issues, and behind them write down your plan of how to fix each of them. Doesn't have to work the first time, just try again if it falls. It's only true failure if you give up. If the steps are so big they seem impossible, break then down into smaller steps until they seem doable. 

- depression and anxiety. If medication doesn't help try a few other things. Exercise, walking, meditation, healthy diet (lots of vegetables, very limited sugar, no processed foods, cook from scratch), and make sure you get enough sleep, and good quality sleep. Therapy. Different medication. Better balance between activity and relaxing. Add a books to read list in the journal ND set aside time to read them (if you do a lot of driving, or commuting get  audiobooks!)

- school. Learn how to study and plan the studying so you don't have to do everything at once, divide the load so it is spread out evenly. Ask your friend how (s)he does this since they sound organized (or read How to be a straight a student by Cal Newport, and watch some study channels on YouTube for tips. Find what works for you, so you can keep up the good gpa even when the material is new, without drowning.) Pomodoro system for productivity works well.
Write a daily/weekly to do list in the journal/notebook. Check out /r/bulletjournal for fancy examples. Not just for studying but everything you plan to do that day. Start slow or it will be discouraging (if it's too much to do and you can't finish all). Check mark or cross off what's done. Feels good! Write down stuff you're forgetting now too. Pay a little more attention to what you're doing when it comes to the other mistakes? Try to fix what you can (refund ticket/try again to move exam date?)

- stop leeching from family/friends. Find a part time job and put at a limit for yourself on how much you are willing to take, or just take all they're willing to give you, but save it all you so you'll have an emergency fund for next year. Nothing wrong with living at your uncle's place by the way, just earn your keep. If you don't (have to) pay rent offer to do so, or pay by cleaning up or cooking or do the shopping or take care of pets or.. You get the idea. Learn how to budget (/r/ynab) and avoid debt and manage your money, have some financial goals too that you can work toward. Write them in your journal and sit down to do your budgeting and goal tracking every Sunday. Add some life goals too. Places to go, things to do. What kind of person do you want to be? 

- not supporting family/friends. This may have to do with the anxiety and depression, where you have no mental or physical energy left for this? Start small, ask Can I do something for you. Or I'm going to the store, do you need anything? If it's the anxiety and depression this should automatically get better when that gets better.

Good luck, you can do it!

(Also filter out everything from your life that adds to the depression. TV series, people, things you do, and replace them with stuff that helps. Don't hesitate to ask your family and friends on what they think you should do to fix this, they may have some valuable input! Try what they say, of it works great, if it doesn't, try something else).";9;1.5;[[0.93622122]];[[0.52403861]];-0.7907;0.11800000000000001;0.7440000000000001;0.139;0.9549;0.111;0.805;0.084;-0.04800000000000002;-0.1124514374514374;0.1301112436316518;-0.2425626810830892

**I seriously need help.**";6;"Hey man. I understand a little of what you're going through, and yeah, it sucks pretty bad. 

One thing you really need to do is learn to love yourself. Granted, this is a lifelong struggle and no one is really perfect, but it sounds like you're out and out ""ahhhh gawd why did I do that"" ""kill me plz"" feeling so low you could drown in a puddle kind of days. 

Look man--- some people are practically geared towards self destruction. From toxic relationships, porn, masturbation, etc., to drugs/drinking/alcohol to even overredditting and gaming, chronic eating, hell, we even self-harm. How did it all get so backasswards?

Look man, this is tough to put into practice, but you need to love yourself. You're never going to grow out of what you're in right now if you're in constant state of self loathing. You need to be sincerely at peace with who you are.

#1: Define yourself. What are you trying to be? what are your goals in life? These are the things that matter to YOU. At the beginning of every test, every exam, every paper, write your core values at the top. You have in mind the ideal you're striving for as you work. 

#2. Distance yourself from the situation. If you're in a moment of temptation, dont' say ""I'm weak"". You can justify any failure if you bitch about just being human and hey, we can't help that, can we? No. You're experiencing weakness in the moment. This moment will pass and you can remain true to your values. If you can stay strong for this moment, you can stay strong for the next minute. If you can live up to a minute, you can do ten. If you can replicate that ten, you've got a good thing going. You can replicate these moments of strength. 

And I've gotta go, so ending this for now. Sorry I couldn't say more. But I hope this helps man. Just know that there are people out there that care about you and want to see you succeed. Granted you might never meet em, but we're out here all the same. Best of luck my dude!

**I seriously need help.**";6;"The stress of trying too hard to succeed can cause you to fail.

Seriously.

My last experience with this came as I was learning to drive manual and found myself stalling out more frequently when there were people behind me at a red light. The pressure of getting out of the way when that light turned green made it more likely I'd mess up. 

So what do you do?

**Chill for a moment.** Think about what you need to do and do it. Go for the low-hanging fruit first. Build a baseline of good habits and success. 

**Start turning to people for help.** Your family is relying on you, but you can rely on them too. And honestly, if they're going through problems of their own they might actually *appreciate* the ability to focus on your problems instead for a while. Work together to lift each other up and relate to each other. 

**Make your responsibilities VISUAL.** Use a planner, and it doesn't even have to be an official planner- regular paper in a binder can work just the same, my dude.  I've got a big-ass dry erase board calendar on my wall and I just bought a cork board to hang up next to it where I can pin things I need to do and put up reminders. I also carry a daily schedule with me in my pocket every day, set reminders for easy shit on my phone, write stuff on my hand, etc. It helps tremendously.";2;0.33333333333333337;[[0.92406559]];[[0.49061962]];-0.7907;0.11800000000000001;0.7440000000000001;0.139;0.6506;0.094;0.8170000000000001;0.08900000000000001;-0.026000000000000027;-0.1124514374514374;0.10111111111111112;-0.21356254856254853

**I seriously need help.**";6;"Let me tell you something. 

I got a new job to make more money. I just recently used a spreadsheet to keep track of my expenses. Over Jan &amp; Feb I overspent by a good amount, using savings that I shouldn’t. It was a big wake up call. You’re not a leech, you just need goals, discipline and a plan. 

I didn’t get the grades I wanted at university. With the grades I got, it’s pretty hard to get a good graduate role in a law firm and I really let it knock my confidence. But I got a role and qualified as a lawyer 2 Years now. I worked really hard to get a lot of experience to compensate for my grades. I had no excuses or mitigating circumstances to use in interviews. I had to find other ways to not let my failures outshine me. 

If you think you don’t give back - volunteer. This will help with your experience and eventually landing a role for paid work. Your contributions at home or in society don’t have to be monetary and they don’t have to be grand. 

I fuck up at work. It happens. I take responsibility and deal with it. Example: I have clients who I have been going back and forth with regarding an application to be signed for 3 months. I sent back one document a few weeks ago because I made a mistake on the document.  I got it back TODAY and realised I made another mistake.  I also had to take the brunt of a clients complaint because of issues with changes at work and previous colleagues, including something I forwarded to the complaints department 6 weeks ago. 

You’re being way to hard on yourself. Recognise that you are trying and if you’re not trying, do something about it. You can definitely turn things around for the better. Start with something small and keep going.

[NeedAdvice] - How do I reduce apathy and gain a sense of urgency?;t3_80n7il;5;"Hey everyone; I suppose the title could be phrased as ""how do I gain motivation"" but I don't think motivation is the right word. I'll preface this by saying that apathy is often put together with depression - I've certainly had a ""phase"" of it but after various therapies, CBT, lifestyle changes and seeing others with it I'm sure it's very mild if not just something else.

Generally speaking I just do what feels good with some good habits in there. I run for 5km 3x a week. I do well at college being the top of my class (albeit very close or just after deadlines), I sometimes meditate and/or read but that tends to come and go. I intermittently fast (eat at 12pm and 6pm).

I also experimented with cutting out video games which I've recently added back in with moderation, and I don't smoke and while I do drink, it's very occasionally and not to a level I'm not lucid. 

The issue is that I lack a sense of urgency - I don't see myself as important somehow. I try to wake up at 7am every morning, and it works whenever I have an obligation or am meeting someone, but as soon as the entire day is free I'll happily lay in bed awake and aware until lunch. When I have a bath I'll take hours. I'm never really motivated(?) to start projects and I'm feeling pretty stuck. I don't even know what I want, and when I have a vague idea I'll probably not pursue it.

What helps the most is being in a relationship - I find a lot of value and fulfilment in improving myself or doing things when in my head it's for my partner. That sort of dependency is awful when the relationships stop working out and is just something I'd like to change. I want to be single for a while and focus on myself, but I'll probably throw the time away if nothing changes. I'm also really good at solving problems and taking action for friends to help them out.

Tldr; I can easily do things for other people (Relationships, deadlines, friends, parents) but not for myself. I don't care about myself like I would another person I'm close to, and I have no idea what I want to do most of the time when I'm alone so I just waste the time.

If you could give someone you care about a good life, whatever that means to you, in a year or two, what would that look like? Do that. You can't give anyway if you have nothing to give.

[NeedAdvice] - How do I reduce apathy and gain a sense of urgency?;t3_80n7il;5;"Hey everyone; I suppose the title could be phrased as ""how do I gain motivation"" but I don't think motivation is the right word. I'll preface this by saying that apathy is often put together with depression - I've certainly had a ""phase"" of it but after various therapies, CBT, lifestyle changes and seeing others with it I'm sure it's very mild if not just something else.

Generally speaking I just do what feels good with some good habits in there. I run for 5km 3x a week. I do well at college being the top of my class (albeit very close or just after deadlines), I sometimes meditate and/or read but that tends to come and go. I intermittently fast (eat at 12pm and 6pm).

I also experimented with cutting out video games which I've recently added back in with moderation, and I don't smoke and while I do drink, it's very occasionally and not to a level I'm not lucid. 

The issue is that I lack a sense of urgency - I don't see myself as important somehow. I try to wake up at 7am every morning, and it works whenever I have an obligation or am meeting someone, but as soon as the entire day is free I'll happily lay in bed awake and aware until lunch. When I have a bath I'll take hours. I'm never really motivated(?) to start projects and I'm feeling pretty stuck. I don't even know what I want, and when I have a vague idea I'll probably not pursue it.

What helps the most is being in a relationship - I find a lot of value and fulfilment in improving myself or doing things when in my head it's for my partner. That sort of dependency is awful when the relationships stop working out and is just something I'd like to change. I want to be single for a while and focus on myself, but I'll probably throw the time away if nothing changes. I'm also really good at solving problems and taking action for friends to help them out.

Tldr; I can easily do things for other people (Relationships, deadlines, friends, parents) but not for myself. I don't care about myself like I would another person I'm close to, and I have no idea what I want to do most of the time when I'm alone so I just waste the time.

Edit: Thank you so much for the thoughtful responses! This advice was so helpful!";18;"First thing is, that you're developing and maturing, recognizing there are things you want to improve on.  That self-work is part of the solution.  

I had a lot of things working against me but I saw others who have been through the same or worse, and I saw them lose it, but regain their composure and rise from the tragedies and defeats and I kept thinking they're stronger than me.  

I think the best therapy when a person is going through this is to do things, but be pragmatic about them, yes you'll feel bad, but that is part of it, the fear will come up, but you will identify what is triggering that fear the more familiar you become with it.  You can't really control everything, but putting yourself out there more often will build up awareness of self.  

Particularly if you find something worth doing or trying to have that is pushing you outside your safety/comfort zone, even if it doesn't work out or go smoothly you will have learned.  

The only thing you really need to train yourself to do is to keep re-exposing yourself because when I had this deep-seated fears controlling me, I just wanted to stay away long enough to forget the bad stuff ever happened and curl up into a ball literally and figuratively.  

In the end I realised those whom I thought were ""stronger"" than I what they had, whether it was that they really were stronger or not, it didn't matter.  What mattered was to continue getting back up because my inclination in life for most of my youth was to be cynical and pessimistic.  Hell, I'm still those things, but I'm aware of it, and I'm also aware of what needs to be done and when I won't like something, but need to make myself do it anyway even if I'm not all in.    

Right now I'm in a new country and I feel the anxiety when I do new things, when I go places outside of my comfort zone, of what I prefer and what I'm used to.  I feel the dread and hear myself saying ""why am I doing this, why do I keep ending up like this"",  ""I'll never want to do this again"".  But I keep myself from popping off and know it will come to an end like most things.  Eventually I rest from the anxiety the best I can, and re-examine the thing that was making me anxious and I realise it was good experience because I did it and know if I do it again, it won't be as bad because I have fore-knowledge and sensory data in my system.  

The big dilemma is trusting yourself, because we go through phases where whatever we feel about a situation or what we experienced felt as though it would always be that way and that it would never get better, and often that it would worsen.  

I have come to the personal realization that the old worn out cliche, ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" is true and ever present.  Whether we're aware of it or not, because the effects can be seemingly microscopic sometimes.  Not one of us can experience anything without it changing us in someway.  We as entities always gain from experience in some way.  It's just that whatever our life circumstances, that may not necessarily feel like it's enough that we finally feel like we've accomplished something, especially in light of the relatively lofty heights we need to achieve to live in this world oftentimes.

Edit: Thank you so much for the thoughtful responses! This advice was so helpful!";18;"Although I do not have experience with anxiety and any other mental illnesses for that matter, I think I do have some advice that might help you. 

You mentioned how your brain refuses to believe you when you do positive self talk, which is totally fine. The thing with self talk is, that it is not a magical cure and at first you will not believe it, it takes time. I would compare it to writing a code for a computer program, for it to work, one line of code is not enough. You need many-many lines of code, and then you need to run it and test it to see if it works, most often than not it always needs some adjustments and changes made.  I have improved my own self-image and confidence so much with self talk and believe me, I thought the things I said at first were ridiculous, but now I have 'brainwashed' myself to actually believing it. It's amazing. 

 Another thing is that you know some things logically, but you still feel fear and anxiety about these things. I would call these negative beliefs and I can give you a formula I used to change mine, but again, keep in mind that in order to shift your beliefs you need to read and say these things continiously for a period of time. 
So: 1. Write out the negative belief you have (I do not trust myself driving); 2. Write out why it is just a story in your head, and not real facts (I went through driving school, I have a permit, I have never crashed a car, I know how traffic works etc); 3. Write a new story in present tense and first person (I am a good driver and I am not scared of driving in traffic, because I have the necessary skills.. etc) 
This is what helped me to change my thinking and become more confident and optimistic as a person. I hope it does for you, too.

I stopped slacking off in school when I made a rule for myself to do all the work at school and go home when it was done. So for example on one day classes end at 2pm. I'd stay till 5 pm to complete the homework I needed to do for those classes and then go home. That way, my evenings were truly mine. 

Also, before classes start, review the coursework so you can ask specific questions during class instead of having to ask them when you get home and have to actually work through the material.

Lastly, listen attentively. This saves SO much time. I used to sit in class passively waiting for it to end because I could always look it up later. Guess what I never did...

Actually paying attention to what your profs are telling you saves you study time. It's a no-brainer but you'd be surprised how many people just handle studying like they could do it through osmosis.

I need to really get my shit together and stop this. What can I do?;120;"I feel like I went through the same thing as you. For me, it took failing hard to get my act together. I still struggle with not backsliding. A lot of times I know I can coast and get by but if I just put in any real effort the results would be so much better. So I choose to coast because it's a habit and easy. It isn't easy to change, I'm going to guess that you're probably pretty smart. You've never really had to work to succeed at anything and if you failed you quit because life let you get away with that and you believe that failure is bad. It's good that you realize now that you need to get your shit together before the stakes are higher. I think the turning point for me was not just my major failure but also realizing that I couldn't just quit to avoid further failure like I always did. I was forced to go back and try again and again until I succeeded.

I think the thing to do is to change your perspective on failure. Allow yourself to fail. Push yourself so that you have more opportunities to fail, which also means you have more opportunities for success. Failure should lead to learning and ultimately more future success. The only failure that is unacceptable is quitting. I think a lot of smart people don't live up to their full potential because of the fear of failure. So embrace failure.

Having a child also helped for me. I want to do better for my kid and set a good example. I don't recommend running out and making a baby just so you can do better in school but maybe find someone you care about that you want to do better for. Check in with that person and also with yourself to make sure you are always on track. 

The truth is, you don't have to stop bullshitting and you can probably get by pretty well in life by coasting. If you do though you're missing out on a lot more that life can offer you.

[NeedAdvice] How do I stop bullshitting college?;t3_7yqyrc;22;Pretty much all my life I bullshitted my way through school. In high school, I've taken mostly honors and AP classes and during that time I've barely ever studied, really only ever on the day of the tests, I've never really read, a lot of the time I wouldn't do homework, and I did all essays and projects at the last minute. I ended high school with a 2.9. Currently, I'm taking my second freshman semester at Community College. I got by with a 3.2 getting 9 credits by bullshitting everything up until it required me to put in actual effort. I would turn assignments, needed to be handed in to prevent me from failing, in late. Luckily, my professors excused my bullshit and allowed me to turn in late assignments with minimal penalties. I plan on transferring and I know every good school is very competitive with their GPA. I need to really get my shit together and stop this. What can I do?;120;Do you feel like you have any focus/attention issues? Struggles with time management? Your college may have some staff to help you with strategies to improve. Look to see what student services are offered. Many universities (not 100% sure about community colleges) have learning support centers/tutoring centers/etc. with staff you can talk to that will help you overcome these challenges. If it may be a diagnosable issue such as ADD/ADHD, campus resources can point you in the right direction to get help for that, too. ;2;0.016666666666666666;[[0.9252444]];[[0.47372201]];0.4818;0.107;0.8170000000000001;0.077;0.9399;0.20600000000000002;0.768;0.026000000000000002;-0.15;0.08766666666666664;0.3214285714285714;-0.23376190476190475

To help you kickboost that I would highly recommend checking out Cal Newport's books. Pick the one that resonates most with you (he has a ""How to"" series for students and colleges but his more recent books are really solid as well)

Save maybe operating on someone's brain.  

Besides that, it is extremely logical that you have out zero effort in, becsuse if you have half a brain, you can give zero effort for 4 years and still walk out with a diploma and good GPA.  

College is a joke for many reasons, which I don't go into now.  Some people say the real world is nothing like college and you had BETTER change your behavior, or else!!  Lol. 

Come on.  These are the people who believe everything they hear, never make waves, and post pictures of their cat on social media.  The real world is exactly like college.  Bullshit abounds.  Just like you learned to successfully bullshit your way through college, you can do the same with the rest of life.  The vast majority of people are stupid.  Legitimately, testably stupid.  Have you TALKED to some of the people you sit by in class? Yeah, gets worse in the real world becsuse these people get this high and mighty feeling that they are getting a paycheck becsuse they are SMART.  No.  The vast majority of people you are going to be working with are lower than average intelligence. 

All you have to know is how the business world system works, how to do your job efficiently and get paid, and you're back to coasting just like now in college.  

When you finally find something actually INTERESTING, you will never ever have to address this problem again.  You will dive headlong into the subject and think about it day and night.  You will teach yourself everything you want to know on the subject and look for other resources to fill in your gaps in knowledge. 

But why aren't you doing this in College, the place where all Americans are supposed to figure out what they want to do?  Because the government run bullshit schools, tenured professors who don't give a fuck, and below standard teaching methods and a lack of actual USEABLE skills you learn make going to college an absolute joke.

First thing to do is determine what is required. (That is your first sub task). If you do not know what is expected, then you have no clear goal or set of requirements to address.
Small chunk one, is to read requirements for a project, and what is expected in order to pass that project.
Always set a deadline for your sub task, and if it seems overwhelming, break that subtask into even smaller sub-projects.

Once you know what it is that is expected of you, find out what the minimum effort path is to meet those requirements.

What is your major? What was your favorite class?
What is the requirement of the project? Is it a survey? Original research? Is it a review of a topic? Can it be done in a lab? 

Without knowing what it is you need to do, you cannot find out what to do, and you will be aimless.

You continuously refining and ""perfecting"" things is the 80% of your efforts that only *may* result in the extra 20% of your results.

There are a few things you can do.

Set limits as to how many times you can edit something, so say 2 or 3 go throughs.

Before you even do this, be very thorough with the material you already have.

What is the truly important and beneficial parts? Which isn't as useful or doesn't add much to the argument?

Ruthlessly cut away all of that and this will save you more time with less to edit etc.

I need to publish everything I have in the next few months...even if it is not great, it needs to be good enough. ";21;"Your situation is incredibly similar to mine. I am also in the last stretch of my PhD and the past year I had to submit several journal papers on my research, which took much more time than anticipated due to anxiety-driven procrastination. Deadlines used to motivate me in the past but they didn't for anymore for the past year. Instead they exhausted me and filled me with dread. I felt an overwhelming amount of guilt because I was not meeting them, which made matters only worse. Eventually I also had to deal with physical symptoms: a constant tiredness, tense muscles, upset stomach, tension headaches, ... which also did not help much of course.

For me, the ""trick"" to break out of the procrastination loop was to realize that I felt paralyzed due to the overwhelming number of choices that I had to deal with that are involved with creative work, such as writing a paper. Studying was easy for me because the work is clear-cut: e.g. ""here are 200 pages and you have to read the pages until you understand the material"". That is very easy. But with writing you have to makes hundreds of decisions: ""what is the scope of the paper"", ""which experiments do I include"", ""how do I explain this concept best"". If you are a perfectionist then these decisions can be very challenging and you tend to avoid them.

What I started doing was to very consciously and ruthlessly make decisions, not allowing myself too much time to make them, and most importantly follow through on them. I am talking about decisions on a very short time span (30 minutes - 1 hour). For example: ""I want to explain a certain concept in a paragraph"" or ""I have to include and describe a figure"". I decide it needs to be done and will make tiny decisions about it, pushing through the emotional barrier, until it is completed. 

What also helped with my writer's anxiety is to imagine myself writing or talking to a student instead of to myself. The student only needs to know the essentials about a certain concept, whereas my inner critic will never be satisfied unless I explain something perfectly.

But I’ll add my little extra juice as well. I had the same problem as you. I was paralyzed by perfection. I wouldn’t start things because I’d be afraid id not do it perfectly. So then things would pile up and I’d feel like shit. 

So I started looking at 80/20 like this: I’d rather complete something and have it only be 80% good than 100% incomplete. Fuck perfection. If I can just get something to 80%, im good.

[Need advice] How to be faster and meet deadlines, when deadlines make me super anxious and parallize me?;t3_83e1n2;4;"Hello everyone. I have been very depressed recently. I am about to finish my PhD (knock on wood) already doing final polishing on my dissertation. Due to this stress being more or less removed from my life, I started introspecting and I feel very ashamed about everything taking so long in my life academically and professionally. 
My professor told me I have ""more than enough"" content and this made me think I am really overdoing it putting enormous effort, while at the same time always taking much longer than necessary to finish stuff. When i have to do something fast, I get very anxious and parallized and cannot do it at all. How do I start meeting deadlines without being worried that content is not perfect and without overdoing things? I have done this in highschool, bachelor, masters and now PhD. I really want to improve professionally, but cant seem to be able to get the fast pace going. I need to redo things several times until i feel confident and so on. Now finally I have some good research and desperately need to publish it ASAP, but am worried that I will again get into the anxiety - perfectionism-procrastination loop. I need to publish everything I have in the next few months...even if it is not great, it needs to be good enough. ";21;"What's your course?

";115;"I can at least tell you how I'm doing it. One word. Consistency.

I established a morning routine, and the first few things I do as soon as i get up are - Make my bed, Meditate for 10 minutes, Exercise for 20-30 minutes, Make breakfast and lunch for work, and then write for one hour. After that, I go to work.

I've done this consistently for over 100 days, and let me tell ya, its life altering. I've lost weight, I get more things done, and the momentum generated in the morning carries me throughout the day.

There have been a few instances of roommates trying to get me to change my morning routines in favor of them. I did no such thing. I didn't compromise. Every day, whether it be a weekday or a weekend, I wake up at 4:30 and get up to turn off my alarm (I put my alarm all the way on the other side of the room at a tall height that will force me to get up) and then get to work.

You gotta create the correct habits. Your brain adapts and creates new neural pathways for all the things you do, so if you create a routine and consistently stick to it in an uncompromising attitude, then eventually, with time, the responses become automatic and much easier to maintain. But if you start new routines and then drop out of them, you'll fall back on your strongest habits.

";115;"We're not robots, we do need a sense of novelty and change in our lives otherwise if we did the same shit day in day out we would get bored.

So there's two main ways of dealing with this:

1. Make the mundane interesting
2. Switch shit up

(1) Means going about the way you do things in a slightly different way or with a different focus. It's noticing the things you DON'T normally notice or seeing them in a different way. 

So if you go for runs regularly, focus on different sensations in your body, sounds, or thoughts you have.

If at the gym, then focus on building a stronger mind muscle connection and really experiencing the muscle contract and relax. 

(2) Switching shit up is just what it sounds like, switch shit up! 

You don't have to do the same disciplined routine the rest of your life, you're allowed to change it up to another disciplined routine. And the change doesn't have to be anything hectic!

Say for example your morning routine, you can simply change the order of the normal things you do.

If it's brushing teeth then showering then meditating then journalling, you could instead shower then brush teeth then journal and then meditate.

It's small and simple but it can and does make a difference. 

The other thing that relates to (1) is re-assessing how this boring mundane stuff DOES lead to long-term rewards and satisfaction.

Hope I can find some advise in the comments, and I am happy to answer any questions or conversations in the comments. ";6;"First: I agree with the advice to give up/get rid of whatever you game on. Make some friends and you can hang out and game with them, but maybe leave your console/PC at home so you have it during breaks. 

Second: Talk to the prof. I taught college classes and yes, we know bullshit when we hear it. Go to the prof's office hours, lay it out and say you're sorry you've missed, but you've been in a tough spot mentally and you're ready to come back. Find out if there's a mandatory attendance policy -- some departments require an automatic fail if you miss a percentage of classes. If not, *go to every class from this day forward.*

But, if you find out you've already missed too many classes and you're going to fail automatically, *go to class anyway.* If you show up and engage, he might fail you with a C (depends on if he can, as some in-major courses require a C or higher to pass, so he can mercy-kill you with a C- without tanking your GPA.) If he's still required to fail you with a D or more, you'll have to take the class again, and that will be markedly easier after you've already taken it. 

You need to think of classes as your job. If you put in 40hrs/week, you can get decent grades and still have time to socialize, play games, etc. But don't go back to games until you trust yourself to be disciplined and until you know you won't drop the ball.

It's up to you. Why are you not going to class? Is it because you don't have to? Maybe you should consider online classes so you can participate when you feel like it and where you feel like it instead of a more traditional structured approach? If you lie, realize first that every professor has heard every excuse before. You're more likely get help if you're apologetic, contrite, and demonstrate a change by continuing to attend class for the remainder of the semester. You have almost nothing to gain from making something up - and anything they'd give you a pass on would likely require outlandish proof. Whatever you do, do it during the professor's specified office hours. Make an appointment if required. Don't expect much sympathy, but they may give you a plan to pass the class if you complete the rest of the courseload work successfully. 

&gt;2) How to prevent this in the future and get disciplined enough to begin attending all my classes.

Attend classes. Pick times that you're likely to attend. Select online classes if you prefer a more customized attendance pattern. What are you doing that's distracting you from attending class? 

Whatever it is, realize that in 10 years, you'll look back and WISH you were going to class instead of doing that. 

I was you once. I had no goal or career in mind when I attended my first 2 years of college. I didn't go to class, I wasted time on a variety of hobbies - I wasted my tuition and college fund on nothing. After dropping out, working without a degree for 5 years doing jobs that all eventually presented a glass ceiling, I found myself miserable, broke, and overworked (and underpaid.) 

THERE IS NO MAGIC SOLUTION FOR UNSKILLED WORKERS. Go to college, or go to trade school - but to do nothing but work entry level jobs and _hope_ for promotion? No. That's fantasy and 90% of everyone that follows that path is unable to succeed. Additionally, if you find a path to uncommon success, there' no backup plan if that industry disappears. 

Decide WHY your going to college. Realize how much competition there will be in the job industry if you don't stand out from the people in the same classroom as you for your major. 

I found my niche several years later and went back. It took my a while due to working full time and other complications. It's worth the effort, but it's also very, very hard. 

&gt;I really need to turn this around before its too late in the semester and I end up on academic probation or possibly worse.

Now that I've scared you, there are lights at the end of the tunnel. This semester won't be your best. If you fail a class, determine if your school has a ""forgiveness"" policy. If so, you can re-take the class and they'll modify the original grade based on what your new grade is (my college allowed a limited, specific number of retakes, one per course, for my entire academic career and they would overwrite the lower grade.) 

""C's get degrees"". If you're going into a profession where grades aren't that competitive (non-engineering, non-medical, etc) - your goal is to pass the class, not master the content. You SHOULD master the content if it's part of your major, because it'll keep coming back up, but you can squeak by if you get a C. 

Many colleges have assignments and course content designed to be forgiving to poor test-takers. If you complete _all_ of the non-test assignments with the _best possible grade_, you may be able to squeak by on the exam (even fail it) and still pass the class. I've seen some courses where the entirety of the grade is based solely on exam grades and a semester long project, so read the syllabus on day 1 and find out how the class is organized. **tl;dr** DON'T SKIP ANY ASSIGNMENTS. THEY'RE YOUR SAFETY NET. And frankly, if you complete the assignments and perform highly on them, you're well-prepared for the exams. There are online resources you can Google up on your own to assist you with understanding the material if your professor is teaching the class in a way that you don't quite follow. 

As for being smart - all that does is to help you understand the information that the instructor is teaching. It may even mean you require less outside assistance when completing the assignments. (For me, that was English/Lit/Philosophy and Business-based classes.) For those classes, you may ""get"" the material while others struggle to understand it without help, tutoring, or reading the material extensively. For me, that was accounting classes, programming, and advanced mathematics (Calculus..) 

Let me know if any of this helps at all or if you have more questions. I've been you - I wish I was you with the knowledge I have now, I'd/we'd do things very differently.

**[NeedAdvice]** College Student Who doesn't go to class;t3_7x633n;7;"**[NeedAdvice]** 
I am not really sure how to start this (considering this is my first ever Reddit post) - I am a college student in my second semester of sophomore year and I have barley been any classes this semester and while I start my fourth week of classes I have a test in a class that I have yet to even go to. I am not able to drop or withdraw from this class so I am looking for:

1) advice on what to tell my professor considering I am enrolled in his class and have yet to come. Do I lie and make a reason for never showing up or do I be honest?
2) How to prevent this in the future and get disciplined enough to begin attending all my classes. 

I know I am smart enough to pass all the classes I take I just am so lazy and procrastinate on everything then end up deciding to skip classes and most of my assignments. I really need to turn this around before its too late in the semester and I end up on academic probation or possibly worse.

You might take a year off, get a job and see what it’s like to not have that degree.

Skipping classes just to sleep in and play video games 12 hours a day. When they found out I was cut off and left to fend for myself. After 10 years of physical labor jobs, I have only just recently found an opportunity to go back to school, albeit still working full time and being a single parent.

The belief in being an *unmotivated person* is the root of your lack of intrinsic motivation, and as with all limiting beliefs can be challenged and altered.

Motivation and discipline dovetail, necessarily. If you're motivated without discipline, you're stuck with inaction; if you're disciplined without motivation, you'll burn out. Why do or want anything if you haven't got a good reason? What's your motivation for wanting to screw around later, for example?

What do you actually want? If you had all the time and money in the world to run through your hedonistic desires, what would you do afterwards? What impact or understanding do you want to have? Apathy and complacency won't make you happy, and I think it's safe to presume you're posting here because you want something like happiness, or perhaps an escape from suffering. But *escape from suffering* is clearly distinguished from *freedom from suffering*.

Realize you're the owner of your experience. If you can't take responsibility for your life you won't ever see that you're the only one holding yourself back.

Spend time seriously contemplating your desires and wishes for both the present and the future. What do you want? What part of your experience do you wish were otherwise? This is the only way you'll find *actual* intrinsic motivation.

This attitude changed when I was able to do one thing and see improvement over time - I lost 35 pounds in 8 months, by just consistently logging my food habits daily. This taught me the valuable lesson that a- I can do things ! b-consistency is the key .. 
so what I’d recommend based on my experience is - pick up any one thing you want to change in or improve on. Do it consistently everyday for a month, or 2 months, track your progress every single day, and at the end, look at your progress.

Tl:dr -- Try getting actual life experience before you consider yourself forever unmotivated.  School isn't that stimulating sometimes and family can be annoying af. If you're still feeling shitty after exploring for a bit check back in with us lol. 

You sound pretty set on college, and that's fine, but consider getting some work experience first if you haven't yet and get a better sense of who you are. I fucking hated high school and felt lost in my first few years of college. I knew I was smart, talented and whatever but it felt pointless because there wasn't anything I felt like I gave enough fucks about. I found out I was depressed and life started getting a little better but I still felt I didn't have a good sense of who I was and what I wanted to do. Long story short, some drama went down and I got sick of the bullshit at home so I ran away to live in the woods for 6 months with 16 other strangers and build trails. No internet or phone the entire time. I learned way more about myself there than I did in college. I'm not saying you have to do something that extreme, but I got a better sense of who I am through real hard work and having no where to hide from it more than I did doing bullshit at school that didn't have real world consequences. 

Having all my bullshit conveniences and possessions stripped away in the woods helped me realize that all I actually need to be content is to be warm, dry, well-fed and in good company after a hard day of meaningful work. I figured out later that it felt meaningful not just because building trails is a public service that hardly anyone wants to do, but because I knew I was pulling my weight on my crew and people could count on me to get shit done. I got a similar sense of satisfaction recently working as a designer at a printing company (until I got stabbed in the back lol) and when I played rugby in college (until I fucked up my shoulder). 

The last two things didn't work out for long but I discovered that the common theme was that I thrived on a team that I felt I could contribute to. For me, solo work just isn't that fulfilling. In the woods, I found out that I was pretty good with hand tools and moving big ass rocks. At the printing company I optimized my work flow and kicked the design queue's ass. In rugby, I was a rookie and wasn't the most skilled but I found it fun af and I was surrounded by bad ass chicks that I got along with. I helped the team in other ways by being a driver to tournaments or designing shit for fundraisers. The type of work was less relevant as long as I felt like I was making life easier for the team in some capacity.

I'm back in school finishing up a degree I got stuck with because I was indecisive as fuck and switched my major 3 times before I had my stint in the woods. Right now I feel like shit because I'm studying crap I don't really care about working for free at an internship I don't care about either. I'm living off loans and spent the last 3 days procrastinating and barely got out of the house at all. But you know what, this shitty part of my life where I feel like a lazy POS doesn't define me.  I know it will pass soon and I'm gonna find a new place to be useful as fuck, and knowing that helps me get back on track.

Honestly typing this response is helping me get out of this funk right now. Thanks for asking questions that helped me to reflect in a constructive way. Even if you end up finding this reply stupid and think I'm full of shit, I feel better just knowing that I gave enough fucks to try to help someone who's in a similar situation, cuz like I said, I don't do well if I feel like the only person I'm helping is myself. I've been in bed doing nothing for the past 5 hours but I'm gonna get the fuck up now lol, thanks!

When you do that, people will see you as motivated. They will ask you what motivates you, and you'll answer with some words that sound good to you.

[NeedAdvice] Is it okay that I have never been intrinsically motivated and I will most likely never have motivation?;t3_7wfco3;27;Honestly, I don’t feel motivated. Ever. I do not care about how I do in school, I do not care about sucking up to my parents’ demands, I do not care about where I go to college, or if I will have a fulfilling career, or where I want to be in x number of years. I only care because others tell me too. That’s why I’m on this sub. Motivation is bullshit. Discipline is what I need to be successful. Doing well in school, going to a good university, finding a fulfilling career, and volunteering my time does not make me happy. I do these things because they are expected me. Not because I intrinsically want them. So I figured I’ll need a little bit of discipline now so I can get fuck-off money and screw around later.;127;"If you actually had that fuck-around money, would you do something you actually care about, or would you burn out your nervous system trying to drown out your apathy?

Thinking about your phone or distractions happen to everyone and it just takes patience and kindness to yourself in order to improve (which meditation will help with).  Just allow the thought to happen, observe the thought, and gently nudge it out of focus.  Don't stress out about it.  Be curious about what you're distracted with and why you're thinking about it (instead of what sounds like you know you should be doing).

We all need a sense of significance and connection to other people, it's just a matter of where and how we're going to get that. If we're surrounded by others who are geting it all from insta selfies and travelling and taking cool pics, we will automatically default to thinking that's the way to go about achieving it.

But the truth is there are myriads of ways to go about it, we all just need to expand our horizons and go outside of our normal sphere of influence to see how and in what ways we can do it.

The important thing is to find the thing that does genuinely bring you a sense of satisfaction rather than an empty feeling that only lasts a little while until you need to go chasing after the next thing again.

Until we plug ourselves out of the norm we're essentially sheeple following the herd and where the crowd goes.

It seems like you've swallowed the red pill now though and there's no turning back. Now it's time to decondition yourself and build yourself back up to figure out who you actually are and what you actually want to do.

Not what others tell you or show you what you should be doing, but what it is that brings you genuine satisfaction and ultimately what you were put on this Earth to do.

That's all on you to figure it out and it doesn't happen in an instance but that's the magic of this journey we call life.

It sounds like you have priorities but aren’t able to make them actionable. The path to change starts with one change. You can easily overwhelm yourself with all the things you wish to accomplish. For this reason you should focus on either eliminating or replacing ONE bad habit or adding ONE keystone habit. A keystone habit is a habit that’ll cascade overtime into new positive habits and healthier lifestyle. Considering your list of things to you want to change about yourself, I’d recommend starting with meditation. Meditation is a strong keystone habit that’ll change other areas of your life positively. Meditation tends to be overplayed to put it simply you’re just observing your thought, focusing on living in the moment, and concentrating on staying off trains of thought. This is like exercise for your mind and overtime find it easier to concentrate of other areas of your life since you’ve begun to get good at focusing on nothing. The best way to implement this change is to make it a habit. Your habits are structured in 3 steps a cue, the routine, the reward. I linked meditation to my coming home from work cue since that occurs almost everyday. Make this one small change and the rest will follow;5;0.625;[[0.96985211]];[[0.47757334]];0.9969;0.255;0.642;0.10400000000000001;0.9908;0.191;0.767;0.040999999999999995;0.0010000000000000286;0.08567033306829228;0.19750445632798572;-0.11183412325969347

Please help me.";8;"I feel that you are trying to get too many things done at once. Maybe you can try focusing on one or two things at a time. To deal with excuses, push yourself whenever an excuse pops into your mind. I would start with things like meditation and journaling, as they don't really have any learning curve and all they takes is time and instilling them as habits.

I understand the part about being eager for results but things such as coding, playing a guitar would require months and years of practice before becoming skilled (of course there are people who can pick them up quickly), you have to set aside some time everyday/weekly to practice them and you will eventually reap the rewards. Best if you can journal down your progress too! Then you will be doing both journaling and learning.

Please help me.";8;"Hello friend. I think what you need to do is to focus on the foundation goals first such as exercising more and waking up earlier. Concentrate on mastering the essentials for your goals and then slowly, 1 by 1 work on the harder things. To not procrastinate you have to have something in your mind that keeps you going just make sure it's NOT motivation (because we all know where that goes). Do you have anything of significance to you? A special person who inspires you? Perhaps something/someone you reflect upon every day. If you do, when you're trying your hardest to do something just keep reminding yourself of it and keep saying to yourself that ""regardless of if I stop I still tried today. Tomorrow I can go further and eventually I will achieve a goal no matter how small.""

If you really think about it, then society has gone completely mad, everyone racing for some sort of made up goal, living their life after some artificial ideal, deluding themselves that their work has actual meaning, all while this planet as we know it keeps edging closer toward its final straw. We are extremely overpopulated while all other species are shrinking, resources are dwindling, complete ecosystems are changing and/or dying out, and all of this because of our 'ambitions', of these 'goals', the various missions we force upon ourselves only to serve a machine that will cause our end. Maybe you are just too smart to take the bait and play this toxic game, one which ultimately won't serve anybody, yet you are probably scared of living differently, of choosing different values, because everyone is seemingly swimming in one direction, everyone being scared of falling behind in order to not be 'the one', the one that gets singled out and thus ends up lonely and ridiculed. It takes a lot of courage to swim against the current and to be a pioneer. And maybe that's exactly what you have to do. Most of this subreddit is incredibly streamlined in the ideas it offers. You are better off looking for answers somewhere else, off the screen, outside, and inside of yourself. ;2;0.5;[[0.93794547]];[[0.45233339]];-0.9922;0.092;0.706;0.20199999999999999;0.3415;0.069;0.867;0.064;-0.11500000000000002;-0.10249166542269993;0.024617346938775504;-0.12710901236147545

When you are walking along the street, looking out of your window or watching TV or playing a game, try to treasure something that catches your interest. Once you treasure it, remember it. Keeping thinking about it. When you think to yourself: ""Life is pretty shit what's the point"" You gotta be like: ""But in life that man dropped his sandwich outside my house"" 

You may think I am retarded. But trust me a man dropping his sandwich can mean a lot of things. You could think the following: I wonder what he had in his sandwich, tomato, cheese, lettuce? Was he on his way back home from work? Perhaps he was buying a sandwich for a homeless person. OH LOOK..... you just thought deeply about something. That must mean that somewhere in life there is a man who bought a sandwich, and then dropped it.

edit: It's not as if I don't have a goal or an ambition, It's my current circumstance that's stopping me from moving forward and I'm completely paralyzed right now, unable to do anything ";4;"I reflect on the transient nature of life to help me.

We have just one chance at living. Before this, we did not exist. After this, we will not exist. This is our *one* existence in the many billions of years the universe will be here. Of all the possible forms that life takes, that we are human and have consciousness and the ability to understand and experience and *choose* is nothing short of a miracle.

Being what we are is incredibly rare and precious, moreso than any precious jewel.

Death could come at any moment, there's no guarantee that we will live to see old age. Every single moment that we are alive is truly miraculous and full of potential. We don't have to do great or noble things because, even if we did, the universe wouldn't care. We can, however, live for ourselves and those we care about. We can enjoy *being here* and all the wonders that our senses can provide in this world.

There are so many wonderful things to see, smell, feel, taste, touch, hear, and understanding. Let's try to enjoy what we can, while we can. Let's not waste our time on things that don't serve us or that only bring us misery.

I love music and flowers and beautiful lights and other simple things like that. I don't have to be rich or influential to enjoy these things.

So, to go back to my original point: reflect deeply on the transient nature of our lives. Realize this fact of our existence as intensely as you can. Death comes for us all and can come at any moment and then our one life is over *forever*. So let's enjoy what we have while we have it :)";1;0.25;[[0.92781527]];[[0.53911378]];-0.9922;0.092;0.706;0.20199999999999999;0.9938;0.20800000000000002;0.73;0.062;-0.256;-0.10249166542269993;0.2890087853323147;-0.3915004507550146

This is it posed I saw and is pretty popular I hope it helps, number two and three will probably be more down your allie, since it seems having a hard time loving yourself.

""Ouch.  Sounds like you're having a tough time max.  That sucks.  I've been there, so I kinda know what you're talking about.  I've been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing.  It's no bueno.  I know.  If you don't mind lemme tell you a couple things.  You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it.  But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don't let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you're just letting us both down.  And you don't HAVE to do that.  You don't HAVE to do anything.  But you get to choose.

(Who am I?  My name’s Ryan and I live in Canada.  Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below.  I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me.  When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it’s a way of thanking them. )

Rule numero uno - There are no more zero days.  What's a zero day?  A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on.  No more zeros.  I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point.  The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system.  Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM?  Write one sentence.  One pushup.  Read one page of that chapter. One.  Because one is non zero.  You feel me?  When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that's what you're used to.  Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex.  It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS.  That's rule number one.  Do not forget.

La deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french.  its a canadian thing.  please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2.  BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S.  Uh what?  3 me's?  That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit.  News flash, there are three you's homeslice.  There's the past you, the present you, and the future you.  If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you's are the key.  Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you've done.  And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro.  Feeling like shit today?  Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday.  Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac?  THANK YOU YOUNGER ME.  Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that's all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME.  Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me's is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend?  you do now.  You got 2.  It's future and past you).  Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes.  I'm doing this one for future me.  Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy?  fuck you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me.  I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero).  MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better.  The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity.  Do not doubt me.  Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.

Rule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down.  seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF.  I mean it.  Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do.  But lets say you still didn't do it.  Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to.  Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive.  Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed?  so what.  I forgive you previous self.  I forgive you.  But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self.  This one's for you future homes.  Forgiveness man, use it.  I forgive you.  Say it out loud.

Last rule.  Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words.  exercise and books.  that's it.  Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter.  when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body).  when you exercise you clear your mind.  when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour.  Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool.  Feel me?  As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else.  Get some books max.  Post to reddit about not caring about yourself?  Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do?  Read 7 habits of highly successful people.  Read ""emotional intelligence"".  Read ""From good to great"".  Read “thinking fast and slow”.  Read books that will help you understand.  Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3.  It gets you to the next level that much faster.

That’s about it man.  There’s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that’s not your mission right now.  Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours.  You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off?  Your past self let you down big time, but hey…  I forgive you.  Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.

I hope I helped a little bit max.  I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3.  Gotta jet.  One last piece of advice though.  Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can’t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please.  Read this again.

Have an awesome fucking day ☺

tldr; 1.  Nonzero days as much as you can. 2.  The three you’s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional and mental)

Edit: Wow reddit gold? Thanks!  No idea what to do with it or whats the deal but many thanks!

Edit2:  Someone asked what I meant by ""much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days"".  The long and short of it is a simple truth, but it's tough to TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE.  It's this: you become what you think.  This doesnt mean if I think of a tree, I'll be oakin' it by august.  It means that the WAY you think, the THINGS you think of, and the IDEAS YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND defines the sum total that is you.  You procrastinate all the time and got fear and worry goin on for something?  You are becoming a procrastinator.  You keep thinking about how much you want to run that 5 k race in the spring and finish a champion?  Are ya keeping it in mind all the time?  Is it something that is defining your ACTIONS and influencing you DECISIONS?  If it is, then you're becoming the champion you're dreaming about.  Dreaming about it makes it.  Think and it shall be.  But do not forget that action is thought's son.  Thoughts without actions are nothing. Have faith in whatever it is you've steeled your mind to.  Have faith and follow through with action.

Ok, Ryan that's a bunch of nice words n shit, but how does that help me turn slightly nonzero days into hugely nonzero days.  Do you believe all these words you just read?  Does it makes sense to you that you BECOME WHAT YOU THINK OF?  Ask yourself: What do I think of?  When you get home and walk in the door. (how quickly did you turn that laptop on? Did turning it on make you closer to your dreams? What would?)   At the bus stop.  Lunch break.  What direction are you focusing your intentions on?  If you're like I was a few years ago, the answer was either No direction, or whatever caught my eye at the moment.  But no stress, forgive yourself.  You know the truth now.  And knowing the truth means you can watch your habits, read books on how you think and act, and finally start changing your behaviour.  Heres an example:  Feeling like bunk cause you had zero days or barely nonzero days?  THINK ABOUT WHAT YOURE DOING.  and change just a little bit more. in whatever positive direction you are choosing to go.""-ryan

[NeedAdvice] How do I start loving myself?;t3_84tdkx;3;"Over the years I started to hate myself more and more. This leads to me being angry quite often. I don't express my anger except to my mother which often leads to a lot of arguments. Outside of that I'm not seen as an angry person.

Which makes it even trigger-y.

This, of course, automatically makes you very poor company.  Because other people's flight-fight mode is going to be automatically triggered.  Which means that they will be on guard / wary / just avoid you.

Anger has a **smell**, and contrary to popular belief - anger is not bravery nor courage, because fear-anger flight-fight is for when we feel **threatened**.

Now, if reading this made you feel angry, I cannot help you.  Because you will treat me like an enemy.  That's the main problem with angry people - they automatically see everything as enemies.  And they wonder why life is so fucking hard for them.

My current policy for angry people is let them stew in their anger juices until anger finally boils over to fear.";3;0.15789473684210525;[[0.96859361]];[[0.61405836]];-0.9647;0.081;0.6829999999999999;0.23600000000000002;-0.9917;0.054000000000000006;0.664;0.282;0.07300000000000001;-0.2773109243697479;-0.2483333333333333;-0.028977591036414587

FYI, answering ""hard to answer"" threads are a f.i.n.e. way to keep writer's block at bay.  (Yet another reason why I keep pushing out walls of text.)

But for you OP - no wall of text from me, because I gotta skill up KISS for you folks stuck in ""anxiety-depression brought about by procrastination-stress"" pits.

First, you've got ""too full brain"" syndrome, which the far majority don't even know about or don't want to acknowledge (because they can't sell books to deal with it).

Our brains - our marvelous wonderful brains - have limited space, and because of too much procrastination-stress you kept filling up limited brain attic with super-sticky bad memories.

Shhh... calm down.  We gotta stop the flow of super-sticky bad memories first, then we can start digging them out, so your brain feels light so you can actually see more options.

Do you exercise? Sign up with a personal trainer if you don’t, make them push you to create a rhythm if it’s not part of your lifestyle. 

Look at the basics of your routine, perhaps this is a habit you have that has a snowball effect on the rest of your day that you aren’t aware of. It doesn’t take much to tip off balance.

Emotions are responses to your situation, try to take them as a sign or call to action rather than an affliction (there’s lots of reading and ideas around this available for free with a quick google). With this in mind try understand what your being alerted to and change it in a way that suits you. A big change or bit by bit.

Remember at all times you are enough, be true to yourself and stop accepting external pressures. It’s hard, but step by step freeing!

Well done for talking, keep it up, keep trying!!

I've changed course once and been here for three years, I don't want these 3 years to be a waste. I'm currently on Easter break and have 9,000 words to write but I've done 200 in a week.

The problem is, even though this is the biggest academic step of my life. I am NOT motivated, a lot of my friends are naturally smart and don't have to try as hard but I'm struggling. I'm averaging 57% and need to get 64% in the rest of my exams/coursework to bring my grade up to 60%. I'm currently doing coursework but I don't know what my problem is, I don't know if it's because this year is worth 30% of my degree or that I'm lazy. 

I think I'm kind of scared because it's so hard to predict grades, I'm scared to really go in like I did with previous exams only to do bad and be disappointed. Because it's left down to me, I don't know if what I'm doing is 100% right or how much time I should be spending on it. 

I really want to be as dedicated and motivated as I used to be as I really want to do well but I'm doing nothing about it. 

Any tips to get down to work? ";2;"**Small goals** - Big goals can be another form of procrastination

When you think about writing do you think this?
&gt; Ugh I have to write 9000 words

Or do you think this?
&gt; I am going to write 250 words in 15 minutes

If your goal is 9000 words and you don't write 9000 words when you sit down you have failed and that just feels shitty. Change your goal so you get a win every time you sit down and I promise you will make change happen over time. 

Setting goals this way isn't the natural way our brains work, but working on this skill will pay dividends and you will feel much better. Writing 50 words every day, **consistently**, will take you much farther than just hoping one day you will feel like it and crank out an entire project.


&amp;nbsp;

**Track your time**

Use the pomodoro technique and just try to spend 25 minutes being productive (this is a nice small goal!). If that doesn't work shrink the time until you don't feel resistance to action.

Tracking your successful time will help you develop momentum. Try to do it every day and mark of your success on a calendar. If you miss try not to miss twice.

&amp;nbsp;

**Set some accountability**

If you have someone you can work with, plan times to meet up and work together. If you don't then there are tools for that too. Check out focusmate.com and book a time to get down to business. 

This is my preferred method of late since I don't really need to plan a time out with someone else. I just choose when to work and go.

&amp;nbsp;

**Don't Wait On Motivation**

Motivation is fleeting and unreliable. You need to set up small routines and set goals that allow for easy wins every single day in order to make change happen. You can rely on willpower to get yourself over the hump of procrastination, but remember that willpower is finite (again this is where those lovely small goals come in).

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**

Setting small goals allows you to flex your willpower muscle to get started. Winning those small goals makes you feel good. And tracking those wins helps you develop momentum.

If you can find a way to make yourself accountable to someone then do that too.";2;1.0;[[0.97655791]];[[0.42470774]];-0.9776;0.091;0.711;0.198;0.9964;0.159;0.81;0.03;-0.236;-0.030111111111111127;0.12109126984126982;-0.15120238095238095

";8;"Start with one habit and gradually incorporate other habits. 

Start with study time of 5 minutes and gradually increase 2 minutes each successive week i.e. every 7 days. 

Week 1 - 5 minutes each x 7 days = 35 minutes/week


Week 2 - 7 minutes each x 7 days = 49 minutes/week


and so on........


Week 12 - 27 minutes x 7 days = 189 minutes/week 


In 12 weeks, you accomplish a study time of ~1345 minutes or ~22.5 hours


Once you complete 12 weeks, add another habit and repeat the cycle. 


In 24 (12+12) weeks, you accomplish a study time of 4,700 minutes or ~78 hours and later cap the study time at 60 minutes/day.


Don't focus on more than 3-4 habits. 


1) Study


2) Journaling


3) Exercise


4) Socialize


You can take spanish classes on weekends and review them on week days time to time. You can also travel during weekends.

[NeedAdvice] I have a gap year and I'd like to spend it productively;t3_89j9it;5;"Hello! So, some background: I'm a high school junior who was able to finish school a year early due to some cool opportunities. I applied to a tech school, and was put on conditional transfer admission, which doesn't interest me based on other school choices.

I've decided to try to use this year to really hone in on my interests and work on myself and my discipline, and try to get some sort of project off the ground or. I greatly enjoy physics, and I've got some experience with robotics, but I would absolutely love some guidance from people who've worked for themselves or pursued personal projects before.

I will also have to apply to University again, and I am worried about looking back on the year ahead and not being able to justify it. How does one tread this line of 'self work' correctly?

 Thank you!";13;I’d say use that time on forming habits that will improve your mental and physical health. Working out, meditation, journaling, etc. That way you’re setting yourself up for success and ready for whatever life throws in your face. University will bring lots of stress, learning how to manage and relieve that will serve you well. Then of course, work on your hobbies and create cool stuff, the world of electronics is endless!

 Thank you!";13;"Maybe this is weird advice, but I'm going to suggest you start by getting a job. I had a lot of free time for about a year and then suddenly had almost none. Guess when I got more done? Yeah, when I didn't have all the time in the world to do all the things I wanted to. 

Just make sure it's a job that 1) you can leave at work and 2) won't leave you *totally* exhausted at the end of the day. 

Bonus: If you're living at home, you can put a ton of that money in a 401k and because it will be in there so long you'll have a *lot* more than you otherwise would when you retire. Specifically, if you put in $15,000, got 11% return on your investment (average for the S&amp;P 500) and never invested again, when you hit retirement age you'd have $ 2,479,118.

 Thank you!";13;"Dude Im in the exact same position in the sense that Im taking a year off school too. What Im gonna focus on is getting in better shape, and making cool robotics stuff. I personally got a 3d printer and a TON of electronic components including an arduino. My first project is to custom make a functional spiderman webshooter (dont laugh lol) that i can use to attach and repell small items back to me. I also plan on making a robotic arm but thats gonna take alot of time.

 Thank you!";13;"Wow this is really exciting! I don't know anything about robotics but definitely take this time to pursue what you love. When you're in University you'll probably have less time to pursue side projects (at least that's what happened to me). The best advice I have is to try new things because you're at this cool stage in your life where you're still figuring out who you are and what you wanna do. I never thought I'd be interested in marketing until one day I kinda fell into it and now I can't get enough of it! So even if you ""think"" you'd hate something, make sure you give it a try. Take this time to read up on physics and tackle some robotics projects.

Another thing you could do is take this time to face some of your fears. That'll really help you grow. If I didn't push myself out of my comfort zone, I wouldn't have great friends or be doing work that I love. I'm a big believer in getting comfortable with what makes you uncomfortable. 

Hope you have a great year :)";2;0.15384615384615385;[[0.95788886]];[[0.6081025]];0.9141;0.113;0.857;0.03;0.9865;0.237;0.66;0.10400000000000001;-0.05;0.21541666666666667;0.22117604617604614;-0.005759379509379492

 Thank you!";13;"It all comes down to your habits.

There's a fine line when one gets too much time, especially coming out of high school where a lot of your time (at least half or more) is regimented and scheduled for you.

With abundance, people can VERY easily fall into the trap of NOT valuing their time and just squandering and wasting it. Just look around you in your life or even just on reddit, many people just waste tremendous amounts of time on useless and pointless things that in the end don't provide much, if any satisfaction. 

Especially not long-term satisfaction.

So as one user said, focus on forming useful habits because they will set you up FOR LIFE and will reap you massive benefits and rewards.

Instead of having bad habits that pull you in the deepest darkest depths and despair of life, winning habits works like compound interest to fast track you toward where you want to go in life. 

The fundamental habits to hone down on are...

1. Diet (shopping, cooking, and having easy, tasty, healthy meals/recipes to make)
2. Sleep (figure out best sleeping patterns for you and what you can and can't get away with)
3. Exercise (break a little sweat each day)
4. Meditation (anything that helps to strengthen your mindfulness and awareness works, doesn't have to be meditation but imo meditation is the best form)
5. Time management
6. Goal setting/planning
7. Resting and relaxing - funnily enough the majority of people are really poor at this skill and it is important

Take a broad overview of the area of robotics/physics, then narrow down and hone in on say three select areas that particularly take your interest.

Then choose one to pursue and do a project around. It doesn't have to be one but I recommend one because this allows you to niche down and really get to the nitty gritty of things.

Best indicator for it is to pick the one that really pulls you to it and makes you obsess over it. Something you'd do regardless of if you'd ever get paid for it in your life.

Then just use the internet and google and learn as much as you can about it, reach out to people who know about it too, learn how to cold call/email/connect and build a network and connection.

You never know where this may lead you to but I'm sure if you follow this advice and go after it whole-heartedly for the year, you won't regret it and likely find a potential career path for yourself or at the least, you will learn a lot about yourself and whatever project you decided to go with";2;0.15384615384615385;[[0.93128564]];[[0.54050725]];0.9141;0.113;0.857;0.03;0.9905;0.134;0.821;0.045;-0.0060000000000000045;0.21541666666666667;0.11354320987654322;0.10187345679012344
