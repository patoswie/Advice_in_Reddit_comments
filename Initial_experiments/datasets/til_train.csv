0;If people from Denver are called Denverites, what are people from Paris called?
1;"For the full etymology:

&gt;The word gentilic comes from the Latin gentilis (""of a clan, or gens"") and the English suffix -ic.[9] The word demonym was derived from the Greek word meaning ""populace"" (δῆμος demos) with the suffix for ""name"" (-onym).

&gt;*National Geographic* attributes the term ""demonym"" to Merriam-Webster editor Paul Dickson in a recent work from 1990. The word did not appear for nouns, adjectives, and verbs derived from geographical names in the *Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary* nor in prominent style manuals such as the *Chicago Manual of Style.* It was subsequently popularized in this sense in 1997 by Dickson in his book *Labels for Locals. However, in What Do You Call a Person From...? A Dictionary of Resident Names* (the first edition of *Labels for Locals*), Dickson attributed the term to George H. Scheetz, in his *Names' Names: A Descriptive and Prescriptive Onymicon* (1988), which is apparently where the term first appears. The term may have been fashioned after demonymic, which the *Oxford English Dictionary* defines as the name of an Athenian citizen according to the deme to which the citizen belongs, with its first use traced to 1893.

**Note:** There are a very, very small handful of words that use a *prefix* but they are such a rare exception to suffixes that  it wasn't worth noting in the headline. "

So, when I had a 7 ton wheel loader, I could, completely legally, put a five year old in it and tell him ""Go to the petrol station and fill ut up, here's some money."" (which I, of course, didn't do). Insane."

12;"&gt; Current medical literature does not describe precisely the activation and mechanisms of prostate orgasms. 

Dammit"
13;"Also, TIL I need to find out how to have butt-free super orgasms.

&gt;THE RELEVANT CASE STUDY
The subject was a 63‐year‐old, medically qualified male in good physical health with a good libido and a normal prostate on digital examination. He experimented initially with an Aneros helix prostate stimulator for prostatic massage to relieve symptoms from an episode of prostatitis. He rapidly became highly orgasmic with the device (without the use of sexual fantasy) after only a few hours of use, spread over several occasions. He also had a course of the PDE‐5 inhibitor tadalafil 2.5 mg daily which is now licensed for lower urinary tract symptoms in men. His prostatitis symptoms resolved within 2 months of regular Aneros use several times weekly combined with tadalafil. However, he found that the intense orgasms produced by the device were highly addictive and many were subjectively in the ‘Super‐O’ category described above. Despite the device being inserted in the anus and lower rectum, he described the orgasms as being felt in the penis, perineum, and pelvis, similar to a normal male orgasm. When becoming really intense in the Super‐O category, he experienced some whole body sensation with some involuntary muscular contracting and shaking. He stopped using the Aneros after about 2 months and attempted to overcome the addiction to the device.

&gt;Whilst using the Aneros, he had produced some secretions from the urethra, but he did not normally ejaculate. He had been in the habit of wearing a condom to catch these secretions and any possible ejaculate. He had mainly used the device lying prone with a couple of pillows to support his pelvis with the penis hanging comfortably in between, as he would some of the time become erect or partially erect whilst using the device. The Aneros forum describes a process of rewiring when learning to orgasm with the device and it then becomes possible to experience Aneros‐free orgasms. Our subject found that he could achieve intense orgasms by lying prone wearing a condom without the Aneros present, the condom and the pillows being sufficient stimuli to trigger a reflex orgasm without any direct mechanical stimulation to the penis. The ability to orgasm without the device has persisted for at least 12 months since the last insertion of the Aneros.

&gt;This subject found that whilst the orgasms were extremely enjoyable at the time, he could easily spend too much time experiencing them. Further, he had an old neck injury which flared up in association with some neck spasm at orgasm whilst lying prone. It has proved difficult to stop experiencing these orgasms and ‘unwire’ himself back to normal. He attempted this by replacing the passive stimulus with stimulatory masturbation or sexual intercourse, and in the process became multiorgasmic with both sexual scenarios up to 10 orgasms before the final ejaculation). He has managed to stay off non‐stimulatory orgasms for several months at a time, but has had a tendency to relapse."

16;Today I wish I didn't learn about him.
17;"Who wouldn't be addicted to super orgasms, lol. Most men would be if they weren't so stuck on their homophobic egos and sexual stigmas.

Edit: self-prostate stimulation is merely another form of male masturbation, not homosexuality, for those who are to convoluted to understand the difference."

35;"I always thought ""Little Britain"" is Brittany (today part of France).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Britain_(disambiguation)

&gt;    a translation of the Medieval Latin toponym Britannia Minor (""Lesser Britain""), referring to Brittany

&gt;    a translation of the Irish toponym An Bhreatain Bheag, meaning Wales

&gt;    a translation of the Classical Greek toponym Μικρὰ Βρεττανία, a name used by the geographer Ptolemy to refer to Ireland

So the conclusion is that there are multiple meaning, but OP is probably right in that the Ireland one is the *earliest*."
36;r/absolutelynotmeira
37;"No sure about the source behind that one, you should double check it rather than blindly trusting it. On the [Talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Britain_(place_name\)#Ireland)  they discuss how the original text may have been misinterpreted by a wiki editor (apparently little Britain referred to Scotland which was misconstrued as a separate island?):

&gt; ""In his Almagest, Ptolemy used the term Μικρὰ Βρεττανία (Mikra Brettania) for Ireland""

&gt; This has to be a mistake (albeit a sourced one). The reference is to Almagest 2.6.25-27 [Heiberg 1898] translated as:

&gt; The twenty-fifth parallel has a longest day of 18 equatorial hours. This is 58 degrees from the equator and passes through the southern part of 'Mikra Brettania'. The twenty-sixth parallel has a longest day of 18.5 equatorial hours. This is 59.5 degrees from the equator and passes through the middle part of 'Mikra Brettania'. The parallel where the longest day is 19 equatorial hours is 61 degrees from the equator and passes through the northern parts of 'Mikra Brettania'.

&gt; Ireland stretches from Clear Island at 51°26'N, 09°30'W to Malin Head at 55°23'N, 07°23'W. Even allowing for errors in latitude, the day lengths at longest day make the identification with Ireland impossible."

62;The beer is unfortunately not that good.  My town is over 1200 years old but the local brewery is only 274 years old.

75;"&gt;T. gondii may also influence the behaviour of infected people, possibly when it is carried in the bloodstream to the brain where it can form cysts in the amygdala



&gt;Behavioural modifications in humans could thus be an ancestral legacy of our evolutionary past

From the comments on the article by [NatureAdvocate](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/07/chanel_no_5_a_brain_parasite_may_be_the_secret_to_the_famous_perfume_.html):

&gt;""The Crazy Cat Lady"" is not just an urban legend and humorous stereotype. There's biomedical evidence to prove why women get like they do. Their minds have been hijacked by their cats' parasites -- Toxoplasma gondii. No different than a rodent's brain that gets hijacked by this parasite too.

&gt;People whose brains have been hijacked by this parasite explains why cat-hoarders can't smell the overwhelming stench of cat-urine in their own homes that now permeates the whole neighborhood (and the home must be demolished later), and rescuers must wear gas-masks just to enter their premises. This goes FAR beyond someone just getting used to the smells in their own home. The same way that it hijacks rodents' minds to make them attracted to cat-urine it does the same to humans. You know there's something terribly wrong with a brain so damaged that they can't even smell it, so bad that the cat-hoarders' homes have to be demolished as a public-health-hazard so the neighborhood won't suffer from it any longer. Some infected humans even find the smell of cat-urine to be attractive. One of the sometimes suggested easier ways to tell if you've had your brain-hijacked by this parasite is you don't find the scent of cat-urine offensive or fail to notice that scent in the homes of cat-owners.

&gt;This too has caused an interesting study of why ""Chanel #5"" perfume was such an historical success. Cat pheromones are used in ""Chanel #5"". With the high prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in the male population in France (due to their cultural practice of eating raw and undercooked meats infected with this cats' parasite, meats infected from cats roaming around stockyards and farms), men who have had their brains hijacked by this parasite are attracted to these cat-scents in the perfume.

&gt;Another interesting study: They found that women infected with this cats' brain-hijacking parasite are nearly 2X's more likely to commit suicide even though they've never had any mental or emotional health issues before. And an interesting note to this is that T. gondii infected women were far more likely to commit more sudden, gruesome, and painful acts of suicide -- like leaping to their deaths or severing arteries or purposely running into high-speed traffic. None of that peaceful failing to wake-up from a drug overdose for Toxoplasma gondii infected women! No-sirree! It's gotta be bold and gruesome!

&gt;This is why I and many others are almost certain, that just like T. gondii hijacks the brains of rodents, it does the same to humans. They are now, for lack of a more descriptive euphemism, like pod-people that have been taken-over by an alien life-form. Doing the bidding of the parasite in their minds that is controlling them to ensure the perpetuation of the parasite (as-is the same function when it hijacks rodents' brains). Their human thoughts demoted to that of parasitic protozoan awareness, where only its base biochemical survival matters, without concern nor regard for anything else in its environment. (Sounds just like most cat-people, doesn't it.) I suppose a few subconsciously sense this eventually, and that is why they suddenly and inexplicably leap to their deaths or run out into traffic for no apparent reason.

&gt;Though the majority of these T. gondii controlled ""cat ladies"" can't see anything beyond their need to spread more of T. gondii's required reproductive hosts (cats) on the planet. They can't be reasoned with. They no longer think like humans anymore, they're thinking how the parasites in their minds want them to reason and think. As for the rest of you who haven't been taken-over by this brain-controlling parasite -- you can argue with a protozoan parasite in a cat-hoarder's brain if you want, but I'll tell you right now you're only wasting your time. Parasitic protozoans in a human's mind refuse to listen to reason -- it's not that they won't, they just can't. To think and reason goes far beyond a single-celled parasite's functions in someone's mind.

78;"There are a few parasites that change behavior in animals, most are highly specialized for its prey.

This is one of the few that seems to affect a wider range of animals, from rats to chimps to people.

I'm not a scientist and I don't have hard documentation to back it up, but I really honestly think Toxoplasmosis is the cause of ""crazy cat lady"".  The fact people can sit in the filth and urine of so many cats and not only not be phased by it, but be violently defensively in love with the cats at the same time... its a mental disorder most likely caused by the infection.  I mean the symptoms match up with what all the other animals do when they are infected."

85;"&gt; This beer takes seven months to make and we use a technique known as ice distillation where we freeze the beer down to -40 degrees Celsius for a period of months. Then we can take away the ice and we concentrate the liquid, we concentrate the alcohol, but most importantly, we're concentrating the flavors and the aromas.

Ah, I was gonna say, you can't make a 55% alcohol beer.  That level requires distillation.  So, it's not really a beer, it's a distilled spirit."

Elves don't go to a higher plane. They go to the Halls of Mandos (located in The Undying Lands), and after time are usually given the decision whether to leave or stay. Following this they can indeed go to Middle Earth again, or wherever else might please them. To say they go to a 'higher plane' is absolutely and fundamentally against the spirit of Tolkien's elves - they are explicitly tied to Arda (the world) and will be with it until the world's end. Men go outside of the bounds of Arda when they die, to places known only to Ilúvatar (God, the creator). This is a source of anxiety for men (fear of the unknown), but is also considered a gift. The elves being tied to Arda, and men being destined to go beyond its bounds, is at the core of Tolkien's mythos. This is part of why elves have a greater relationship with the Earth - they are with it until it ends."
203;Technically, by the definitions laid out in the Silmarillion, all of the races in Middle-Earth, with the exception of the races created in perversion of the good ones by Morgoth and Sauron, are immortal. The difference between Elves and Men lies in the fact that where Elves are given choice to be reincarnated in a new body and return or stay in the Halls of Mandos, the souls of Men return directly to Iluvatar to join in his eternal song. Dwarves are created by Aule and they return to the earth they were created from. Hobbits are the only unknown case since they had no place in Iluvatar's song and arose through unknown means.

Cancer risk associated with simian virus 40 contaminated polio vaccine.
Fisher SG1, Weber L, Carbone M.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The presence of SV40 in monkey cell cultures used in the preparation of the polio vaccine from 1955 through 1961 is well documented. Investigations have consistently demonstrated the oncogenic behavior of SV40 in animal models. Early epidemiologic studies were inadequate in demonstrating an increase in cancer incidence associated with contaminated vaccine. Recently, investigators have provided persuasive evidence that SV40 is present in human ependymomas, choroid plexus tumors, bone tumors, and mesotheliomas, however, the etiologic role of the virus in tumorigenesis has not been established.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Using data from SEER, we analyzed the incidence of brain tumors, bone tumors, and mesotheliomas from 1973-1993 and the possible relationship of these tumors with the administration of the SV40 contaminated vaccine.

RESULTS:
Our analysis indicates increased rates of ependymomas (37%), osteogenic sarcomas (26%), other bone tumors (34%) and mesothelioma (90%) among those in the exposed as compared to the unexposed birth cohort.

CONCLUSIONS:
These data suggest that there may be an increased incidence of certain cancers among the 98 million persons exposed to contaminated polio vaccine in the U.S.; further investigations are clearly justified.

Rant:

Living in southern Ontario, where the housing market is crazy and subdivisions are spreading like crazy I am always surprised at the amount of new homeowners that have no idea about anything. Yes. Most of a fire hydrant is underground. Where did you think the watermain was? Just below your feet?

Honestly, home services or how communities work on a multilevel scale should be taught in school. You have the option to take ridiculious university level classes that take you no where in life. Where are the basic engineering courses so you know how your damn house works? You shit in your toilet everyday, all you know is that it ends up at the wastewater plant. How does it get there? How far below your feet is it? 

My water comes out the tap, how does it get to my house? You all know nothing and it makes me so mad because I already feel as if I dont know enough about gas lines, sewer lines, water distribution, rain fall collection, etc. 
Rant over

Yes, most of a hydrant is underground because thats where the watermain is. 

Fun Fact: At the part of the hydrant where it is level with the ground is a break off point, so the top of the hydrant (the actual hydrant you see) breaks off wile the rest stays in the ground as not to cause water to blow up into the air. 
This is espescially important in places with colder winters if the hydrant isnt shut off all the way. It can leak and freeze. 

Fun fact 2: The top nut of the hydrant is the operating nut. Turnig it will rotate the stem snd unscrew the plungershaped valve at the bottom allow water to push itself up into the barrel. 

Fun fact 3: if the threads on the plunger shaped valve wear out over time there is always a watermain valve in front of the fire hydrant “secondary valve” to shut the watermain off and block water from going to the hydrant. The same way houses have “curb stop” or “property line” little ball valves to shut the water off at your property line or incase the valve in your house breaks.

According to the eugenic and scientific racist theories of the early 20th century, people with Down syndrome were atavistic throwbacks to an earlier stage of human development, and by extension, all Asians (who they referred to as ""Mongoloids"") were also part of the that earlier stage of human development.  ""Caucasians"" were the pinnacle of human development so those with Down syndrome were people of a different race who were were born to a more developed race."

401;"*The engine stopped, and a fire warning light flashed. He pulled the lever to deploy auxiliary power, and it broke off in his hand. Though not wearing a pressure suit, he ejected into the −50 °C (−58 °F) air. He suffered immediate frostbite, and decompression caused his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth to bleed. His abdomen swelled severely. He did, however, manage to make use of his emergency oxygen supply. Five minutes after he abandoned the plane, his parachute hadn't opened. While in the upper regions of the thunderstorm, with near-zero visibility, the parachute opened prematurely instead of at 10,000 feet due to the storm affecting the barometric parachute switch to open. After ten minutes, Rankin was still aloft, carried by updrafts and getting hit by hailstones. Violent spinning and pounding caused him to vomit. Lightning appeared, which he described as blue blades several feet thick, and thunder that he could feel. The rain forced him to hold his breath to keep from drowning. One lightning bolt lit up the parachute, making Rankin believe he had died.*

For 30 seconds I thought the decompression had me,” ...“It was a shocking cold all over (-65F). My ankles and wrists began to burn as though somebody had put dry ice on my skin. My left hand went numb. I had lost that glove when I went out.”

&gt;“I’d see lightning. Boy, do I remember that lightning,” Rankin told Time Magazine. “I never exactly heard the thunder; I felt it. I remember falling through hail, and that worried me; I was afraid the hail would tear the chute. Sometimes I was falling through heavy water — I’d take a breath and breathe in a mouthful of water. Sometimes I had the sensation I was looping the chute. I was blown up and down as much as 6,000 feet at a time. It went on for a long time, like being on a very fast elevator, with strong blasts of compressed air hitting you.”"

460;"Thought it was interesting that for a long time rogue waves were probably so rarely observed because they tended to destroy the ships that encountered them:
&gt;Author Susan Casey wrote that much of that disbelief came because there were very few people who had seen a rogue wave, and until the advent of steel double-hulled ships of the 20th century ""people who encountered 100-foot rogue waves generally weren't coming back to tell people about it.""

Details of the Draupner Wave:
&gt;The rig was built to withstand a calculated 1 in 10,000 years wave with a predicted height of 64 feet (19.5 m) and was also fitted with state-of-the-art laser wave recorder on the platform’s underside. At 3 p.m. on 1 January 1995 it recorded an 85 feet (25.9 m) rogue wave (i.e. 21 feet [6.4 m] taller than the predicted 10,000 year wave) that hit the rig at 45 miles per hour (72.4 km/h). This was the first confirmed measurement of a freak wave, more than twice as tall and steep as its neighbors with characteristics that fell outside any known wave model."
461;[One hit one of the Crab fishing boats on an early season Deadliest Catch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_8hOai9hGQ).  It's still one of the few confirmed rogue waves ever caught on video.

That used to be steel at least about 30mm thick, more in case of the tanker. And a single wave of water just punched a hole into it like paper. "
463;On a much smaller scale you can find these on the great lakes and small inland lakes. During choppy weather you will be looking at maybe 24 inch waves, then once a day you get hit with something 48 inches and sit there wondering WTF. 
464;It’s believed it was a rogue wave which sunk the Andrea Gail (made famous in the book and film “The Perfect Storm”). They have no way of knowing as the boat sunk without any communication. The evidence they have of this was a wave measurement device a hundred or so Km away which read a wave of 100 feet before it was utterly destroyed. That reading came on the same day they lost contact. They also found the boat’s emergency beacon washed up on a beach a while later. It hadn’t been activated, which lends to the idea that something came out of nowhere and took the boat straight down.

502;You would think after bribing 70 guards + the warden, one could just simply walk out.
503;Seems like it would have made more sense to just buy the prison and turn it into his house.
504;2.5 mill!? That it, that's pocket change for him 
505;About $35k per guard which is 630k in pesos. A HUGE sum in Mexico, you’re set for a while! 
506;"He did not escape in the laundry cart. That is the “official” story. The real one makes more sense actually. 

I know I’m coming off as some conspiracy theorist, but read me out. 

Prior to escaping, Chapo pretty much had every guard and the warden on his payroll. He would hold parties with alcohol and prostitutes with everybody’s knowledge. Not only would he bribe the guards but the Federal Police as well. 

The guy that helped him “escape” in the cart was the fall guy. The guards noticed that he was missing from his cell. They raise the alarm. Federal Police comes to “lockdown” the prison. Meanwhile Chapo is waiting for them in a closed room (if I remember correctly the kitchen). They came in with an extra uniform, Chapo gets into official Federal Police uniform. NOW he can really escape the prison. He then gets into a police truck with his accomplices (all real policemen) and leaves the jail. Please keep in mind that it’s standard for cops and soldiers to wear face masks during this kind of operations. So he definitely could not be identified.

This is shown on Netflix series El Chapo and some books as well such as “Los señores del narco” by Anabel Hernández. She’s a well respected journalist which is known amongst other things for exposing a pedophile businessman known as “the king of denim” (as in he owns a big share of the denim manufacturing in Mexico) that happened to be protected by a Mexican governor at the time.

519;I heard there was a tunnel with a motorbike type thing on a rail for travel
520;Like someone wouldn’t ask “hey? Where the fuck is El Chapo?” 
521;So why the need to be sneaked out in a laundry cart if he bought off all the prison guards plus the warden? Did he want it to feel like he was in some type of mission impossible movie?

527;With 70 guards and the Warden playing a part in his escape, what's the whole point of laundry basket ruse?! With that much support, the guy could have just literally walked out the door without any complications.

561;"&gt;But here's the truth: spinach doesn't have much more iron than other leafy greens like broccoli and Brussels sprouts.

Yes it does...It has more than double the amount.

Cooked spinach, 1 cup, 6.4mg  
Cooked broccoli, 1 cup, 1.0mg  
Cooked Kale, 1 cup, 1.2mg  
Cooked brussel sprouts, 1 cup, 2.7mg  

"
562;It was a misplaced decimal point, making people think it had ten times the iron it actually did.
563;It doesn't just have less iron than advertised, it's actually an inhibitor for iron absorption. [Oxalate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalate) Is highly prevalent in Spinach and binds to iron, preventing absorption.
564;Also it's non-heme iron, which is absorbed a lot less readily than heme iron (found in meat).

*As a fun fact, the report that Titanic was being towed to Halifax was a result of two messages getting crossed in translation because everyone was talking over each other on the same channel. The part about Titanic was Olympic asking if Titanic was safe. The second part comes from a report about the SS Asian towing the Deutschland to Halifax because it ran out of coal in the mid-Atlantic.*

The battle was intended to resolve a dispute over which clan was to hold the right flank in an upcoming battle of both clans (and several others) against Clan Cameron. The Clan Macpherson is thought to have won, but only twelve men survived from the original sixty.[13]"

797;"Not exactly. 30,000 years ago there were 3 species/subspecies of humans alive: *Homo sapiens, Homo neanderthalensis*, and *Homo sapiens Denisova* (though there's debate about exactly what to call Neanderthals and Denisovans, subspecies or separate species).   

They say something different about *Homo floresiensis*. Later examination of the age of the bones on Flores indicate an age of closer to 60,000 years ago, even though they initially thought the ""Hobbits"" were around until more recently. Knowing what we know now about *Homo floresiensis*, they wouldn't be called human. They aren't sure of their origin, but they may be descendants of *Homo habilis* or *Home erectus*. "
798;Oh, and Spaiens and Neantherdal boned a lot. Inter-species Tinder was all the rage back then!
799;I know a few Neanderthals. :)
800;You just learned about this today?
801;Neanderthals invented heavy metal, floresiencis had the first Romance language that eventually lead to modern Italians and Sapiens were the intellectuals 
802;"The way they define words like ""extreme"" is important here.

They define it as making less than $1.90 per day (US).  I don't know about you, but someone making $2 per day is still extremely poor.  So is someone making $3 a day, or $4 a day, or...

This statistic is a matter of definition.

Half the people on this planet make less than $2.50 a day (US).

"
803;"Much of that is because of China, which has lifted more people out of poverty in a shorter time than any other human society in history.

"
804;Millions saved from extreme poverty by redefinition of term!
805;I find this figure more than a little suspect. 
806;In other news, the definition of extreme poverty was altered to exclude the malnourished.
807;"I wonder how much of that change comes from lowering the upper limit of what is considered ""Extreme Poverty""."
808;Could this also be because of the huge population increase? 
809;How do we judge extreme poverty? Cause if we judge it at 1990 standards, it may be different then today’s standards. People in extreme poverty are living like kings compared to the humans of 40,000 years ago. It’s all about perspective.
810;Hear any liberals or progressives mention this?   Uh, no.
811;I was at the Royal Tyrell Museum a couple of weeks ago. This dinosaur looks absolutely amazing close up. The museum has done an awesome job with everything, it's well worth a visit!
812;"&gt;The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes. Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal’s skull. Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward. I can count the scales on its sole. Caleb Brown, a postdoctoral researcher at the museum, grins at my astonishment. “We don’t just have a skeleton,” he tells me later. “We have a dinosaur as it would have been.”

This is extremely impressive, and quite amazing that it was accidentally stumbled upon and not damaged/destroyed by the miners before they realized what it was.  Thanks for posting, I hadn't read about this when it was found."
813;Conspiracy: it WAS walking around a couple of weeks ago 
814;"I've been able to spend time in the exhibit by myself and the specimen is haunting. When you take the time to look into its eyes you could swear there was still life in them.

815;All I wanted was a panned out picture of the entire thing and instead I only got close ups and an animation :/
816;"This blows my mind.

So can we conclude they were or were not covered in feathers?"
817;All those close up shots and not one picture of the whole fucking thing? wtf?
818;I always wondered if all the artist renditions of what they might have looked like might have been way off, but this is pretty damn close
819;I always love seeing this get shared on Reddit. I was fortunate enough to be working in the mine at the time when this fossil was discovered. A few years after, I visited the Royal Tyrell Museum and I got a chance to see them working on restoring the fossil. I cannot wait to make another trip to see the fossil now on display. 
820;It's 18 feet long, heavily armored, and a ton and a half of of teeth and bad temper.  I'm glad it wasn't walking around a couple of weeks ago, because _I_ was walking around a couple of weeks ago, and I'm not completely confident it would like me.

"
827;"That’s amazing! I always thought what dinosaur looked like was only theory, like they could have had feathers even! That’s so cool to finally know! Thank you! 
Side note. The people who have figured that out by studying fossils of their bones only are amazing!
Do you think that people believed in dragons back in the day because finds like this were more common? Were they in our early history/prehistory?"
828;"Would've been nice if they didn't break it while trying to lift it.
I can't believe they didn't slide a decent base under it to stop it from breaking.. Not sure what they were thinking trying to lift such a specimen in such a way.. you can watch it here.

829;Life uh, finds a way..
830;"Updates since that Nat Geo article was printed:

They ended up naming the species after the guy who spent 5 years carefully cleaning up the fossil. 

They were able to do pigment analysis of the preserved skin and concluded that the dino’s coloration provided a form of camouflage called countershading, where the back is darkest and the belly is the lightest. Countershading is not seen in giant animals today (e.g. elephants and rhinos) because they are so big that they don’t worry much about predation. That this giant, armored dino still needed camouflage suggests that whatever ate it was really gnarly.

Might I suggest substituting the potato-based side dish with a healthier salad?

Another case is people selling fish next to a river for you to 'release', only for them to be caught again down the stream, rinse and repeat. (this is especially prevalent in water towns).

The people doing this just argue that they need to make a living as well, and the police aren't paid enough for this anyways.

The media ran with it, as though the science was creating a direct link, to such an extent that one if the original author's actual published a rebuttal, to his own article, clarifying the point that this isn't causal relationship, and implying there is one is premature.

The phrase ""I would do anything for love, but I won't do that"" has the sense of a price you're not willing to pay or a line you're not willing to cross. None of the ""thats"" Meatloaf won't do carry that meaning. So why's he putting so much emphasis on this unwillingness? It's a love song. The lyrics are not cleverly ambiguous. They're misleading through being dumb. And there's not even always a negation to connect to the ""that"". It tracks in the first verse, but that's about it."

The findings were indeed pretty alarming. In 25% of steroid users, there were signs of arterial blockage while in non-steroid users, straight up 0% had signs of such. All the participants were young, too.

Recently I've been pretty worried about my own heart health since my uncle died when he was 30 (and I'm 27 now) to a cardiac arrest due to coronary artery blockage, but I recently learned that when mom and her siblings were cleaning their deceased brother's house, they found several empty bottles of steroids.

She was given hundreds of clothing coupons by brides-to-be from all parts of the country to help her pay for her dress. She had to return the coupon gifts as it was illegal for her to use them though.[6]


It doesn’t say that she really saved them up - the government gave her extra coupons. [A month’s supply of coupons was between 3-5.5](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/8-facts-about-clothes-rationing-in-britain-during-the-second-world-war), so 200 is pretty significant."

I spoke with a surgeon who recommended removal, said it wouldn't impact my life at all and hopefully would cure my nausea, come to find out it can actually make nausea worse because bile is just continuously draining from the liver instead of being stored and used when needed. It also makes your digestive system freak out when eating something with higher fat content because you don't have any stores to digest the food properly.

1438;"&gt; In 1964, the Army was informed that DuPont could not mass-produce the IMR 4475 stick powder to the specifications demanded by the M16. Therefore, Olin Mathieson Company provided a high-performance ball propellant. While the Olin WC 846 powder achieved the desired 3,300 ft (1,000 m) per second muzzle velocity, it produced much more fouling, that quickly jammed the M16s action (unless the rifle was cleaned well and often).
&gt; 
&gt; In March 1965, the Army began to issue the XM16E1 to infantry units. However, the rifle was initially delivered without adequate cleaning kits or instructions because Colt had claimed the M16 was self-cleaning. As a result, reports of stoppages in combat began to surface. The most severe problem, was known as ""failure to extract""—the spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after the rifle was fired. Documented accounts of dead U.S. troops found next to disassembled rifles eventually led to a Congressional investigation.

The rifle got a bad reputation because of a lot of the jams and other issues...but it seems it wasn't the rifle, it was the ammunition and lack of a proper cleaning kit."
1439;"This isn't even close to being true. The issue was a combination of factors of rushing the M16 into service due to the failures of the M14 program. The use of ball powder in military AR15s continues to this day.

The number one indicator of if units would experience issues with the M16 was if units received and trained with the M16 stateside or if the M16 was standard issue only for Vietnam.

1461;"My brother in law (75) was in the Green Beret. He used to fire 180 rounds of 45, less of 223 or 308 every afternoon. He said they routinely practiced shooting 600 yards with a 308, open sights, (Probably early 60's) The front sight was larger than the entire target at that distance, so they compensated by drifting the sight to either side of the target. There were spotters who radioed them to provide feedback to the shooters.

Several from his crew bought beta blockers to slow down their heartbeat. He said it was very helpful unless you had some form of physical activity later...

1466;"It's all in the art of holding your breath, your weapon familiarity as it relates to your body, and how controlled you feel. 

I guess there are statistics that say that Navy SEALS don't face nearly the same amount of stress or PTSD as say someone in a forward operating base like Restrepo in Afghanistan. One is the attacker and has command over the battlefield. The other is the furthest tip that pokes the hornets nest.

I can see why the best snipers feel calm and know how their body works. You also have to be willing to shit your pants and wait excruciatingly long but in the end the wait is most of the battle for a good sniper to perform.

&gt;The management and the employees both ate their in the lunchroom. Like everyone else, we picked up our utensils and went to the window where they give out the meals, they put our food on our plates, and we went back to whatever table we chose, and once we had eaten that dish we could repeat the procedure and get another dish. It was a democratic arrangement. I think the management was deliberately trying to make a demonstration of democracy, and I admit that I liked it very much. In my speeches later on [back in the USSR] I promoted and encouraged this kind of food service for our factories: there was nothing superfluous anywhere in the operation. The surface of the tables in the lunchroom was plastic. All you had to do was wipe it with a damp cloth and the table was clean.

&gt;I was informed that the director of the factory also ate in that lunchroom. Unfortunately, in our country at many factories there are separate lunchrooms for the management and for the workers. A huge staff of service personnel has to be kept up. The service is no better for all that; actually, it’s worse. There are long waiting lines constantly, and the workers mutter their dissatisfaction against the way the lunch break is organized. That’s why I recommended to the leaders of our party and trade-union organizations that they adopt this American system."

&gt;Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain,  tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert,  a pudding the color of honey. I try to imagine assembling this meal  myself back home. Chickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a  wild turkey. I'd need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange.  Goat's milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the  garden.  I'd have to get wild onions from the woods. I  don't recognize the grain, our own tessera ration cooks down to an  unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the  baker, perhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the pudding, I can't  even guess what's in it. Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal  and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version.

1607;Thats a really fucked up statistic. Based on that Trump should start bombing pharmaceutical companies. 
1608;"There are many reasons for this. 

When I was a pharm tech, we had lots of patients who had many different doctors and their doctors would prescribe similar medications without knowing their full profile (one guy was prescribed glyburide, glimepride, and glipizide which pretty much do the same thing for diabetes and he would’ve died at some point had we not caught that).

Doctors are also idiots. They know absolutely nothing about medication, especially new medications. I commonly had to call doctors and be like, “I need to alter this script because this isn’t the medication or dosage they take.” Favorite was when one doctor wrote for Lyrica 10mg. “Dr. Johnson, Lyrica doesn’t come in 10mg.” “It doesn’t?” “No, sorry, sir.” “Eh, just give them what I normally give them.”

Patients are also stupid. The amount of times I’ve had people come in and be like, “I need more of my _____.” “Ma’am you still have a week left until we can refill that. What happened to the rest of them?” “I wasn’t feeling well so I just took extras.”

So yeah, there’s nothing the FDA can really do about this except education. Educating the doctors on medications so they can educate their patients. Lots of doctors don’t know which medications interact with each other and so on.

If you have any questions about a medication and you don’t feel like your doctor is 100% right, please call a pharmacy, even if it is not the one you go to. A pharmacist or tech would be very happy to counsel and make sure that what you are taking is correct for you."

1648;"Truefact, Bald Eagles actually sound very much like seagulls. Personal experience over a number of years around them. 

One of my favorite pics I've taken of a Bald Eagle was when it was being mobbled by a single crow flying right at it's head. The eagle's eyes are wide with fear and I titled the pic 'Pay Attention!'

1649;"*bald eagles

"
1650;"Sorry I wasn't clear. Crew drove all around Juneau outskirts looking for wild Eagles. Only eagle found was at raptor rehab center. Cool close ups of head but showing that one wing had been shot off (!) didn't work for project. Rehab people pointed us to dump. Hours before we were to leave went there to find the trees around the dump filled with bald eagles of all sizes. Young. Old. Got great shots of soaring thru the sky birds but every wide shot revealed piles of garbage.   

Side note- I picked up an eagle feather from ground at the dump and was going to take it home. Left it after being told was a crime. "
1651;"While it's true that female eagles are larger than males, most people, unless they're very experienced eagle watchers, can only tell the difference when the two are side by side. So ""most of the eagles pictured are females"" is a bit of an exaggeration."
1652;"Yeah the bald eagle isn't much of an eagle

1653;I wish Ben Franklin had his way... having a Turkey as the national symbol/bird would have been way better.
1654;Ok but it feels nice on my light holes
1655;"&gt; What isn’t speculative is that the plain white light coming off your iPad is very bad for your sleep, severely mucking up your biological clock. 


So the TL;DR here is that while it’s proven that white light will affect sleep patterns, they haven’t conclusively proven that color-shifting it is any better (although the article is a year old)."
1656;" I know a research professor studying this with blue blocking glasses and his research has been promising. It suggests that yes, blue light keeps you awake.

Does your phone screen remove or reduce blue light with the filter? The glasses were tested in a physics lab to ensure the  blocked the right wavelength(s). The professor distributed a bunch to colleagues and their spouses and had one spouse wear them and one not, both keeping sleep journals. This allowed for matched subjects with identical sleeping conditions.

According to what I learned in that class... most subjects reported better sleep quality and faster sleep onset when wearing the glasses. And the professor himself wears them to better adjust his waking times when he travels across the globe to teach.

Is it a 2000 person study with biological specimens and lab settings? Nope. That'd be almost impossible to get up and running. 

I'm all for blue blocking goggles and dark rooms. From what I have experienced...they work!"
1657;I work third shift. If the light coming in the window isn't gonna mess me up then my phone screen sure as shit ain't doing anything.
1658;That's all the proof I need, bye bye blue light filter.
1659;They have stories about ancient, fantastic sounding creatures that everyone assumed were just myths until they started finding skeletons that matched the descriptions. shit's crazy
1660;Oral tradition is very interesting. If you take it literally, sometimes it makes little sense. Taken figuratively, it can teach beautiful things. Thanks for sharing.
1661;Reminds of the theory that the Black Sea flooding was the origin of several deluge myths, at least within a certain chronological and geographical scope. Must have been a truly awe-inspiring sight.
1662;I read a publication a few years ago with an interview of an older aboriginal women who gave a perfect account of a cave within the Julian Rocks in Byron Bay. She gave this account before the invention of diving equipment around one hundred years ago. The story had been passed down before the beginning of the Holocene interglacial period before the area was submerged due to ocean level rise more than 10,000 years ago. Mind blowing stuff. 
1663;"Just going to point out that, in terms of actual scholarly activity, oral traditions are incredibly accurate. The idea that it's unreliable and a game of telephone is a modern fiction and myth, ironically.

Does that mean there was a man with a boat surviving a worldwide flood? No it means there was a man with a boat. For them the world was just the middle east. Why would you assume worldwide when they never traveled beyond their part of the world?

Or even more curious *tin foil hat time*...maybe the flood myths of the west are not water at all. Maybe they are naturalized stories of the **sea people** destroying the Bronze age civilizations. A worldwide flood, but not of water. Of a new culture.

EDIT:

The reason I speculate on the Sea Peoples chapter of history, is because many ancient peoples used the sea to represent human collective identity, and things which come out of the sea (such as animals as is the case in the bible) represent nations which that collective identity manifest as. So if it's fairly consistent that the sea represents human cultural potential, that the sea rising up and destroying civilization matches pretty spot on with the events of the Sea Peoples's invasion preceding the Bronze Age collapse."
1664;"The invaders changed all that: ""Aboriginal people learned from their stories that a society must not be human-centred but rather land centred, otherwise they forget their source and purpose ... humans are prone to exploitative behaviour if not constantly reminded they are interconnected with the rest of creation, that they as individuals are only temporal in time, and past and future generations must be included in their perception of their purpose in life."""
1665;Growing up i learnt the aboriginal myths for land formation in my area. They were usually from dead giants, witch doctors, or giant animals or snakes. After school i spent a year travelling the rest of the country and the stories of how their land masses were formed are very similar themed.
1666;This is used in Hawaii as well. Hawaii volcanoes national park scientists overlap their findings with ancient oral moolelo and find they mirror or support each other

1682;"Donald Duck was a much more mature character than we know today. The original Donald Duck was a great depression widower with 4 kids, and a rich brother (Scrooge McDuck) who never helped him. His speech impediment was from a stroke suffered from breathing too much coal everyday for years. He went to war for country, so his children had something to be proud of, and money. Donald Duck was highly respected and this brough adults to go to war easier. Children weren't allowed to watch Donald Duck, even after they censored out his bulge in his feathers.

1689;Smart move. It provided a solid segue from comedy  to drama. He had a short yet good run with his more serious roles.
1690;That would have been amazing, but it worked out for everyone. Liar Liar was a great movie, and Austin Powers was brilliant with the duel roles. In both cases, both actors were given the chance to show a range they hadn't been about to showcase previously.

1697;Well yeah. Have you ever been on a cruise? Elderly people everywhere. That's even the retirement plan for some. Cruise around the world 24/7/365 until they die.
1698;Kinda sounds like a no brainer I guess
1699;Can confirm.  I used to drive the ambulance at a cruise port town.  They would often call ahead and have us waiting to assist in transferring the “yellow bags” to the morgue.
1700;Keep in mind that *a lot* of cruise passengers are in their twilight years, and most face a lot more activity on the cruise than they are used to at home.  I would imagine that a death (or three) is not an uncommon occurrence.
1701;I was on a cruise in Alaska with my family when I was a kid, and I saw a body bag on a stretcher getting unloaded onto an ambulance. I think this happens fairly frequently because a lot of the passengers are old.
1702;TIL that hanawasakura read [this AskReddit post about Cruise Ships from earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8df0y2/cruise_ship_staff_of_reddit_cleaners_in/) and then made a TIL post about it.
1703; My mil died on a cruise between Jamaica and the Bahamas, from an asthma attack that induced a heart attack.  She and her friend had gotten off at port and bought a brick of weed and smoked it causing said asthma attack , or rather four, the fifth one killed her. She went to the Morgue on ship until the returned to Florida.  It’s also common that if you are the companion  of the deceased person , carrying the luggage of the deceased person, they do not check your bags and the remnants of the brick you purchased can be stowed in said luggage  and  brought home  to enjoy later. 
1704;In other situations bodies are kept in freezers and refrigerators used for food storage, so I can understand why that might be frowned upon for a cruise ship. 
1705;I just dreamt last night there was a mass shooting on a cruise I was on. This is interesting to know.
1706;as a necrophobic, I will need to know where this is and stay the fuck away from it. that is if I can afford a cruise. 
1707;seems fair
1708;Huh, never really thought about it before but it makes sense, imagine if they just left the bodies where they died til you got back and docked lol.
1709;Well that didn't take long
1710;I discovered the hard way that Cruise ships have a jail too.
1711;You legit learned this from another Reddit post... what is wrong with ppl
1712;They also often keep them on until the final stop.
1713;I’m assuming this was after an incident where they had to keep a body in the cooler with the food.
1714;"I learned this a few years ago: a woman went overboard from the top deck. Everyone went to the decks to look for her before she was sighted and the crew dropped the boats to retriever her body. My placement was such that I was between the boat ... crane? So me and another guy were stuck on the deck while the rest of the passengers were asked to move inside for headcount. 

We pretty much watched the whole ""recovery"" operation. Sure enough, she was loaded into a body bag but they had a damned hard time zipping it and had to ... rearrange her. Was my 2nd and will be my very last cruise."
1715;People die, it's part of life. Is it really a surprise they have a place for bodies?
1716;its usually next to the jail on deck 0.
1717;That would make sense. With a large number of guests, many of them elderly, you are bound to have a stiff one every once in a while. The alternatives would be forced burial at sea or returning to home port.
1718;Every ship that has 50+ passengers is required to have a hospital and a doctor. 
1719;another reason I dont take cruises. 
1720;Totally believable, we had a murder on my cruise last summer and I guess the best thing to do is to be prepared.
1721;I used to research charges that showed up on people’s credit cards after they died. Cruise ship charges weren’t unusual because the families would treat themselves to a vacation on grandma’s card. Ran into one that had charges around the DOD. To prove that they were legit charges, I got sent a ton of stuff from the cruise line showing the latitude and longitude and all sorts of other info. It was weird. 
1722;I thought you were allowed to chop up the bodies of passengers and dump them overboard to bury them at sea?
1723;I guess they need a skeleton crew.
1724;Get travelers insurance folks. Getting sick abroad is expensive. Getting airlifted off a ship is incredibly expensive.
1725;"Title should read ""inevitable death"". Tons of old folks die on cruise ships. It's cheaper to live on a cruise ship than in a retirement community. TV sucks on cruise ships though"
1726;"I worked on cruise ships and the morgue was usually near the crew laundry. It would get full on cruises out of Miami because of all the oldies cruising. 

There is also a brig (small prison cell) on board."

He was practicing on the squash court until around 10:30 (less then an hour and a half before the collision) on the night of the sinking but retired to the smoking room. When the impact happened he rushed outside and was one of the few to actually see the iceberg as the ship scraped by. He described the iceberg as rising ""a hundred feet above the deck.""

I will note that I don't understand why computers aren't 100% metric. Why do we use #6-32 screws and M3 screws in the same case? Personal computers weren't popular until post 1970's."
1747;"Per the [Metric Conversion Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_Conversion_Act) Metric is the “preferred” measurement system for commerce and trade in the United States but US Customary measurements are permitted. 

The law explicitly states conversion is voluntary NOT mandatory.

The referenced executive order only applies to executive agencies, not the general public. 

None of the referenced materials support the statement SI is the official measurement system of the United States. The convention of the meter only recognizes the meter, the 1975 law only establishes a preference for commerce and trade ONLY yet still permits US Customary measurements and conversion was voluntary, the executive order applies only to agencies under the Executive Branch of the US Government. 

The US has no official system of measurement, but the US Customary Measurement is the only system used in common practice in the United States. "

1766;"For anyone else confused about why not having these hooks leads to tons of discarded dead fish.

&gt;	Bluefin populations have declined precipitously, and bluefin fishing is prohibited in the gulf. But the bluefin, which spawn there, are sometimes snared accidentally by long-line fishermen. Tuna fishing vessels are allowed to retain some bluefin caught accidentally, depending on the pounds of the intended catch on board. 

Bluefin are endangered so it’s illegal to fish them unless you catch them accidentally. To prevent everyone from “accidentally” catching a ton of Bluefin they are only allowed to keep a certain number of pounds of accidentally caught Bluefin. This amount is determined by the total poundage of their Yellowfin catch. So if you catch (these poundages are made up) 1,000 pounds of Yellowfin and 2,000 pounds of Bluefin you can only bring back a small percent of 1,000 pounds in Bluefin. So all the other Bluefin get dumped back into the sea."

1786;The problem with that one percent is that you end up living with your face blown off, so that's a no for me.  Death by snu-snu it is.
1787;"Hey, OP, I don't know if you're considering suicide, but if you are,  or if anyone reading this is, I feel I ought to share a little bit of what I learned when I came close to suicide a couple of years ago. 

I remember that when I was about to pull the trigger, I didn't really want to die. What I wanted was for my problems to disappear, and dying was the only way I could think of to make that happen. If there's still some part of you that sees some value in staying alive, try to remember that there are still ways to reduce your pain and increase your happiness.

The most important thing to do is to figure out is what needs to happen in order for you to not feel suicidal anymore. For me it was finding some way to fill the hole that my wife left. You may be suffering loss too, or you may be suffering from something that is completely different. Whatever your problem is, think about how to solve it, and make that your goal. Keep that goal in mind every day; never forget it.

It will take you a long time get there. I remember receiving a lot of advice and therapy from people who had never experienced depression and who seemed to believe that curing depression was a matter of spouting the correct truism or of convincing you that your problems were all internal. They're wrong. Usually there's no easy fix for depression. It's a natural response to external stressors, and it takes hard work to improve. While you're working toward your goal, do whatever you need to do, take whatever short term boosts of happiness you can take, to keep struggling forward, as long as those short term solutions don't create long term problems. I played a lot of video games to distract myself from real life problems. You might want to hang out with friends, exercise, build a giant block of cheese, whatever. Stay away from opioid and alcohol abuse though, and don't quit your job or school. Like I said, short terms solutions shouldn't create long term problems.

Finally, if you have a psychiatrist, just take the pills. They don't change who you are, they don't dull your (positive) emotions, and they aren't habit forming. Please don't listen to bullshit like We Happy Few from people who have never had to struggle with mental illness. Antidepressants have been a significant help to me. They affect everyone differently, but theres nothing insidious about them.

If anyone wants to PM me, I am happy to offer whatever meager help I can. I remember resenting the idea that I ought not have any choice over the length and valuation of my own life, and you may feel the same way. But if you are a human being, there is almost certainly someone out there who would hurt to lose you. That alone is reason enough to stagger forward, one day at a time."

1851;"I don't buy that.  There'd be some sort of fossil record.

However, the concept that humanity may have had some grand civilization that collapsed in on itself and sent us back to caveman living isn't that difficult to imagine."
1852;"Note that it's not as likely to happen again *after* us; at least, I don't think any later intelligent species could fail to notice the impact we've had.

Even if all of our works crumble to dust before another intelligent civilization arises again, that civilization is going to have a harder go of it. Why? Because we mined all the mineral resources out of the ground. Trees will regrow, fish will repopulate, but ready stores of iron and coal and oil aren't going back into the ground.

Not to mention all the fuckin' geosynchronous satellites. Those will be there for millions of years."

1861;"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.
"
1862;Does that mean if we were to feed a baby human koala feces they would be able to eat eucalyptus leaves when they got older?
1863;I was wondering why baby koalas always had a shit eating grin.
1864;You'd think they'd be immune to it by now...
1865;So, what did the first Koala that ate eucalyptus do if it didn't have a mother from whom to extract post-processed eucalyptus?
1866;Don't elephant babies have to do the same?

If they don't have the same fridge or an alternative, you can get 20% of your money back (the 20% that you expected it to last, but it didn't).

It essentially violates the laws of classical physics, which dictate local causality - particles are acted on by things directly around them, and that's the only way forces happen. It's basically how everyone thinks about physics - and we've found proof that it's not always true.

There is good evidence, that the English robin can sense magnetic fields, even small ones, very well with an internal kind of quantum magnetometer. Basically a molecule pair which can detect magnetic fields of low intensity with great accuracy.

Our Q magnetometers cost millions to build, a large team to maintain and can weigh tons.

The English Robin's efficiency is thus more than a billion fold ours.

2074;"Yeah I remember being bummed reading about a vet in Taiwan who killed herself with the same drugs used to put dogs to sleep. 

As someone who loves cats and dogs, I get sad just reading about their mistreatment (wasn't there a cat who walked for miles recently to be reunited with his owners, just to be put up for euthanasia?); I can only imagine how wretched an animal lover must be to deal with actual mistreated pets. 

"
2075;"My wife just left the veterinary field after 10yrs. Within a week she's already way happier with her new job.

2078;I believe it. I worked at a large and small animal vet clinic for almost a year and needed therapy for my legit PTSD. I had images and memories that kept playing on repeat, of horrible things I’d seen. I did EMDR and it helped calm those cycles immensely. 
2079;"People think we're depressed solely because of the euthanasias we perform.    That's only a small part of it.  The worst part is dealing with callous, abusive, mean, cruel *people*, mostly but not always pet owners.

2080;"I believe this. When I had to get my cat Maggie put down, I kept talking to her like she had any idea what I was saying (""remember when you brought that pigeon home and you were so proud but it wasn't dead and mom freaked out"" ""I'm sorry that I bonked you on the head that one time when I was 8, I love you and I hope you don't forget it"" stuff like this) and I was bawling my eyes out, the vet gave her the shot and started crying too. It really affected the vet, especially since I brought Maggie in on a weekend when they were closed (Maggie was having bad seizures and every other vet I called said they'd put her down and I could be on with my day) and she'd been with my cat all weekend trying to get her seizures under control. I was so grateful to her, for trying everything she could to make sure my kitty came home and in the end I know it wasn't her fault that Maggie wasn't going to get better but she still took it personally. I could barely go through something like that the one time, but she has to do these kinds of things on nearly a daily basis. I should send her a gift, let her know she's appreciated."

2089;"I have a 7 year old pound dog who is the most accident prone animal I have ever met. We have spent thousands on him. 

The last time was a couple of months ago. He gave himself a huge gash on his shoulder/chest area. I took him to the emergency vet around 9pm, he stayed overnight and had surgery, and I picked him up the next day.

2097;Well I know what I'm headed towards
2098;I'm pretty sure this came up on top gear once. One of them basically explained it as people becoming vets because they love animals, and then their job is putting animals down.
2099;I have worked at 2 vet hospitals and I have worked in the animal field for over 10 years. I know personally that the highest reason for sadness and frustration at least for me is the high percentage of neglect. Most people don't even know they're doing it, and when they find out their pet needs treatment, they don't get it fixed. I'm a groomer, and not a SINGLE day in my career has gone by without at least one dog on my schedule having fixable issues. Whoever is reading this if you have a dog: look up what healthy teeth look like, how to recognize an ear infection, and what nails should look like. Nails should be done once a month. Check your dog over regularly for issues, and get them fixed! Look for low cost pet care places if you have to, just please for the sake of your pet, get it done!
2100;horrid clientele 
2101;I honestly think that people may have some sort of different response to animals getting hurt. Probably moreso in Western culture because of the prevalence of pets in family's.
2102;I mean, you treat Good Boys... and sometimes you need to put them down. Wouldn't prison guards and policemen be depressed too if for some strange reason all people they shoot and execute were clearly Good People? 
2103;Ditto dentists 
2104;I wonder if vets are more likely to be vegetarian? And if not, do they rationalize that choice?
2105;And the Vietnamese ones may be even higher than that. Vietnam seems to have a lot more sick animals than average
2106;Sucks. Also, hard to get to causation from correlation.
2107;Maybe it's the student loans, Those guys go so far into debt :(
2108;I work in animal care, specifically with no kill-shelters in the second highest kill rate county in the states. I've been doing it for 5 years. Animal care drains you like nothing else, I had to take a 3 month break because I was so overwhelmed. It has definitely worsened my anxiety and depression and thoughts of suicide are a lot more frequent now than they were before I started. I am not a vet, but animal care workers (specifically shelters and rescues both small and large) are also affected by this which is something not a lot of people talk about. Thankfully, the place I work recognizes it and routinely puts out sections in the weekly newsletter about self care and taking breaks. 
2109;Who would have thought jerking off pigs makes you depressed 
2110;Small animal vets can spend up to 50% of their practice putting animals to death. How horrible would that be.     
2111;What about those who don't work with cats?
2112;The suicide rates are mainly down to their ease of access to drugs and the knowledge of how to use them effectively. It's a ridiculously tough job to do.
2113;Systematic murder will do that to you, if you're not a psychopath. 
2114;"I think this is due to the type of people who become vets.  I dated a girl for 3 years during which she was in vet school.  A whole lot of mental instability there.  A lot of them were depressed from the start.

If someone wants to do a study they could get a PhD out of it."

More generally, no one has ever provided any evidence that diseases like mass hysteria or ""motor hysteria"" even exist. Yes, the symptoms seem to be unexplainable by any currently known organic disease, but no, this does in not prove that there is *no* underlying organic cause — just that we don't know it yet. History is full with symptoms that were first attributed to psychosomatism, but were later were found to have an organic cause (e.g. epilepsy, Helicobacter pylori)."

Hopefully some first responders will chime in because my experience is from heresay... but apparently the Hispanic culture tends to be more dramatic and eager to accept the worse possible case scenario for any given affliction. I've heard both police and fire talk about this phenomenon and it is understood that there's nothing medically wrong with these people, but it's impossible to convince them of that fact and they end up ""treating"" the person for symptoms. I'd love to hear from a first responder if THEY have experienced this as well."
2134;Stuff you should know did an episode on it
2135;I once had something similar happen to me. I was reading up on the Internet on some minor medical issue (don't recall what it was) and right after I read about the symptoms I started feeling those exact symptoms. I think in this case though, that my brain was hiding the symptom from me and refocused to that part of the body. This is something different than the original article.

One day he went into the lab pretty late and he found the cleaning lady laying on the floor playing with all of the baby monkeys, and when he asked her what she was doing, she said something like ""everyone knows if you don't give them any attention, they're gonna be screwed up anyways.""

2157;I find the conclusion of these experiments questionable. In the methods section it says room was freezing cold and there was a heat lamp in the cloth Mommy. Maybe it's not so much that monkeys prefer love over food but that freezing to death presents a more imminent danger. The Monkees did visit the wire mommy enough to feed.
2158;"&gt;The experiments were condemned, both at the time and later, from within the scientific community and elsewhere in academia. In 1974, American literary critic Wayne C. Booth wrote that ""Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties."" He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.[12]

&gt;Charles Snowdon, a junior member of the faculty at the time, who became head of psychology at Wisconsin, said that Harlow had himself been very depressed by his wife's cancer. Snowdon was appalled by the design of the vertical chambers. He asked Suomi why they were using them, and Harlow replied, ""Because that's how it feels when you're depressed.""[13] Leonard Rosenblum, who studied under Harlow, told Lauren Slater that Harlow enjoyed using shocking terms for his apparatus because ""he always wanted to get a rise out of people"".[14]

&gt;Another of Harlow's students, William Mason, who also conducted deprivation experiments elsewhere,[15] said that Harlow ""kept this going to the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities, that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive. It's as if he sat down and said, 'I'm only going to be around another ten years. What I'd like to do, then, is leave a great big mess behind.' If that was his aim, he did a perfect job.

tl;dr Harlow was a sadist"

We bought it since between us we had a bunch of other systems so why not.  Unfortunantely after 10 minutes or so it would induce terrible headaches and eye strain.  

Eventually it would end up in my college apartment which would always have random people hanging out in it after the bars or parties got out.  There would always be one drunk person who would ask what it is, we would explain and warn them but they would try anyways.  We call kept doing whatever we were doing while the new person would stay in the corner with their eyes buried deep in the Virtual Boy.

Eventually 8-12 minutes later you'd just here ""Fuuuuuuck"" as they took their face out."

2227;"Here's a bit of information that the morons who do this do not seem to comprehend.

The smoke is generated in the combustion chamber (in a 4-stroke engine, during the 3rd phase) then pushed out the exhaust.  Now this smoke is actually little tiny bits of carbon.  A lot of that carbon gets ejected during the 4th stroke, but some of it gets trapped in the oil.  Your engine has an oil filter to catch bits of carbon from normal burning.  When you increase the amount of carbon (like rolling coal), you're increasing the amount of shit the filter has to catch.  For most of these diesels, that increase is at least 100 times more soot than normal.  This means that filter is going to clog up faster and not do it's job (also allowing any other bits your oil normally picks up to not get filtered).  If that happens, then you get all these little bits floating in your oil.  If you don't know how that's bad, rub a grain of sand on the back of your hand, then run a piece of sandpaper on the back of your hand, they're just tiny bits of sand, a few bits doesn't do much (like a normal engine with clean oil) but a lot of bits does some damage fast (like dirty oil).  That oil lubricates the cylinder walls, when it's loaded with soot, it wears it down, fast.  As it wears down those walls, the engine loses compression, and thus, power.  You can prevent it from losing a lot by more frequent oil and filter changes, but that means probably changing out every 500 miles.

This is why it is highly recommended to have any diesel vehicle run a compression test before you buy one used.  I was looking at trucks last year and found a 2013 F-250 that I liked.  When I went to look at it, the truck had just done an oil change a few days before, that's usually a red flag.  I took the truck for a test drive and just drove it to a mechanic and did a compression test, it failed (less than 100psi on each of the 8 cylinders).  It wasn't just a little bit bad, there should be more than 100psi on each cylinder, this truck had one cylinder above 30psi.  That truck was 5 years old, either that oil change a few days before testing was it's first ever, or it had been ""rolling coal"" by someone who didn't know how bad that is on the engine.  My guess is the ""rolling coal"" as the truck had one of those 8 inch diameter exhaust tips on aftermarket exhaust pipes.  I didn't buy that truck, they wouldn't come down in price to what the vehicle was worth (which was about 1/4th what they were asking).

The point is, rolling coal can be very damaging to the engine.  You can take good care of it and delay that damage, but you can't prevent it.  The difference between taking care of a normal diesel and one modified to blow smoke is like the difference between taking care of a pet goldfish versus having a kid."
2228;[This] (https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/8dqcjj/video_of_a_driver_in_dundalk_rolling_coal_on_kids/) just happened near Baltimore. I've never heard the term before, and thought someone was literally dumping coal out of the side of the truck.

When the light changed, the truck gunned it and blew a cloud of soot on the car, then raced up a hill. I caught him at the next light, where he was making a left turn, so I pulled alongside him. He looked over at me, so I stared directly at him, then slowly, deliberately, raised my arm and flipped him off. He FREAKED, screaming, swearing, pounding his steering wheel.

I picked up a piece of fried chicken and slowly ate it, smiling, while he continued to rant, telling me to pull over into the gas station on the corner. When the turn arrow went green,  he roared off into the gas station. When My light went green, I slowly drove right past him.

2361;"A few years ago I realized that my entire opinion about the Michael Jackson drama was based on non-facts. Just rumor/hearsay. So I went online and did a fair amount of digging and found that they never really produced any hard evidence to convict him.

Now, I'm not saying that he was innocent beyond a shadow of a doubt. But if we're going to even try to live in a civilized society we have to operate on the notion that everyone is innocent until PROVEN guilty. It's very possible, seeing how wealthy he was, that the accusers were simply leeches attempting to get their hands on what they could. If I remember correctly, one of the accusing fathers ended up admitting he was trying to sue Jackson to obtain money to invest in the production of Robin Hood: Men In Tights. The most ""solid"" argument I think I've ever heard was that Jackson settled in court, so he must be guilty, which means absolutely nothing. Settling in court is not an admission of guilt. Many people settle because it ends up being less expensive than continuing to pay for legal aid, as well as closing the case to get it out of the public eye, which is important for public figures.

It was just an interesting lesson for me about how far rumor and speculation can go in regards to ruining someone's life. Was he guilty? I don't know, but no evidence shows it. So that's that. Even within the last couple years I've heard people refer to him as a child molester, and when asked what evidence they base that assertion on, I just hear crickets.

Are there any other aircrafts that are similarly ""retired""?"
2393;"The article doesn't say they must fly every 4 years, it says they must be ""re-preserved"" every 4 years. The preservation process is described below from a different source:

&gt;The next stop for a newly inducted aircraft is the flush farm where the fuel system is purged. Replacing the fuel with 10/10-weight oil, each engine is run up briefly and shut down. The oil is then drained. This process leaves a residual protective film in the tanks, fuel lines, and engines. Oxygen, hydraulic, and pneumatic systems are also preserved. The aircraft then goes to the wash rack where it is thoroughly cleaned.

&gt;Aircraft preservation follows. Large seams, joints, and control surfaces, as well as canopies, windows, and openings on the upper half of the aircraft are taped over and barrier paper installed to keep moisture out.

&gt;A thick black layer of sprayed-on latex, called Spraylat, is then applied. This serves as the preservative layer. White Spraylat is then put on top of the black Spraylat to provide temperature control. The white Spraylat keeps the aircraft interior ten to fifteen percent cooler than the outside temperature. A relatively recent innovation is that on many larger aircraft, breathing tubes—PVC pipes pointed toward the ground—are installed to ensure interior air circulation.

&gt;“Every 180 days each aircraft is checked for whatever animal or bird would like to make its home inside,” noted Pittman. “We check the seals on the Spraylat and the plane’s overall general condition.

2396;I work with children in low income housing and we do field trips throughout the year.  The most fun they had was attending the Nutcracker Ballet at Christmastime.  They were so excited to go to an event that their parents could never afford on their own.  These experiences may not appear to immediately “do anything to help the poor kids” but they absolutely do work to positively shape the children’s worldview and expand their interests.  One child was so enamored with the ballet, that I worked with her mom to get a scholarship so she can take dance lessons.  The child wouldn’t have even thought of dance as an interest before being exposed.

2461;Actually, pressed discs have the data encoded in pits on the label side that the shiny label then fills. Recordable discs have the data encoded in the plastic in the form of laser darkened dye.

2463;"On a mass produced disk like the one shown the metal layer has lands and pits. The info is on the metallic layer. The plastic was used as a mold to form the applied metal. The laser reads the metal's surface.

Metal master pressed into &gt; plastic (plastic acquires bumps)&gt; New metal layer applied to plastic gets pits from bumps in the plastic.


Recordable CD &amp; DVDs &amp; blu-rays do have a flat metal layer and fake pits floating in a dye layer. A laser exposed the dye and makes dark spots in the plastic. The info is really in the plastic for recordables."
2464;"TIL ""HowIt'sMade"" had an anchor"
2465;"In that case, I'm surprised that the relatively cheap solution of adding a ridge around the bottom edge to keep the disc raised from surfaces wasn't developed as either a part of the disk or a third party product.  Considering people will normally pay for decent upgrades (looking at VHS -&gt; DVD -&gt; Blu-Ray as an example) it could have even been marketed as a second generation CD, leading to increased sales during the CD slump."
2466;Also, barcode scanners don't scan the black part. They scan the white space BETWEEN the black lines.
2467;"I once had a ps game ( delta force I believe ) that lost nearly all of its shiny parts. It still worked without a problem.

But my others games stopped working after little scratches. Aaah, medal of honor. Stopped working the first day of holiday. "
2468;While true, it's slightly misleading on how scratches and other things affect the disc. The data is stamped into the plastic of the disc on the same side as the shiny label. This is why scratching the non-label side isn't destructive to the disc (unless it's deep gouges) and can even be buffed out, scratching the label side will almost always destroy the data on the disc because that side of the plastic has all the data stamped into it.

2480;"On the one he actually made, he got the inbound pass with 2 seconds on the clock before half, heaved it up and somehow it went in at the buzzer.

So it was a 3-pointer, but it wasn’t *really*"

They would have people stationed on three different levels all the way to the 255 foot level. We were given air horns and a water hose to scare the birds away if any got too close. They also used fake predator birds stationed around the structure which had to be moved around so the birds wouldn't ignore them. Also large inflatable beach-ball like things with large eyes painted on them. Not the most exciting job in the world but the view from the 255 level with the orbiter on the pad was pretty incredible.

I used to eat at McDonald's fairly frequently because it was the only fast food restaurant along my drive to and from the base I was stationed at. When I figured out that beef was a problem, I switched to chicken sandwiches. The fries were delicious, though, so I'd keep getting meal deals.

2733;"Not ""evidence of innocence"". Most often simply new evidence significant enough to warrant a new trial considering that the courts fully respect the significance of the death penalty and exercise extreme caution by giving the convicts every benefit of the doubt.

There are all these organizations that help death penalty defendants by scouring their cases for any discrepancy or any technicality that could justify a retrial, even ones that don't necessarily indicate that the defendant is innocent. 10+ years after the original conviction, prosectors are often reluctant to retry the cases. Often there are witnesses that won't want to testify anymore, and in new trials the memories of their witnesses that agree to testify will be called into question after all those years. Plus, they already locked the guy up for however many years, it is a partial victory. So they just decline to retry the defendant. And then the ""innocence project"" writes a press release saying that ""they saved an innocent man from death row"" and the media ignorantly parrots their spin. More often than not, these people are still guilty of their crime."

Most of current death row inmates are minority men who frequently have dubious convictions; honestly, many of them should be commuted to life. A jury of your peers doesn't mean a group of old white people if you're a black man. As much as we aspire and pretend that equality exists, it doesn't, so sending someone to their death when the group of people are biased against you isn't justice."

In a unanimous opinion, **the court ruled that all of Sierra Pacific’s accusations were legally insufficient, because it ""voluntarily settled instead of going to trial” and “bound [itself] not to seek future relief.”** **In addition, the court explained that the accusations of misconduct that Sierra Pacific claimed to have learned of after the settlement “do not constitute fraud on the court,”** and it was not a fraud for government counsel “to have their own theory of the case and discuss it with their witnesses.”

They were forced to settle even thought they were at fault. So yes the court fucked them over.

The court committed fraud and when the company found out about it the court all of a sudden said we did not commit fraud.

So basically they investigated themselves for fraud and even though they committed massive amounts of fraud they found no wrongdoing.

Even though they were ordered to pay 32 million dollars no t only did they appeal it they forced an innocent company to take the blame and forced them to pay 55 million dollars while the courts committed massive fraud on behalf of the state.

&gt;**On October 9, 2014 Sierra Pacific and other defendants filed a motion in Federal Court to terminate the settlement on the grounds that the investigation and prosecution were flawed and corrupt. As a result, on October 14, 2014 Chief Judge of the Eastern District of California Morrison C. England issued an order which referred the case to Alex Kozinski, then-Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for the assignment of a judge outside of the Eastern District of California to assure impartiality. Judge Kozinski declined to appoint a judge outside of the Eastern District to hear the case, which was then reassigned to Senior District Judge William B. Shubb, who issued an order denying the motion on April 17, 2015.**

Yea if this does not sound like corruption and fraud I do not know what does.

They asked for it to be moved outside of california so it would be a fair trial but they were denied.

Yep sounds like fraud and corruption.

&gt;The court ruled: ""Defendants have failed to identity even a single instance of fraud on the court, certainly none on the part of any attorney for the government. They repeatedly argue that fraud on the court can be found by considering the totality of the allegations. Here, the whole can be no greater than the sum of its parts. Stripped of all its bluster, defendants’ motion is wholly devoid of any substance.""

The mere fact it was not allowed ot be moved out of california is enough to prove fraud and corruption.

First of all, I also highly recommend The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). It's black and white and silent but the actress - Renée Jeanne Falconetti - gives a command performance. Part of this performance is that the director was a cruel bastard who abused her to get the proper reaction. For instance, there are stories that the director forced her to kneel painfully on a stone over and over but to hide her emotion when being filmed. This resulted in her showing honest hidden pain behind her eyes. The movie is fantastic and has a very realistic ending even for today's special effects.

The movie deserves proper attention and I can think of no greater honor than buying it on [Criterion](https://www.criterion.com/films/228-the-passion-of-joan-of-arc) where they fixed the video and the sound.

In addition, I highly recommend picking up Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc by Sieur Louis de Conte (1896). I collect antique books and I have the first edition which you can find on Ebay (ok, I might go a *bit* overboard over Joan).

The book is split into 3 parts: her early life, military campaign, and trial.

The interesting bit about the book is that Sieur Louis de Conte is another pseudonym of Mark Twain (which in itself is a pseudonym). He also loved Joan and believed this book was his greatest and most important work. He used the pseudonym because he's known for his non-serious style of writing and he didn't want people to take the book in a similar light."

The evidence was a entry in the City of Orleans register gifting her a large sum years after said execution. BTW they finally busted her for wearing men's clothes re: the prohibition in Levititcus. "
2930;I read Mark Twain's book on her life. His protagonist was a scribe at the trial(s) who also happened to be a friend of Joan's. Twain was a bit obsessed with her it seems. I enjoyed the book greatly.

Gärtner was not an illegal immigrant, since he had been brought to the United States against his will. He had not really escaped from prison because all German POWs were to be repatriated to their original homes and he was due to be sent back to his hometown in Silesia, which had been occupied by the Soviets. Moreover, as he had escaped after the war had ended, there was some question if he was still a prisoner of war. Because of this, he was not charged with any offenses. The FBI announced that it had no further interest in him, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service confirmed it had no interest in deporting him. Gärtner was invited to become an American citizen. Due to bureaucratic delays, it was not until November 2009 that he was finally naturalized as a citizen in South Denver."""

Speaking in a deep and resonant tone, the thief politely ordered the stage driver, a man named John Shine (later a U.S. marshal and a California state senator) , to thrown down the strongbox. When it appeared that the stage driver was hesitating, the robber said “If he dares to shoot, give him the solid volley, boys.” Looking around quickly Shine noticed several rifle barrels pointed at him from the nearby bushes and quickly threw down the strongbox. In the meantime a woman offered to surrender her purse, but the bandit declined, saying that he only wanted the Wells Fargo shipment.*

*As the driver and the passengers looked on, the outlaw hacked open the box and removed several bags of gold coins and a few express packages before fleeing the scene. Afterwards, John Shine went to recover the empty strongbox and upon examining the area, he discovered that the “men with rifles” were actually carefully rigged sticks. The man soon to be known as “Black Bart” had committed his first robbery netting him $160.*


Black Bart was afraid of horses and made all of his robberies on foot. He also never fired his gun in all his years of being an outlaw.

His role is somewhat close to that an adjunct project supervisor, he was a high ranking official helping over the project but not directly over Michelangelo's work.

Michelangelo painted him there the first time da Cesena reported him to the Pope, and the pope was okay with the painting's nudity. According to art-world legend, when da Cesena complained a second time the Pope indicated that the demon was a creature of hell, but as the Pope his authority was in heaven, so it would remain.

It seems like the Pope at the time agreed with Michelangelo's insult, but he was politic enough to not say it as well.

3284;"&gt; Q. Why does my microwave’s turntable switch directions when I stop it and start it again? Does it affect how the food heats?

&gt; A. “The direction of rotation should have no effect on the rate of heating or uniformity of heating for any conceivable food-heating situation,” said Ashim K. Datta, professor of biological engineering at Cornell University.

&gt; Rather, the reversal has to do with the relatively inexpensive turntable motors designed for use in most microwaves, said Robert J. Thomas, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Cornell. By design, they reverse their direction of rotation if a load greater than their output torque, or twisting force, is present, he said.

&gt; “All motors require a starting torque in order to start themselves from zero rotation speed to design speed, with or without a load attached,” Dr. Thomas said. It takes very little torque to rotate the turntable once it is turning, he said, but it can take several times the running torque to start it.

&gt; After a full stop, the drive mechanism is usually pressed against the load in the direction of the last rotation. When the motor encounters the load, it reverses itself and gets a small running start (with no load for a small fraction of time) to pick up speed before engaging the load again.

&gt; The mechanical linkage needed to perform this is much cheaper than the additional windings of copper wire that a stronger motor would require, Dr. Thomas said.  

"
3285;Wow I never even noticed that the turntable switched directions.🤔
3286;"That's mostly right.  I'm not sure that the writer is completely clear on the information presented by the referenced expert.

It would be best to say that it **tends** to reverse direction, because that is usually the easiest direction for the motor to start.  A simple motor has no sensor, no memory, no control, no way of even knowing whether it is rotating clockwise or counterclockwise.

So it will start in whatever direction is easiest.  The easiest direction is **usually** opposite of the previous direction.

But I think that many people can read your post title, and jump to an incorrect conclusion that the motor is designed to remember the previous direction and deliberately start in the opposite direction."
3287;This is one of those facts that I keep running across but, being an idiot, have never understood.
3288;I always thought it was for uniform heating purposes, but this explains why my table seems to jerk from rest before finding a comfortable speed.
3289;Thanks! I've always wondered this
3290;Wow, I've used my microwave hundreds of times and never noticed this.
3291;"Yep pushing right past the previous load...  

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
3292;Wow I never even noticed that the turntable changed directions.🤔
3293;"Simple test: after the turntable stops, manually turn it in the same direction it was just going. That should put the table slightly ""ahead"" of the motor. 
Then when the motor starts, it should be easiest for it to first pick up the slack going forward and then keep going.

Or conversely, if you make sure to rotate the table backwards from its previous direction a bit so it's snugly against the motor, it should make reversing more likely."

3332;"Basically they turn multiplication into addition. Prior to the slide rule, the same thing was done with books filled with logarithm tables. 

The tricky bit is that you have to keep track of the decimal point. Also, on a standard slide rule there are some numbers that go off the end so you would have to reposition the rule to the other side if that makes any sense. That problem doesn't exist on circular slide rules, which just wrap around so you never have to worry about that.

Slide rules are still handy to know how to use, especially if you're doing a lot of conversions by the same factor. Just set the factor, and you basically have a sideways conversion chart.

I collect slide rules and carry one in my pocket at work. It's actually useful sometimes because I work at a facility that doesn't allow cameras, so if I need to do a bit of math I can't just pull out my phone.

[Here's some of my favorite slide rules](https://i.imgur.com/C5eKlpS.jpg), although not the most valuable ones. If I had to guess, I'd say I own about $2500 worth of slide rules that I've collected over the years. If anyone's interested I could dig em out and get more pics."

3338;"To summarize:

* in the beginning, Lincoln's primary desire is to maintain the union, which is to say, to not have a civil war

* to that end, he prefers compensated emancipation (where slaves are freed and the slaveowners financially compensated, just like what the British did with theirs)

* however, the Southern states still refuses this, because their economy is inexplicably tied to slavery. Therefore,

* after the Union victory at the battle at Antietam, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation freeing all slaves held in the Confederacy, and making emancipation the primary purpose of the Union **from that point on**.

3339;That isn't necessarily to say they he felt this way his entire life. I believe a lot of his opinions changed later on, especially after he met Fredrick Douglas.
3340;It's a historical tragedy the South did not negotiate with Lincoln because the Civil War was reallynthe death knell for state's rights.

3346;"Sure he did. That's why he issued the Emancipation Proclamation which ended slavery in 1863 in the Union and then as the South was defeated, there.

Sadly, half truths are often de rigeur in many places."
3347;Yea, and for some reason even in seemingly scholastic historical circles, these days people are really pushing it as totally being about slavery and if you just slavery was a facet you're a racist...it's Fucking Weird. Yea, the South liked them some slaves but it's just one fucking point, even if a large one.
3348;"Dont believe these attempts to re-write history.  The left creams themselves over the idea of shoehirning Lincoln &amp; the Republican party away from the abolishion of slavery.  The Republican party was founded, centerally, on the abolishment of slavery and individual freedom.  The thin-end-of-the-wedge attempts to undermine that fact has been goung on for a couple of decades.  The end of slavery was what  motived Lincoln and the Republican party.

3374;"Lithuanian here; I'm a bit surprised it's a TIL. I wouldn't say synchronised clapping is more popular per se; rather, any long ovation at some point finds a rhythm people clap to, it's quite a smooth transition, and you can find examples of both cases quite easily.

Does that not happen elsewhere? This is the TIL for me..."
3375;"It's a mix here (Poland). Average performances will get random clapping, we also clap randomly if we clap in the middle of the event (i.e. after a particularly spectacular act). However, we sometimes do synchronized clapping at the end of really great performances. It starts random, then changes to synchronized after a while. It's most commonly paired with a standing ovation.

And of course clapping to music is synchronized, but that's a different thing."

3380;I sing in a choir that has done two tours of Ukraine, and I have experienced this. It will usually start off random, then within maybe 30 seconds it will settle into a rhythm. My impression is that somehow the synchronized clapping feels more sincerely appreciative and more enthusiastic than random clapping. Another difference between audiences in Canada and Ukraine is giving flowers to performers. When this happens in Canada, it's strictly at the end of a performance. In Ukraine, audience members will sometimes come on stage mid-performance to give their favourite performer flowers. It's really a beautiful gesture, if sometimes a bit dangerous, if it's in the middle of a dance, for example, where the audience member, unfamiliar with the choreography, could find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.
