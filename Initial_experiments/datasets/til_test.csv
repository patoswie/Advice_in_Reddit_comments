10;"sounds like a rip off. but if you think about over draft is you spending what you don't have
"
11;I got charged for overdrafting because I transfered funds from checkings to savings before my direct deposit actually completed, even though it showed up on my balance. Called customer support and they refused to undo the charge. Fuck you TCF, I'm glad I stopped using your shit bank. 
12;And that's just your wife!
13;Sounded like a good idea when you signed up for it,  right?  So don't cry when you actually do overdraw and get hit with the fee.  Be a responsible adult and pay attention to your available balance.  Dummies deserve fees.
14;"I mean times and warfare and the US army had changed, TR literally wanted to get the rough riders back together again

In case you didn't know the rough riders were the volunteer group he fought with in Vuba

&gt; They gathered a diverse bunch of men consisting of cowboys, gold or mining prospectors, hunters, gamblers, Native Americans and college boys—all of whom were able-bodied and capable on horseback and in shooting. 

Almost literally cowboys and Indians 

This may have been the way America fought the Spanish American war but it would have been madness for WW1

Also TR was 58, having an American president die in a European war wouldn't have been great.

Finally Wilson (a humongous racist who re segregated the government) probably wouldn't have appreciated TR recruiting African American soldiers"
15;Roosevelt wasn't wrong.  I'm from Staunton, Virginia, USA, where Wilson was born and is practically worshipped by local historians.  Left a bad taste in my mouth.
16;That’s true. Back home I weighed about 120lbs, now in the north east US I’m 160lbs. Amazing. 
17;Sounds like a weight loss LPT. 
18;I'm not heavy or fat, i'm just really far far away from the equator!
19;People from Wisconsin aren’t just fat for no reason, it’s easier to be fat than carry sandbags in a fanny-pack so that they don’t slip while walking in the ice and snow.

22;"Saw one once, back in the 90s, while downrigger trolling off our boat. Damn thing was probably 20 feet tall from crest to trough. Luckily we were going right at it, so we ran forward and got under the roof and behind the windshield, avoiding getting swept from the boat. We plowed through it like a damn drill, and popped out the other side like a cork.

Worst damn day of fishing ever. I was so seasick I couldn't handle it after that. And we burned out the bilge pump on the way home because of all the water. But we made it, probably by sheer luck more than anything.

Edit: Aww gee, thanks for the compliments. I'm landbound now, have been for quite some time, but you are too kind. I may just narrate this over some B-Roll and toss it on Youtube, just for shits and giggles. "

Children's ice cream!...You know when fluoridation began?...1946. 1946, Mandrake. How does that coincide with your post-war Commie conspiracy, huh? It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any choice. That's the way your hard-core Commie works. I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love...Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I-I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Mandrake...but I do deny them my essence.

53;"I have a friend who writes Ts&amp;Cs and contracts for tech companies. He started noticing smaller companies would just copy Ts&amp;Cs from other larger companies so about a decade ago in one of the ones he made for quite a large and successful tech company he put in some pretty unusual language. Now every time he buys a consumer electronic product he goes to that section to see if the weird language is in there. He says it’s shocking how many of them have it."
54;you wouldn t agree if you read them. but if you don t agree, you can t do anything
55;I think if companies want to enforce them they should be required to keep them on screen for the length of time the average person takes to read them. oh you want to use Facebook? Sorry can't use your computer for the next 5 hours. Would be cut down to a paragraph in a week
56;As long as I'm getting paid.
57;Something has to be done about the exponentially increasing amount of leagalese needed to preform in today's world, and the ability for corrupt people to hide behind it. 
58;You heavily overestimate the speed at which I can read...
59;Not if you speed read through. Most of the bullet points you can grasp in a glance. Just a few of them becomes a bit tricky. Most of it is common to all of them. Still don't really read them though. 
60;And reading them does zip to protect your privacy. 
61;"Sorry boss, gotta spend the next 76 business days reading these T&amp;C's, so I can't finish those reports for you."
62;We need a non-profit that reads all the privacy policies, breaks them down, and scores them.
63;I read where one such license/use agreement included signing over your first-born child. Real license, but done just for the lulz. 
64;So if you can't read them, don't agree to them.
65;Which is why they are worthless and pretty much never hold up in court. Companies and websites use them as a liability umbrella so they can avoid getting sued for something that idiot users do, not to create any kind of binding contract that allows the company/website owners to get away with anything they like.
66;Only 76?

Unfortunately this is a pipe dream and of course people are going to say impossible and I'm looking at major downvotes here as well as my comment probably getting buried. But hey what if it we're possible."
70;"You misspelled ""click through"". I don't agree to anything; I click necessary buttons to access content. It would be pretty impossible to even argue that anyone could agree to something which they didn't read, much less understand."
71;What if I read it strictly on the weekends? 
72;I don’t read that shit
73;this is the part where a bot scans the files and give you TLDR of your privacy policies scores it and marks out the red flags 
74;Like you could possibly even know that
75;That's still doable. Tbh, I was expecting a few years and that would have freaked me out...
76;If I remember correctly when this first came out, it was looking at the policy for every page you visit on the internet, not just the ones that you click an agreement to. That's why the excessive length of time. 
77;Good that someone calculated this and wrote in down.
78;Is there a website out there where there's a TLDR version for each site? Seems like it might be a good venture.

81;I don't agree to any of them.
82;Thank you. This helps me understand why we have a government and why they should protect us enough, that we don't have to worry about reading through them all.
83;There should be a law that throws out any rights a company has and opens them up to lawsuits and litigation if their ToS takes more than 5 minutes for an average person to read and they can't understand it.

Well this fridge came in a giant box with probably a full inch thick cardboard (details below).  Well, we figured out we could climb inside and both use it like a tank track(much cooler than a hamster wheel)  So we took off rolling this thing right out into the woods, right through everything, breaking stick, down into ditches, over fallen trees, and right through full on blackberry hedges.  

We left it outside and it rained.. and there went our amazing toy :( "

180;"I was stationed on the battleship USS Missouri during Desert Storm, my battle station was in Turret 2. One afternoon at watch change, I climbed down the hatch and outside the turret. As soon as I got outside, the smell of oil hit my nostrils. I joined the smallish crowd walking over to the Port side railings and looked over the side. 
The water was a mutli-hued shade of brown. It was an oil spill, as far as the eye could see. It seemed to be fighting the sea water for space on the surface, and the water and oil swirled and churned around and over onto themselves, like the lava lamps I remembered from my youth. 
I'll never forget the smell, like the oldest dirtiest part of your grandpa's old garage, the dark, oily part that hadn't seen a mop since he was a boy. We all stared at the slick for a while, straining to see then end of it. We never did.

It was sometime later we all learned it was intentional, Hussein causing the largest oil spill in history, what became known as the Gulf War oil Spill, and we drove right through it."

You see a new or evolving mole and know it's trouble. But you see a weird spot on your nail and think ""Oh, must have banged it."" Everyone should go online and look at photos of these cancers so they can be aware of the danger signs. And ladies, don't wear polish on your fingers or toes when getting a check up. Your nails can offer clues to a variety of health issues."

384;"Bahamas here. I live in a house with a Bermuda roof and a 40,000 gallon cistern. A couple of things:

The Bahamas and Bermuda are porous aeolian limestone. This means standing fresh water is rare or absent. It seeps into the limestone. 

Surrounded by denser, saltier, ocean water, this seeps in too. The less dense rainwater floats on the seawater underground as a freshwater lens. This is both nations’ groundwater supply. Bermuda [has fresh water](http://www.bermuda-online.org/architecture.htm)."
385;Interesting. Do the residents have to pay any form of water bills, though?
386;"I don’t know if it’s been mentioned, but it’s very common for people in Hawaii to use catchment water (essentially the same thing.) People who live in the more populated areas often get county water, but I would say at least here on the Big Island, catchment is more common. 

Edit: Also, there are no water bills for those of us living off of catchment, and we do buy drinking water, mostly in the forms of the stereotypical office water cooler, 5-gallon jug type. Refillable, of course. "
387;"Most of the Caribbean islands operate the same way.  I live on St. Croix in the USVI, and while there is some ""city water"" from a desalination plant, Most people get water by collecting rain on the roof into a cistern.  From there some people filter it, others drink it straight."

It is not very safe, it is the number 1 cause of liver injuries, and taking it with alcohol can be dangerous. Simply taking it at its maximum dose continuously for a period of time is dangerous enough to the liver.

531;"&gt;The surviving Tyrians fell back to the Agenorium, an old fortress in the northern sector of the city, but only managed to hold out for a brief period before they were slaughtered. The besiegers blood was up, and, after a long and bitter siege, they were not inclined to be merciful. For months they had endured grinding labour, been tormented by artillery and archery, and witnessed the slaughter of their captured comrades on the city walls. Six thousand Tyrians were slaughtered when the city was taken, and another 2,000 crucified on the beach. A further 30,000 were sold into slavery. Amongst those spared were the King and his family, and a number of Carthaginian pilgrims who took sanctuary in the Temple of Melqart. Macedonian losses amounted to 400 slain."
532;"Another fun fact: Alexander's army had been with him for 8 years in campaign. 8 years without being able to spend your money back at home, without seeing your wife and kids, without doing anything else but killing foreigners, marching, eating shitty food and seeing your friends die 1 by 1 for almost a decade.

The army stopped and refused to march forward. Alexander buckled and decided to go back home. He split the army in half and sent one half through sea and marched with the other.

However, he marched them through the desert for 2 months. The march killed 1/3 of the army, around 12,000. The army that had been with him since the beginning and basically gave themselves to him and that's how he rewarded them.

Now you know why he was poisoned and killed shortly after."

They started out with the name New Tyre, in honor of their origins, but they eventually moved to the name we know them by now: [Canadian Tire.](http://www.canadiantire.ca/)"

It seems excessively violent now, but this was standard operating procedure back then, because if you did not take such drastic measures and leave  your enemy in a state he could recover from, he'd just slaughter your family and friends the second he could."

563;"Someone mentioned the At the End of the World book. In it, the journalist who traveled with U2 said that their manager got it across to Adam that it was arguable that Bono was 62.5% of the band, as chief lyricist and at least 25% of the songwriting team. All profits had been historically split evenly, but if Adam wasn't going to contribute fully, was going to miss shows, and wander in and out of writing/recording sessions, maybe the pay structure should change.

I suspect that was a big part of what got his attention, along with the embarrassment.

Oh, and the reason that U2 would go on stage with a bass tech was that they had sold out the Sydney football stadium and not only would the refunds be a nightmare, but the camera crew needed a rehearsal night to shoot the DVD pictured in this post."

The containers were stored neatly in racks...

&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals.

685;Conclusion: That beach needs a lifeguard
686;That 4 year olds name? Albert Eistein
687;"This one comes up a lot. I recall it was listed in The Book of Lists which I read in the early 1980s. A while back I researched this story along with some of the others listed along with it in that book (and in many other similar books and now, websites). 

These stories included the two guys in Bermuda killed by the same taxicab on the same street exactly one year apart. Joseph Figlock who is said to have caught the same baby falling from a high window on two different occasions. The twin boys raised separately but who grew up with many uncanny similarities. And this story: Alice Blaise rescuing Roger Lausier, a little boy who grew up to save her husband from drowning years later.

Well the **twin boys raised apart [were real](http://www.limaohio.com/features/lifestyle/147776/reunited-after-39-years)**. Probably some of the coincidences were exaggerated in some retellings, but the essential facts were well documented.

The **falling babies story is part true, part exaggeration**. Joseph Figlock was apparently [twice hit by babies](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/36104/did-joseph-figlock-catch-the-same-baby-falling-from-the-same-window-twice?utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=google_rich_qa&amp;utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) but they were different babies. Some retellings specifiy that neither Figlock or any of the babies were harmed. Actually all were injured in each case.

The **brothers killed in Bermuda by the same taxicab is difficult to verify**, but it was [reported in a few brief news articles at the time](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20498/were-two-brothers-killed-on-the-same-moped-by-the-same-taxi-driver-exactly-a-ye?utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=google_rich_qa&amp;utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) so who knows?

But, much googling failed to turn up anything new about Alice Blaise and Roger Lausier. It makes me think this story is apocryphal. I mean, it is relatively recent and the story has all parties surviving, so where are they now? Why hasn't some news media publisher tracked any of them down for an interview? Where is their social media presence?"

I’m reminded of my trip to the Titan Missile Museum, an actual decommissioned missile site, where only a fence kept you from accessing the ground over the silo, but multiple large and heavy interlocked doors still stood between you and the missile and control center.

Churchill was having doubts so he talked directly to the British people to get their mood toward surrender and appeasement - unanimously the people said ""Fuck Hitler"" and wanted to fight. 

His resolve buoyed by the people he gave a great speech in Parliament which shut down the conspirators who were trying to have him removed from power behind the scenes for driving the country toward war.

His results showed that this simply wasn't true. The crows do in fact drop the nuts on the road (as it is large hard surface), but they are not using the cars to crack the nuts. Instead, the cars make an environment that makes it harder for other birds to swoop in and steal their food. Normally, the birds fly up just barely high enough to get a crack in the nut, but not too high or else while they fly down to get the nut another crow may steal their food. So they drop in an area with a semi-predictable amount of danger that changes from time to time, simply to reduce the chances of having their food stolen before they can get to it.

If I had a link to his paper I would link it, but I'm too lazy. But keep in mind,  I'm just passing on his results, not stating my own opinion."

Knowing what I know about crows I am probably on a crow hit list somewhere.

1389;I may be in the minority, but I thought it had its moments. Justin Timberlake is great in it
1390;[deleted]
1391;I loved this movie. Nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure. 
1392;... and then come back incognito on the gong show. 
1393;I love this movie lmao
1394;TABERNAC!!!!
1395;Yet Adam Sandler still gets roles.
1396;Actually he was in Inglourious Basterds
1397;I raise you one Quebec pizza!
1398;10 years isn't that long when you are a fucking awful person to work with, eh Mike?
1399;I was at a hockey game where they had a guy shooting a T-shirt cannon. I got a Love Guru shirt. Fell apart about the second time in the wash.
1400;Poor Ben Kinsley, that's who I REALLY felt sorry for in that abomination.
1401;Why did you post this twice in less than 24 hours??
1402;"He will be ok!     http://wisetoast.com/mike-myers-net-worth/ 
    "
1403;Um, he's on the gong show now. Still a legend.
1404;Just make another austin powers please
1405;I think it’s really sad how one bad movie can kill your career. It’s the agent’s fault for recommending it, not his. 
1406;I don't know how true it is but I heard Myers is desperate for approval I'm not surprised that movie set him back a bit. 
1407;Mariska Hargitay
1408;Dude, you couldn't pay me to watch that movie.
1409;Hopefully he'll have a rebound after Shrek 5
1410;Didn't you post this last night?
1411;break the pickle, tickle tickle
1412;What about inglorious basterds?
1413;"I watched land of the lost the other day. I was alternatively staring wide eyed and screaming who approved this? And even that wasn't a career killing movie for Will Ferrell. There will always be ""worst films"". These help tapping audiences. They might find some undiscovered niche and make a killing with whatever random bullshit they cook up."
1414;Well, apparently not career killing b/c another austin powers movie is coming...
1415;Teflon Timberlake was the only one to escape unscathed. And the sprinkler dance.
1416;I remember going to see this at the movies, I actually fell asleep. Sorry to the friend who'd bought my ticket as a birthday present. 
1417;Shouldve never fucking cucked us with the next Austin Powers. 
1418;"It’s because he still wants to do this pg-13 shit

It’s really hard to be funny without being offensive these days"
1419;[deleted]
1420;He was in Inglorious Bastards after that. 
1421;No, that's incorrect as Myers was in the film Inglorious Bastards 2009. 
1422;Most of the camels there now are pretty wild about being stuck there.
1423;There were wild camels in North America 100 years ago too. 
1424;There are still camels in Texas
1425;It’s just called rubbish. All of it is rubbish. 
1426;I eat trash because I am trash
1427;"I am both garbage &amp; trash "
1428;That's all rubbish
1429;That answers the burning question I never asked.  Fun to know though!
1430;What about white trash? What room does that come from?
1431;So trash talk comes from the bedroom?
1432;What a load of rubbish.
1433;Dumbest shit ever \- someone just made that shit up and you bought it. Congrats
1434;"So people you label as trash are not human pieces of shit? That makes no sense.
