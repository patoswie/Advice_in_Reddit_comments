39;"I‚Äôm curious about the details here. I have some questions. 

Who is taking care of the dog when the kid is induced with anesthesia? (Most places do not allow parents to go past the semi restricted area of the hospital OR regardless, which leads me to believe the dog wasn‚Äôt allowed either.)

All hair is supposed to be covered in the restricted area of the department, and rooms with open sterile supplies require face masks to prevent contamination via breathing. This dog has exposed hair and is breathing openly. 

Why is a therapy dog to reduce anxiety better than giving the kid some Versed (a benzodiazepine) like nearly every pediatric surgery patient I‚Äôve ever had?

My theory is that the therapy dog was dressed up like operating room staff to help ease a child‚Äôs mind during the preoperative period, not actually accompanying them to the OR. 

I‚Äôm an OR nurse, I love dogs, I think therapy animals are amazing; but you aren‚Äôt bringing an animal into my OR. We keep a tight lid on everything back there from the temperature and humidity level of the room, to blocking off main doorways and only allowing entrance through the side door, to bitching at staff about walking around the room because they are causing too much airflow. A dog does not fit in with us unfortunately. "
40;Are these available through the hospital for grown men?

125;Looks like they unwrapped a mummified dog in the first picture 
126;Amazing. I do hope however they make the rotten person who caused this to go through the same suffering.
127;"Sometimes you can't kill a strong will.

That is the bestest boy."
128;He looked like roadkill in the first picture.  Amazing recovery indeed.
129;Omg this angers me so much. What kind of evil POS did this to that poor dog?! Thank god for the angels that helped him recover üíñ
130;If you only showed the first picture I never would have believed that animal was alive. Glad he made a full recovery. 
131;My heart is making my eyes leak a little bit
132;The fourth picture of him really has a beautiful fourshadowing.
133;There's should be a Batman episode where he creates an animal sanctuary and then beat up people commit cruelty against animals. If watch that 
134;"Ugh, I couldn‚Äôt stomach really looking at the photos. I could only hope whatever you do to innocent animals get in turn done to you. They only do what they can do to survive. We on the other hand do what we do with intent. It‚Äôs disgusting. 

Troll be brave somewhere where it‚Äôs not anonymous "
135;Damn people who do this. Good on those who helped Patrick!
136;So glad he's ok,all my dogs are rescues ,they somehow always found me , I wonder how they got muscle back on him,we've tried everything with lexie,her weight is normal but she looks terribly bony, she's got a clean bill of health from the vet,but she always looks like she's starved, she was a rescue too, had her for 4 years 
137;"Some times when I hear these stories, I end up thinking about all the animals that are trapped with sadistic owners right now and I get really cut up inside. I wish I could send out good thoughts and love to all these animals in suffering, but good thoughts don‚Äôt count for shit against the unstoppable and impending inevitable that is human cruelty .. or just mere life. 

All I or we can do is hold our animals close to us and think ‚Äúyes, maybe you‚Äôre a bit fat but it‚Äôs because I fucking love you‚Äù. (To my Labrador sitting like an anchor on my tiny bed)"
138;Why not be an asshole who drives somewhere and dumps the dog in someone else's neighborhood or tries him up to the SPCA door so they find him in the morning? Why you gotta abuse the dog then stuff him in a garbage bag while still alive?!?!? ...... this is so infuriating. 
139;Jesus christ. That poor animal. Well done to all those who nursed him back.
140;More on the story including a video of him after getting better: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2406061/Kisha-Curtis-New-Jersey-woman-sentenced-18-months-parole-throwing-pit-bull-dog-trash.html
141;Here‚Äôs hoping karma finds that pups previous ‚Äúowner‚Äù in the worst way
142;"I remember hearing about this when it first happened, they named him Patrick because they found him either on or within a day or 2 of St. Patrick's day. Also, the piece of human garbage that did this to him tried to say it was because she didn't have enough money to feed him üò† but she wasn't starving (I'd feed my dog before I'd feed myself if it came down to it) &amp; had her hair &amp; nails done, which costs money. Money that she could have used to buy, oh I don't know, maybe a fucking bag of kibbles n bits. Plus, how the fuck long do you have to be starving a dog, especially a bulkier breed like a pit bull, to have it get down to nothing but skin &amp; bones? Also, if you can't afford to feed your dog, why is the acceptable solution to put him in a trash bag &amp; tie it up, while he's still fucking breathing, &amp; throw it down a multiple story garbage chute? I mean calling a friend or family member &amp; saying ""hey, can you take my dog for a little while so I can try to get my shit together?"" never occurred to her? No, because she didn't really care. A REAL dog person would have done everything in their power to prevent this kind of thing from happening."
143;Was there any permanent damage from malnutrition?
144;That's insane
145;People do not deserve to be alive who can treat animals like that. Absolutely horrific. I fucking HATE people. But! To those who helped get him through and to all vets and animal rescue workers, thank you. Thank you for pushing on through the vile things you come across and thank you for making those beautiful creatures better. You are wonderful. 
146;Patrick the perseverer. 
147;Amazing transformation. Hopefully he gets the life he deserves. 
148;I like the #goals pic they put up for him in the fourth picture.

&gt;[doctors told him they usually don't accept donors over the age of 60. But since he was in such good physical condition, it was possible.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/health/man-helps-high-school-alumni-get-kidney-trnd/index.html)

683;"Sometimes, the little things like this are all I need to restore my faith in humanity, and to be truly amazed by the beauty of true altruistic love.

692;To everyone thinking how awesome the donor is, consider signing up for the [National Bone Marrow Registry](https://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/donate-bone-marrow/join-the-marrow-registry/). All it takes is a quick cheek swab, after which they put you in the registry. Going forward, if you end up as a match for someone who needs it, they'll just give you some drugs for 5 days and then you go through an apharesis procedure where they collect your blood stem cells. I donated last January, if anyone is interested but has questions.
693;"Is this in r/upliftingnews?

Events like this keep the candle burning that there is a little hope for humanity.  

Such a large request answered by someone he barely knew.  This man is very honorable and brave.  He could have skipped the email and went on with life with a clean conscience but he didn't.  He responded with a promise then went through all the difficulties of keeping his promise.  

Race didnt matter and it shouldn't.  Were all the same human beings underneath it all.  Same organs and systems keep us going with only a few differences on the outside.   The proof is there, the white man's kidney worked the same in the recipient body of a different color.   The biggest difference in humans is in the mind and thoughts that drive us.  Every race has great and terrible people.

This story has a lot of lessons wrapped up in one if you look hard enough.  Compassion and selflessness just scratch the surface.  I hope their stories change the world for the good if even by the smallest amounts every bit helps.

Congratulations to these two and may they live long happy lives from here.

761;"I'm a veterinarian. This dog possibly has myotonia congenita. This is a genetic disorder characterized by skeletal muscle hypertrophy (increase muscle tissue) and increased muscle tone. His ears are cropped because it's a common thing to do with pit bull breeds. A sign that this dog is not a fighter is that he likely has myotonia congenita (his muscles are stiff and wouldn't be a decent fighter) and his tail is long. Fighting dogs have cropped ears and docked tails.

In my experience, I've been snipped at more by chihuahuas than pit bulls. Pit bull breeds tend to actually be the friendliest of dogs. Sure breeds tend to have certain personality traits, but ultimately every dog is an individual. "

The idea that they're for vampires is a commonly held superstition. They were actually created to protect loved ones, or the rich, from grave robbers who were prolific in the day.
The bodies were delivered to local doctors/schools/Frankenstein to dissect and learn from.

955;Some people did believe the dead would rise and would decapitate the corpse.  There was a documentary about this and some people in eastern european villages still exhume bodies to decapitate them or drive a stake through their heart as they were believed to be the cause of misfortunes in the village.  Apparently there was blood on the shrowd roughly where the mouth was when they opened the coffin which confirmed their belief although there was a scientific explanation for it.

1001;"In my opinion, an amazing photo will be an amazing photo no matter what camera you use. Sometimes it's just about the composition, lighting, and other environmental factors, but it's not always about the camera. I took some amazing photos with a $100 Kodak digital and HP Photosmart 315 (with dead pixels galore) when I was a kid. Something I hate about DSLRs is they make every photo look pretty great with little to no effort, though in the right hands it can make an already great photo look even more amazing. Just my two cents, the topic of cameras is a pretty opinionated thing in the photography world.

But back on topic: I think this is great!"

1022;We should upgrade to wifi
1023;"These are undersea **power** cables. The large copper parts transmit power and the much much smaller fibres are for telecommunications. 

Telecommunications cables are normally quite small in diameter - about the size of a garden hose, because they need to be loaded onto a ship in one go and unloaded all the way to their destination. If they were as big as the ones in the picture there would be no way they'd fit on the ship for the trans continental distances.

The large diameter cooper cables are used to transmit power from things like offshore wind farms, across to islands or to oil rigs/wells. The one in the top right with the empty space is used for hydraulics, for things like opening and closing oil pipeline valves remotely."

1031;"Pic on the left is most likely high voltage (kilo-volts) 3 phase AC. The bundles of small copper in each of the 3 big copper blocks are that way most likely because of the skin effect. Probably the small dot on the left is ground. 

To be honest, i wonder if this is even really underwater cabling; instead underground cables. Maybe as someone else said it's for power from offshore wind farms. 

By no means am I an expert, but my understanding was fiber optic was used for trans-ocean cabling. "
