tl;dr wife makes me feel like sex is a chore. And I should be content with getting a release and not ask or try for anything more. ";36;"Yay, Obligation sex.  Good stuff, isn't it?  

Hard truth (and I speak from personal experience here) - your whining and acting butt-hurt when you get turned down is super un-attractive, and making someone who isn't all that interested in sex with you even less appealing, and much more similar to washing dishes than the passionate sex from 5+ years ago. Not to mention, it sounds like all the 'helping out' you do is strictly an exchange for her affection (sex), and not because doing that work is shit that you should actually be doing anyway. If I got that from your post, i'm 100% sure she feels the same way. 

My advice - and take this with a grain of salt, as i'm still working my way out of the exact same situation you're in - stop focusing about sex.  Honestly, drop it all together until you can handle the rejection without getting sad or angry or frustrated.  Stop initiating, stop with the innuendo, stop doing shit specifically as an exchange for sex, stop all of it.  Focus on finding a way to occupy your day in a way that makes you more happy, secure, fulfilled and consumed so that you stop focusing on this.  Go to the gym more (taking out my frustration on weights and a heavy bag have been a LIFE changer for me), pick up a certification or educational class, get a new hobby - whatever.  Get out and do something fun.  

Once the negative association you both have with sex wears off (her being constantly badgered and you acting like a bitch when you get denied), and you're happy with your new hobbies and schedule, the sex comes back naturally, and believe me, it's much better. 

You can't demand attraction.  Sex is 100% about attraction.  She's not attracted to you right now, otherwise she'd be interested in sleeping with you.  The only way I see to build that attraction back is to improve yourself and make yourself more attractive to her.  The first step is to remove all the shit that is currently making you unattractive.";37;1.0277777777777777;[[0.9735428]];[[0.65197089]];0.9257;0.14800000000000002;0.765;0.086;-0.638;0.145;0.693;0.162;0.07900000000000001;0.08043478260869566;0.13912262506012504;-0.05868784245142938

";36;"Base upon personal experience, work in making yourself into a great package and person. Get in shape if you’re not. Help around the house. Dress well. Stop asking for sex. Fix the car. Take care of the kids. 

Sex is secondary for a lot of women, unless their man is highly desirable to them. Being in shape, dressing a little nicer, and taking care of things that need to be taken care of will all make you more desirable. 

And women hate desperation. So try to be without desire.  If she comes to you for sex, go for it and make her day. If not, be cool with it. But don’t ask for it. Let her offer.

Go watch the movie “The Tao of Steve”... it puts it all into three sentences —

Be without desire. 
Be excellent before them.

Especially if I have somewhere to be, am stressed from work, or am already emotionally exhausted from being with friends or family all night long. 

That's my perspective as an introvert. Sex is *draaaaining*. To put pressure on myself to then enjoy it and finish and make sure you are enjoying it too would make me back away and get angry, which it sounds like she is doing.

Today I said something about doing something in the morning. The reply I got was “we just did it last night, why was that not good enough. Like a couple of days in between would be reasonable.i don’t know why you want to when you got what you needed last night.”
In my head I’m just thinking. Sorry I love my wife and think she’s beautiful and want to be intimate with her. 
I’m tired of feeling like a bad person about this.
Looking for advice on how to talk more or what to do about the situation?

tl;dr wife makes me feel like sex is a chore. And I should be content with getting a release and not ask or try for anything more. ";36;"So my therapist talked about this in our last session. Your wife is viewing your request as another GIVE ME on her time and it sounds like she is resentful. When you have kids, especially little kids your day is filled with mom, mom, mom, mom, mom non stop. Add to that the list of all the crap she has to do and it can feel like your entire life is being sucked up by small humans.

Therapist said when you have kids your sex life dips hard, and then the older the kids get the more it comes back up. But you asking for sex, its a chore to her now. Not that she doesnt love you, but its just  another hand out for her time and attention.

Have you tried doing dates with no expectations? Do you get sitters for the kids? Do you touch her without expecting anything? If you have I would probably suggest therapy, but also realize after you have a baby it takes 7 full years for your body to recover. Her hormones may be out of wack, combine that with lack of sleep and lack of energy... well yeah, at this point you really are just another hand out for her time and attention.";2;0.05555555555555555;[[0.98003942]];[[0.58030171]];0.9257;0.14800000000000002;0.765;0.086;0.3728;0.076;0.836;0.087;0.073;0.08043478260869566;0.030769230769230774;0.04966555183946489

tl;dr wife makes me feel like sex is a chore. And I should be content with getting a release and not ask or try for anything more. ";36;"I am like this with my boyfriend. 
He wants to have sex ALLLL the time. In the morning, before work, before bed.
I get so exhausted. I would make him wait a day or 2 before we have sex because I don't feel horny as he does. I stop wanting Sex because if we do it to much I don't see it attractive any more. 
Here's my advice 
1. What you're doing as a husband is awesome keep doing it. 
2. Don't ask for it! Couple days ago my boyfriend told me he didn't want to have sex, I was shocked but also turned on. The fact that he didn't want to made me want it sooooo bad even more. So maybe try that. 
3. Give her some. Whether orally or rubbing her. My boyfriend would want sex but I wouldn't. No matter how many time I would say no no no no! In his head it was yes yes yes! And he would keep trying to seduce me and start pleasuring me. 
Good luck! ";2;0.05555555555555555;[[0.96953852]];[[0.6763737]];0.9257;0.14800000000000002;0.765;0.086;0.8822;0.157;0.6970000000000001;0.146;0.05099999999999999;0.08043478260869566;0.2778409090909091;-0.19740612648221345

tl;dr wife makes me feel like sex is a chore. And I should be content with getting a release and not ask or try for anything more. ";36;"You need to stop being her husband and be her boyfriend. As a woman myself, I can attest to the fact that if my husband did laundry, that does NOT equal sex that night. What does get me (and most of my female friends) going are the small things- being romanced. Talking and listening to me; a hand on my Lower back when he walks through the kitchen to get by. A quick kiss on my neck or cheek. A note of appreciation or notice how much I’m doing my best... all of this without the pressure of sex. Being silly, vulnerable and loving. 

Sex shouldn’t be a “if- then” scenario regarding help around the house, fixing stuff etc. 

You’ve only been in the parenting world for 3.5 years and you have another one a year after your first. That’s a lot of stress on a marriage and as individuals. 

Best solution is to go to therapy. She may be using the kids as an excuse to avoid sex, but that is what you can work through with help. 

Has she gone to a doctor? Many women’s hormones change, their actual uterus can change, causing discomfort during sex.  

I’d also read Love Languages (something like that) it asks questions that lead you to figure out how you express love and how you want it expressed as well as for your spouse! 

Good luck, hang in there. I’m impressed you want to do something about it! ";2;0.05555555555555555;[[0.97246905]];[[0.77972047]];0.9257;0.14800000000000002;0.765;0.086;0.9912;0.203;0.754;0.043;-0.09800000000000003;0.08043478260869566;0.2813492063492064;-0.20091442374051074

";36;It sounds that she does not want to talk about it as she is under impression that all you want is sex all the time which she does not want for some reasons. She should see the marriage counselor to understand the importance of the intimacy and what you are asking is a normal thing where she should support you or at least need to communicate her feelings with you but the way she is handing the matter is not reasonable. It sounds that she is making you feel guilty for asking for the sex which is not good for the married life in the long run.

tl;dr wife makes me feel like sex is a chore. And I should be content with getting a release and not ask or try for anything more. ";36;"When my kids were that age I was pretty 'touched out', and my husband didn't respect any of that at all and I ended up feeling a lot like your wife.  I felt like my husband has ZERO respect or empathy for how I was feeling and it created a lot of resentment.  Then we'd end up going a few days or even a week without sex and he'd tell me how unhappy he was ""with our sex life"" because he was baiting me to initiate, so that he could complain that I wasn't.

My final answer to him was to schedule 2 days a week that sex is definitely going to happen (unless some reason comes up, but then it's assumed to move to the next day).  The other days he can initiate (or I can) but it's understood that it's okay if the answer is no.

I think this helps him and his issues with needing sex.  My problem is that I don't feel any intimacy during the sex.  It's like he just wants to get off and I'm there for that.  He asks if I'm satisfied at the end and if I'm not, I finish up with a toy.  So, he's getting sex, but I'm not getting intimacy.

Sorry to use your post to vent a little.  My real advice is to try to schedule it in. It works for me because I know it's coming so I can spend the evening getting myself in the mood and ready.";2;0.05555555555555555;[[0.97136634]];[[0.72056192]];0.9257;0.14800000000000002;0.765;0.086;0.8815;0.11199999999999999;0.828;0.06;0.009999999999999995;0.08043478260869566;0.01696428571428571;0.06347049689440995

tl;dr wife makes me feel like sex is a chore. And I should be content with getting a release and not ask or try for anything more. ";36;"&gt;no amount of cleaning up, laundry

this is where you and lots of guys fuck up. the logic is... what exactyl? that  she sees you did the laundry and now she'll be turned on and want to fuck her maid? 

there are things that attract her and turn her on. for example if you two got divorced, you think she wouldnt have great sex with someone else? she would obviously

so whatever those things are, and theyre not that different from woman to woman, you need to figure out and do those things rather than trying to show youre a good boy who does his chores

also the constant asking for it, and even giving her so much attention and importance is a turn off. you'd be better off ignoring her more than trying to please her. you know those businesses that have good deals, but they keep harassing you via email/calls/flyers? thats what its like

Your wife sounds tired and like she lacks a libido. I get that. And as a wife who has found herself annoyed and resentful of her husband, and consequently struggled with being sexually attracted to her husband: it sounds like she could also be struggling with that.

It also sounds like there is a possibility of libido differences, wish is common and means you both meet in the middle.

Sex should be fun and women should have libidos. When we don’t we need to address why. Is it stress, hormones, relationship woes, negative emotions?

tl;dr wife makes me feel like sex is a chore. And I should be content with getting a release and not ask or try for anything more. ";36;"OP, I'm sorry you're going through this. It's hard. It sounds like you're a great dad and husband. Your wife sounds a bit selfish and it's disappointing how many ""man up"" responses you got and how many of the responders blamed you. Spouses often have different sexual desires, and it's often not about attraction at all but about desire (or lack of desire) for any sexual contact. 

Some.questions/suggestions in no particular order -

1. Is she on hormonal BC? That really jacks with sex drive.

2. How is she feeling about her body?  Pregnancy and childbirth can leave us moms feeling less than hot for a while. Is it possible that she avoids sex (or certain sexual activities) because she's not feeling great about herself?

3. What does she need to feel loved? Figure out her love language and try to speak it. Maybe read the Five Love Languages together and talk to her about what you need. 

4. If you're not already, get treatment for the depression. Depression sucks not only for the depressed person but for those around him or her. Medication, therapy, whatever. It works. 

5. What can you do for yourself every day? What can you do to socialize with more adults?  Being home with kids can be really really isolating, so getting some more support may help you feel better.

6. Couples therapy, if she's willing.

It’s more about the intimacy of giving each other pleasure is what you are missing.

tl;dr wife makes me feel like sex is a chore. And I should be content with getting a release and not ask or try for anything more. ";36;"There are two ways of looking at this.

1. is /u/ifeellikeanasshole2 's advice: your wife is feeling pressured, and it has killed her libido. Let's hope that's the case. Definitely try this approach first.

2. is that your wife is not (maybe never was) that into sex, and she's over it now. Most likely permanently. She could visit a doctor. She could visit a therapist. But depending how long it has been crap, this may be the new, unchangeable, unfixable reality.

So if (2) the case, you have to decide whether:

 * you can put up with infrequent, crap sex
 * you can arrange to get your needs taken care of elsewhere
 * you split up

It really is that simple.

What you have to accept is that the option you want:

 * frequent, good sex with wife

is not on the table right now, and may never be again.";1;0.027777777777777776;[[0.92843871]];[[0.62100447]];0.9257;0.14800000000000002;0.765;0.086;0.5423;0.106;0.823;0.07200000000000001;0.028;0.08043478260869566;0.023005565862708712;0.05742921674598695

It makes me angry to  even read it.
 I finally divorced her after years wasted.
 Women like her are fucking assholes.
They think sex is about ""busting a nut"" instead of what it really is...a man's need for passion and closeness. 

 I will prepare for downvotes...

Get a girlfriend.
If you get caught, you end up divorced, but you are heading that way anyway..

Today we’re gonna meet to have a chat about this situation. 
I want to stay with her but i’m afraid that the she doesn’t actually want to open up and know me and that all she wants is a meaningless relationship where we go out sometimes and kiss without actually knowing each other.

(17M) Desperately need advice regarding possible pregnancy.;t3_8d55m3;8;My girlfriend and I are both 17. We have been having sex roughly once a week, always using condoms. There have been 2 occasions where I had entered her without a condom, but less than 15 seconds both times and no where near climax. Her period is always irregular, almost always late. At the end of every month, she takes a pregnancy test for peace of mind. This month, she took a first response digital yesterday around 4PM which said ‘YES+’. She then went and bought 2 more sticks, both of which said negative. Later that evening she took another 2, both negative. This morning she took 2 more with her first urine, both negative. What is going on? ;1;"Sounds like a false positive. Those can happen. If she took a test with the first urine of the day and it came out negative, she’s definitely not pregnant—that’s when the pregnancy hormone is most concentrated, and when the positive result is most likely to show up (if she really were pregnant, which it sounds like she’s not).  Take a deep breath, you’re fine. 

Use this as a wake up call. Get her on birth control. Or if you cant, you should at least NEVER have unprotected sex again, even if it’s just for a few seconds. You’re playing with fire here.

What is going on? ;1;"False positives with pregnancy tests are very very rare if she isn't taking some medicine that causes her HCG level to rise.

HOWEVER, if you have a positive test, followed by negative tests, what is possible is that there was a ""chemical pregnancy"".  That is where your sperm and her egg met, however there was no implantation.  So her HCG level rose, but then once implantation didn't occur, it fell again.

My wife had a chemical pregnancy last year and when she did the analog pregnancy tests, you could see the line get darker for a few days and then gradually lighter as her HCG levels fell back to normal.  Her period (which is normally like clockwork) wound up only being delayed by a couple of days.

My wife and I have this mutual friend who is a female. When I met her I was in the military, and she was attached to my unit. Hard worker, no drama, very professional. After we got back, she was adopted into our tight circle of friends and then they all moved off one by one until it was just the three of us. I got out, but the three of us remained relatively close. She had no other friends, she’s just kind of a socially awkward person, so over time my wife and I adopted her as a kind of extension into our family. She watches our kids, we have her over for dinner and invite her to hang out frequently. She even gets in on family game nights. Nothing strange or remotely sexual has ever happened. 

About a year ago she started long-distance dating this guy. She’s a lower level officer, he is lower enlisted. It’s a big no no, but I kept my mouth shut because I’m out now. I deployed with him, and he was a pathological liar with a victim complex so I always kept my distance. I hadn’t seen him in a year or more so I figured, hell, maybe he turned his life around. She seemed really happy with the guy and we didn’t want to meddle, so we were chill about it. Signs started showing up. He was in town and we all grabbed lunch. He wanted to catch up with me at the beginning of the meal, and when she tried to chime in he told her “Men were talking”. I recoiled, and corrected it on the spot. Lunch ended abruptly and I haven’t spoken to him since. He and I aren’t on outright bad terms, just very cold toward each other. 

She’s been a very bubbly, warm hearted person as long as we’ve known her and the more time she spends with this guy the more reserved she has become. We addressed it in a minimally invasive way, she assured us everything was kosher and she was just tired from work. They were engaged shortly afterward, and she asked my wife to be a maid of honor. My wife told her yes, but made it clear that we don’t care for the guy. 

We see her less and less since then.  I run, and this last winter I invited her to run a half marathon with me. My family goes to support me every year, and it’s close to home for her. It was also kind of a last big get together for all of us because she’s moving way north to be with him after they get married. She ran, and did well but ended up getting in a minor car accident afterward. She was driving his car, which she payed off with her own money. He absolutely lost his shit via phone. It was so loud that she had to excuse herself and as far as we know he never asked if she was okay. We talked with her about it, just shy of pleading. She listened but didn’t really respond to any of our concerns. She kind of faded out after that, but assured us that she was just busy with the wedding. She’s had a lot of bridesmaids withdraw due to pregnancy, military moves, etc...  

The wedding is in 13 days. It’s probably the last time we’ll see her, and we’re kind of mourning the whole situation. We don’t want to waste the opportunity to let her know we are still here if she needs anything, but really unsure about how appropriate offering that kind of support is during a wedding.   What would you say to her if you were in our shoes?";1;"Let her go. People living in extremity usually will stray further the more you try to correct them, esoecially away from a lover - because the seeming impossibility of it all reinforces the rebellious passion in it. Id say be cold and forget. Cut her loose. Pretend like its just everyday, unremarkable stuff. No special attention. 

Eventually she will have gravitated to a more moderate way of life on her own, will have left him, or will come to you seeking help years down the road.

Lunch ended abruptly and I haven’t spoken to him since. He and I aren’t on outright bad terms, just very cold toward each other. 

She’s been a very bubbly, warm hearted person as long as we’ve known her and the more time she spends with this guy the more reserved she has become. We addressed it in a minimally invasive way, she assured us everything was kosher and she was just tired from work. They were engaged shortly afterward, and she asked my wife to be a maid of honor. My wife told her yes, but made it clear that we don’t care for the guy. 

We see her less and less since then.  I run, and this last winter I invited her to run a half marathon with me. My family goes to support me every year, and it’s close to home for her. It was also kind of a last big get together for all of us because she’s moving way north to be with him after they get married. She ran, and did well but ended up getting in a minor car accident afterward. She was driving his car, which she payed off with her own money. He absolutely lost his shit via phone. It was so loud that she had to excuse herself and as far as we know he never asked if she was okay. We talked with her about it, just shy of pleading. She listened but didn’t really respond to any of our concerns. She kind of faded out after that, but assured us that she was just busy with the wedding. She’s had a lot of bridesmaids withdraw due to pregnancy, military moves, etc...  

The wedding is in 13 days. It’s probably the last time we’ll see her, and we’re kind of mourning the whole situation. We don’t want to waste the opportunity to let her know we are still here if she needs anything, but really unsure about how appropriate offering that kind of support is during a wedding.   What would you say to her if you were in our shoes?";1;"Beep boop, I'm [a bot](https://github.com/mlda065/paragraphiser_bot_aws/tree/paragraphiser).

Mutual breakup over incompatibility;t3_8cocch;3;"We were in a relationship for over a year. We both genuinely care and love each other but we mutually broke up due to our incompatibility in love languages.

I'm going thru different wave of emotions. Yesterday was the first day of NC. I thought long yesterday and concluded that I would remain NC because I know it would be better for him. I know if I told him how sad I was or how much I miss  him, he would respond and make sure I am ok. I told myself to learn to let go so that he can find someone who can give him the love language he needs.

I couldn't sleep at all last night, jolting up every time I started to drift off, and this anxiousness would take over. I kept looking over at my phone, hoping for a text or call that I knew would very unlikely come. And now this morning, I'm worried with the thought that as soon as he finds someone new, I will have lost him forever. And this is making me want to reach out.

Help. Can anyone relate? What should I do? Sometimes I feel like it's for the better for us to end like this and sometimes I just want to keep trying (which would go against the NC).


Edit: While it was a mutual breakup, we ended up in a fight over something stupid during the last time we saw each other. I wrote up an email telling him all the wonderful things I thought about our relationship and him so that we wouldn't end on a sour note.

People come and go in your life, and it's better to end it when the two of you are not compatible. It's better to love the other more than you have ever loved them, so that you could be happy that they might find something else that makes them happy.

I know you’re going through a hard time, high anxiety with self doubt and loathing about the whole situation but seriously take a step back to not think of anything and take a deep breath. Exhale all this pent up worry and fear you’re holding in. 

I know at this point in time you’re struggling and this will happen for a few weeks. What I want you to do is continue the no contact and stay courageous with the decision. Start focusing on you and only you. Do things you’ve put off or buried and make you feel good about being alone with yourself.

";12;I have a question, this place is very busy looking so if anyone answers I would be extremely grateful. I’ve been seeing this guy for about 6 months, he has his own issues and so do I. Meaning I know no one is perfect and we are still getting to know and understand each other’s boundaries within a relationship. The issue for me is, he’s more into curvy women and I’m not built that way. I’m in no way ashamed or feel insecure about my body, but my good friend does have a VERY curvy body. She’s a lovely woman who was friends with him first. I have no doubt in my mind about their friendship, but they do hug each other. They have been doing this since before I knew he existed. I’ve told him I don’t like it but he says that’s his friend. I have not brought it up with my friend because I don’t want her to feel bad about something that I know she feels is innocent. Yesterday she stopped by ( we all work together. Before you say anything I already know how dangerous this can be, dating someone I work with is very new to me) to say “hi” and he asked for a hug. They gave each other a BIG hug right in front of me. Did I say no one at work know’s we’re dating, don’t want that attention. I was hurt and angry. I haven’t said anything to him and I know I have two choices but I’m worried how this will go. He’s quick to dismiss my thoughts because he doesn’t agree. It’s weighing on my mind all night.  Honestly after typing all this out I have no clue what I want to ask. I just know I’m confused and feel lost.

";12;"The never met 3 years long distance relationship

Had a long distance relationship about 9800 miles away. Haven’t met yet. We were supposed to meet 3 times, as my country is the home country she wanted to visit. Sexting was fire. We had a very exciting love and sexual relationship. We didn’t meet. I ended up sexting some girls. Gave her my account details - and she logged in found some shitty sexts that I didn’t even remember I had written. Long story short I repented and cried, such is a thing called love. (I still love her). I met friends in between who were girls and she thought that they will take her place. (Which in any dimension of the universe will never be true). I hoped it would work out because I wanted to be her hubby for life knowing that I could bear her temperate tantrums and gas-lighting behaviour. I had been blocked for days and at many times she wouldn’t take my calls. Her most violent reactions would be when I would send gifts to her place. Which is something I could never understand?! My confidence has fallen and so have my spirits. She has now chosen to keep her social media discreet. I have felt abused when she would deny me love, over small things. While whole heartedly, I let her in. Then I just stopped caring when I was least appreciates. Then she would come and give me all the love. Suddenly, I became her priority. The last time I spoke with her was, when her mother called and told her about the split between the mother and the father. She said I can’t keep you hanging and asked me to leave her. Having felt that - it’s a serious issue, I chose to do as she bid. (Being dumped 10th time by now). I was too affected. Being suddenly let go of. We have been wrangling back and forth on Instagram messages. I can’t access her profile and I’m blocked from calling or texting her anywhere else. 

I still love her and I hope that it works out because I want to marry her. But it doesn’t seem likely.

";12;This weekend I (26F) am going on a road trip with my partner (31M) of about a year. Part of this road trip is going to a family event and I have met his family a couple of times and this didn't bother me. HOWEVER, the event is 8 hours away and I just found out that his mom is coming with us in the car. 16 hours of being stuck in a car with his mom. She is a very protective mother and I imagine is secretly (or not so secretly) judging me at all times. I'll be in the back seat, my boyfriend is not very chatty, and reading in the car makes me feel sick. PLEASE help me come up with ideas of things to do so that it's not just his mother questioning me for 16 hours. ;1;0.08333333333333334;[[0.95530882]];[[0.44701591]];0.9577;0.177;0.823;0.0;0.2661;0.055999999999999994;0.8959999999999999;0.048;0.16899999999999998;0.18760822510822509;-0.08285714285714285;0.2704653679653679

";12;"Ok pretty much I am a just a guy with a few issues,My main one being that i really like this girl but i dont know if she likes me back, I asked her once could you see us being together she was like no your too much of a mate. That really fucking broke my heart lowkey. I talk to her everyday,On snapchat and at skl. We are really close but im just worried about other men in her life that i know are better looking than me which she is friends with. We have gotten closer recently but now i just need help with pulling the trigger and securing her as my girlfriend. Currently we are just really close friends but i want it to be something more as in my eyes she is perfect,I have never felt like this for a person before (in this type of love way i have been through previous relationships) And to be honest i cant picture myself moving on from her or finding someone better or as good. I dont like her for looks I like her for her ethics,care,love,feelings,thoughts all of that stuff not her looks. Can someone please just give me some advice on how to get this wonderful girl and what i should do next.

Comfort toys in bed?;t3_8cgt2l;5;"Tl;dr my boyfriend brings a stuffed bear to bed every night including when I am staying over, can I ask for this to not happen when I’m there or should I just get the fuck over it 

My boyfriend (21m) of two years brings his childhood teddy bear in bed with him every night. He doesn’t bring it to my (21f) house or anything, but whenever I’m in bed at his place he has to either look for it or find it. It never used to irk me, and it doesn’t really even BOTHER me now, as in I don’t think it’s a massive problem that he does it. It just sort of gets under my skin a bit suddenly. 

One time I got a bit annoyed about this and he said “I thought you liked him” and then I got REALLY annoyed because it’s not a living sentient being with feelings I can hurt. But my boyfriend is so then I felt terrible. 

He’s able to sleep without it, but I don’t really like a third guest in bed every night I’m there. I don’t know if he plans on sleeping with the bear every night forever and if so I don’t know how to feel about it. 

I know it doesn’t hurt anyone. I still own my childhood toy and I have a stuffed opossum that he gave me that I keep around my bed in case I want to hug it for a bit. I know my choice to not insist on sleeping with one is personal and not a choice he needs to make with his bear. 

Still, is there any merit to me feeling weird about this bonus bedfellow? Is it worth it to say anything more than I already have? Please be nice because I’m not trying to be an asshole about this, I actually feel awful for caring

";8;"F(18) here. I was the one in my old relationship where I took the toy with me to bed every night, even at his house. I had a couple I’d switch off from. I don’t really know why other than the fact that I hate sleeping alone and basically slept in the same bed as my mom until I was a junior in high-school. 

I did end up getting over taking the plush toy to bed. 

Maybe there are some underlying things with the toy that he hasn’t mentioned? Whether he got it from a family member who has passed or aided him in childhood trauma? 

I guess if it irks you that much you could say something, but remember to be somewhat gentle about how you tell him because it could easily hit him hard if there is an underlying thing behind it. 
In my opinion I’d say as long as he isn’t doing something weird with it, you should be chillin’ with it.";1;0.125;[[0.94503849]];[[0.64515599]];-0.4373;0.107;0.7829999999999999;0.11;0.1206;0.04;0.9;0.06;0.016999999999999994;-0.010526315789473694;-0.0861111111111111;0.07558479532163741
My ex who cheated on me 2 years ago wants to get back together, not sure if I should keep moving forward;t3_8cl155;47;"Okay please do not bash me over this. I’m 26, (about to be 27) my ex girlfriend Karina is 28. We were together from when I was 18 to when I was 25. Damn, nearly 7 years. The way she cheated was, I think probabky the most common way? She went out with her girlfriends to Vegas and she got drunk and peer pressured into it and she told me stopped in the beginning of when they started having sex. She called me crying and she drive back home immediately. She was crying when she got here and told me everything. She told me I could choose what would happen with the relationship and she said she would especially love it if I would let her fix it for us. I couldn’t do it but she still went to therapy.

She always tried to contact me after we broke up and she would always send little messages like “miss you, I’m very sorry and I knwo I’m shitty for what happened and I will be waiting for you and only you, I hooe this can work out and I still love you”. Then she would ask how I was and she always asked if I needed anything. I felt depressed but I just started working out and talked with a Life Coach (she’s amazing) and she helped me get myself sorted out and off of alcohol and weed. Time passed, I tried to look for a good woman but could never find one as good as Karina. They all seem too immature or not “girlfriend material” mostly just “fuck buddies” and those type of crazy girls.

I went to a small restaraunt in town, where I met Karina and had some good memories, then I went and stopped by at the plaza where we always went to hang out and where we first kissed. They were some good memories and something extremelly unexpected happened. I saw Karina there just sitting on of the beches by the fountain. I got really nervous and I just stayed where I was and she looked around and saw me. I can’t forget her face, she looked really happy and her face turned red and I saw some tears. She approached me and we just looked at each other for a few seconds until we hugged for a few minutes. She told me she has been dying to see me, she cried again and said she was grateful that I was at least talking to her.

We went out to eat, she was nice, a good woman still but she seemed to get everything together. She asked me to come back to her place because she got a lease on a new home (it was pretty nice and I’m proud of her) and we hung out at her place, and she asked me to spend the night. She told me I could sleep wherever and I slept in the guest room, then we kind of just started hanging out again. We talked about the cheating, she said she should have never put me through that and said she understands she won’t ever even put herself in the situation where it could possibly happen again. 

I also noticed she doesn’t hang out with her friends anymore, only her family. She re- introduced me to her family and they were all happy to see me again. She talked with me again, she told me she was ready whenever I wanted to have a relationship again. We didn’t have sex until after a while (it was the best), she told me she didn’t want to make a move because she said sex would onky complicate things. I don’t know if I should move forward?

TL:DR yeah, we found each other again and she asked for another chance but not sure if I should move forward?

";57;"Usually I would say no, don’t get back with someone who cheated on you in the first place but I feel like this situation is different.

";57;"On the plus side, she came clean and has distanced herself from bad companions. Also, you are wise to reconnect slowly. Decide what you need from her to regain your trust and do so slowly. Learn what her head space was like when she cheated and how she has worked on herself to avoid future reoccurrences. 

You might be dealing with the exception that proves the rule.

She told me I could choose what would happen with the relationship and she said she would especially love it if I would let her fix it for us. I couldn’t do it but she still went to therapy.

She always tried to contact me after we broke up and she would always send little messages like “miss you, I’m very sorry and I knwo I’m shitty for what happened and I will be waiting for you and only you, I hooe this can work out and I still love you”. Then she would ask how I was and she always asked if I needed anything. I felt depressed but I just started working out and talked with a Life Coach (she’s amazing) and she helped me get myself sorted out and off of alcohol and weed. Time passed, I tried to look for a good woman but could never find one as good as Karina. They all seem too immature or not “girlfriend material” mostly just “fuck buddies” and those type of crazy girls.

I went to a small restaraunt in town, where I met Karina and had some good memories, then I went and stopped by at the plaza where we always went to hang out and where we first kissed. They were some good memories and something extremelly unexpected happened. I saw Karina there just sitting on of the beches by the fountain. I got really nervous and I just stayed where I was and she looked around and saw me. I can’t forget her face, she looked really happy and her face turned red and I saw some tears. She approached me and we just looked at each other for a few seconds until we hugged for a few minutes. She told me she has been dying to see me, she cried again and said she was grateful that I was at least talking to her.

We went out to eat, she was nice, a good woman still but she seemed to get everything together. She asked me to come back to her place because she got a lease on a new home (it was pretty nice and I’m proud of her) and we hung out at her place, and she asked me to spend the night. She told me I could sleep wherever and I slept in the guest room, then we kind of just started hanging out again. We talked about the cheating, she said she should have never put me through that and said she understands she won’t ever even put herself in the situation where it could possibly happen again. 

I also noticed she doesn’t hang out with her friends anymore, only her family. She re- introduced me to her family and they were all happy to see me again. She talked with me again, she told me she was ready whenever I wanted to have a relationship again. We didn’t have sex until after a while (it was the best), she told me she didn’t want to make a move because she said sex would onky complicate things. I don’t know if I should move forward?

TL:DR yeah, we found each other again and she asked for another chance but not sure if I should move forward?

";57;This is one of the rare cases where I'd suggest giving them another chance. She made a drunken mistaken peer pressured by some shitty friends whom she has since cut off. That kind of cheating is so much easier to forgive than if she actually developed feelings for someone else and cheated more than once. She obviously loves you a lot and would do anything for you. And from what you said, it seems she was actually a great girlfriend up until the incident. You're definitely gonna have trust issues whenever she goes out though, and that'll be tough to handle. However that's gonna happen with anyone you date now. At least with Katrina it's already happened, and you know she'll make sure it never happens again.;11;0.1929824561403509;[[0.9683867]];[[0.5776789]];0.9918;0.124;0.802;0.07400000000000001;0.8746;0.18600000000000003;0.6920000000000001;0.122;-0.014;0.19671442687747034;0.2101010101010101;-0.01338658322353975

She told me I could choose what would happen with the relationship and she said she would especially love it if I would let her fix it for us. I couldn’t do it but she still went to therapy.

She always tried to contact me after we broke up and she would always send little messages like “miss you, I’m very sorry and I knwo I’m shitty for what happened and I will be waiting for you and only you, I hooe this can work out and I still love you”. Then she would ask how I was and she always asked if I needed anything. I felt depressed but I just started working out and talked with a Life Coach (she’s amazing) and she helped me get myself sorted out and off of alcohol and weed. Time passed, I tried to look for a good woman but could never find one as good as Karina. They all seem too immature or not “girlfriend material” mostly just “fuck buddies” and those type of crazy girls.

I went to a small restaraunt in town, where I met Karina and had some good memories, then I went and stopped by at the plaza where we always went to hang out and where we first kissed. They were some good memories and something extremelly unexpected happened. I saw Karina there just sitting on of the beches by the fountain. I got really nervous and I just stayed where I was and she looked around and saw me. I can’t forget her face, she looked really happy and her face turned red and I saw some tears.

No. The way you compare other women to your ex is wrong: they are all infinitely better then her because they didn't cheat on you. ""Peer pressure"" is just an excuse, a very weak one. She wanted to cheat on you and took the opportunity, ""peer pressure"" helped her to ease the feeling of guilt.

Cheating creates a large crack throughout a relationship that never really goes away. You can patch it up a bit and maybe paint some good memories over the crack, but it is always still there. 

Everyone has weak moments and times of insecurity where we look to the strength of our relationships for comfort and sanity. When you look to your relationship for that support, you will always be reminded on that major breach of trust and fidelity.

My ex who cheated on me 2 years ago wants to get back together, not sure if I should keep moving forward;t3_8cl155;47;"Okay please do not bash me over this. I’m 26, (about to be 27) my ex girlfriend Karina is 28. We were together from when I was 18 to when I was 25. Damn, nearly 7 years. The way she cheated was, I think probabky the most common way? She went out with her girlfriends to Vegas and she got drunk and peer pressured into it and she told me stopped in the beginning of when they started having sex. She called me crying and she drive back home immediately. She was crying when she got here and told me everything. She told me I could choose what would happen with the relationship and she said she would especially love it if I would let her fix it for us. I couldn’t do it but she still went to therapy.

She always tried to contact me after we broke up and she would always send little messages like “miss you, I’m very sorry and I knwo I’m shitty for what happened and I will be waiting for you and only you, I hooe this can work out and I still love you”. Then she would ask how I was and she always asked if I needed anything. I felt depressed but I just started working out and talked with a Life Coach (she’s amazing) and she helped me get myself sorted out and off of alcohol and weed. Time passed, I tried to look for a good woman but could never find one as good as Karina. They all seem too immature or not “girlfriend material” mostly just “fuck buddies” and those type of crazy girls.

I went to a small restaraunt in town, where I met Karina and had some good memories, then I went and stopped by at the plaza where we always went to hang out and where we first kissed. They were some good memories and something extremelly unexpected happened. I saw Karina there just sitting on of the beches by the fountain. I got really nervous and I just stayed where I was and she looked around and saw me. I can’t forget her face, she looked really happy and her face turned red and I saw some tears. She approached me and we just looked at each other for a few seconds until we hugged for a few minutes. She told me she has been dying to see me, she cried again and said she was grateful that I was at least talking to her.

We went out to eat, she was nice, a good woman still but she seemed to get everything together. She asked me to come back to her place because she got a lease on a new home (it was pretty nice and I’m proud of her) and we hung out at her place, and she asked me to spend the night. She told me I could sleep wherever and I slept in the guest room, then we kind of just started hanging out again. We talked about the cheating, she said she should have never put me through that and said she understands she won’t ever even put herself in the situation where it could possibly happen again. 

I also noticed she doesn’t hang out with her friends anymore, only her family. She re- introduced me to her family and they were all happy to see me again. She talked with me again, she told me she was ready whenever I wanted to have a relationship again. We didn’t have sex until after a while (it was the best), she told me she didn’t want to make a move because she said sex would onky complicate things. I don’t know if I should move forward?

TL:DR yeah, we found each other again and she asked for another chance but not sure if I should move forward?

";57;"I stand by that you never do the back slide.

Its great she has grown and changed a bit and you know why that happened?  Consequences to her actions.  So good on her.

There are 2 ways this will go.

1.  You have both not significantly changed in the time you were apart.  The issues you have are still going to be there and its going to be a giant waste of time.

2.  You have both significally changed in the time you were apart.  You are no longer the people you were when you were together, so you have to start at square 1 again, and odds are you are no longer as compatible because you have both changed so much.  Not likely to be successful.

This is a lot of time and effort you are betting on a woman that has already failed you, just to have a chance at either it happening again, or you not being compatable anymore.

I would say its very clear neither of you have done a lot of growing as you are clearly both still pining for each other, which means very little happened in that 2 years beyond 2 people doing nothing, but wishing they could turn back time.  Which is not at all healthy.

Either way you go I hope it works out for you.

If it does, buy a lottery ticket because you have the same odds of having a backslide work as you do winning the lottery.

She went out with her girlfriends to Vegas and she got drunk and peer pressured into it and she told me stopped in the beginning of when they started having sex. She called me crying and she drive back home immediately. She was crying when she got here and told me everything. She told me I could choose what would happen with the relationship and she said she would especially love it if I would let her fix it for us. I couldn’t do it but she still went to therapy.

She always tried to contact me after we broke up and she would always send little messages like “miss you, I’m very sorry and I knwo I’m shitty for what happened and I will be waiting for you and only you, I hooe this can work out and I still love you”. Then she would ask how I was and she always asked if I needed anything. I felt depressed but I just started working out and talked with a Life Coach (she’s amazing) and she helped me get myself sorted out and off of alcohol and weed. Time passed, I tried to look for a good woman but could never find one as good as Karina. They all seem too immature or not “girlfriend material” mostly just “fuck buddies” and those type of crazy girls.

I went to a small restaraunt in town, where I met Karina and had some good memories, then I went and stopped by at the plaza where we always went to hang out and where we first kissed. They were some good memories and something extremelly unexpected happened. I saw Karina there just sitting on of the beches by the fountain. I got really nervous and I just stayed where I was and she looked around and saw me. I can’t forget her face, she looked really happy and her face turned red and I saw some tears. She approached me and we just looked at each other for a few seconds until we hugged for a few minutes. She told me she has been dying to see me, she cried again and said she was grateful that I was at least talking to her.

We went out to eat, she was nice, a good woman still but she seemed to get everything together. She asked me to come back to her place because she got a lease on a new home (it was pretty nice and I’m proud of her) and we hung out at her place, and she asked me to spend the night. She told me I could sleep wherever and I slept in the guest room, then we kind of just started hanging out again. We talked about the cheating, she said she should have never put me through that and said she understands she won’t ever even put herself in the situation where it could possibly happen again. 

I also noticed she doesn’t hang out with her friends anymore, only her family. She re- introduced me to her family and they were all happy to see me again. She talked with me again, she told me she was ready whenever I wanted to have a relationship again. We didn’t have sex until after a while (it was the best), she told me she didn’t want to make a move because she said sex would onky complicate things. I don’t know if I should move forward?

TL:DR yeah, we found each other again and she asked for another chance but not sure if I should move forward?

Edit : there is just one thing which doesn't sound right is the ""she stopped as soon it began"". 

That's a classic cheater script. A lot of cheater says it
Why she didn't stopped when she followed him, or when they made out or when they removed their clothes or during the foreplay ? 

Imo they did the full thing, and then she realized it and she told you this in hope it would lighten her betrayal.

";57;"Take it slowly, but I say, if you still feel you have feelings for her, give her another chance. If it doesn't work out, you haven't lost anything. I wouldn't normally tell someone to take back an ex who cheated, but it sounds like she is genuinely remorseful and has taken steps to improve herself (like cutting off her shitty friends and coming clean to you about it). While cheating is never okay, people do make mistakes, it's how we deal with the consequences that defines us.

If I were in your situation, I would give her another chance, especially since you've struggled to find someone else since the breakup. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, but at least you won't spend the rest of your life wondering what might have been.";1;0.017543859649122806;[[0.97372467]];[[0.58653304]];0.9918;0.124;0.802;0.07400000000000001;-0.7051;0.135;0.7020000000000001;0.16399999999999998;0.079;0.19671442687747034;-0.05925925925925925;0.2559736861367296

I got really nervous and I just stayed where I was and she looked around and saw me. I can’t forget her face, she looked really happy and her face turned red and I saw some tears. She approached me and we just looked at each other for a few seconds until we hugged for a few minutes. She told me she has been dying to see me, she cried again and said she was grateful that I was at least talking to her.

We went out to eat, she was nice, a good woman still but she seemed to get everything together. She asked me to come back to her place because she got a lease on a new home (it was pretty nice and I’m proud of her) and we hung out at her place, and she asked me to spend the night. She told me I could sleep wherever and I slept in the guest room, then we kind of just started hanging out again. We talked about the cheating, she said she should have never put me through that and said she understands she won’t ever even put herself in the situation where it could possibly happen again. 

I also noticed she doesn’t hang out with her friends anymore, only her family. She re- introduced me to her family and they were all happy to see me again. She talked with me again, she told me she was ready whenever I wanted to have a relationship again. We didn’t have sex until after a while (it was the best), she told me she didn’t want to make a move because she said sex would onky complicate things. I don’t know if I should move forward?

TL:DR yeah, we found each other again and she asked for another chance but not sure if I should move forward?

";57;"Assuming she was honest originally in that she stopped what she was doing, called you immediately, confessed what she had done without omitting any truth, and came right home to you and asked to do whatever it took to fix things, this would be one of the very rare times where forgiveness for cheating is something I would consider. You chose to end it and that's a perfectly respectable decision.

If she's been holding out hope of getting back together with you for the last two years, has dropped her shitty friends and made some self-improvements, that combined with what happened before makes me inclined to say that giving her another chance might not to a bad call.

My ex who cheated on me 2 years ago wants to get back together, not sure if I should keep moving forward;t3_8cl155;47;"Okay please do not bash me over this. I’m 26, (about to be 27) my ex girlfriend Karina is 28. We were together from when I was 18 to when I was 25. Damn, nearly 7 years. The way she cheated was, I think probabky the most common way? She went out with her girlfriends to Vegas and she got drunk and peer pressured into it and she told me stopped in the beginning of when they started having sex. She called me crying and she drive back home immediately. She was crying when she got here and told me everything. She told me I could choose what would happen with the relationship and she said she would especially love it if I would let her fix it for us. I couldn’t do it but she still went to therapy.

She always tried to contact me after we broke up and she would always send little messages like “miss you, I’m very sorry and I knwo I’m shitty for what happened and I will be waiting for you and only you, I hooe this can work out and I still love you”. Then she would ask how I was and she always asked if I needed anything. I felt depressed but I just started working out and talked with a Life Coach (she’s amazing) and she helped me get myself sorted out and off of alcohol and weed. Time passed, I tried to look for a good woman but could never find one as good as Karina. They all seem too immature or not “girlfriend material” mostly just “fuck buddies” and those type of crazy girls.

";57;Honestly, do what you feel is right in your heart. She hurt you and broke a level of trust that you developed after 7 years together. She regretted what she did, she came clean to you, she respected your decision to leave the relationship. This is all good. It's clear that you respect yourself a great deal as well, and I think that's really awesome. You are level-headed and know what you deserve. It seems like shes changed, but I think your smart to take it slow. You will know if it's right or not. Don't listen to other peoples opinions. Do what you think is best for your life.

";57;"It's easy to reminisce only about the nice things in a relationship, especially if you're in a idyllic place. BUT why is she approaching you now that she sees you get healthy mentally and physically? Why was she not there to support that change in you back then? Why did she listen to her friends. 

Betrayal is nearly impossible to get over. When you get into a fight, and trust you will, the first thing that will come back to you is this way in which she hurt you. Next time she goes out on a trip, the memory will stay in the back of your mind like a spine, and you will go crazy thinking what she's doing and who she is with. I'd say it's easier to move on and finding someone new, than moving on from that memory and staying with the person that did you so much damage that contributed to your depression.

She can blame it on her friends all she wants. You can say you abused alcohol and weed (where was she then to show support?), and maybe even take some of the blame, but the fact is he made a decision and took it. It's so easy to say she's sorry, but she had to have another guy inside her to realize how much she valued you? GMAFB. 

You haven't given yourself time to meet someone else. Of course, you couldn't think of dating someone else after such a lengthy relationship. You've barely been over a year apart. You've needed time and space to heal and she's the one constantly reaching out to you. Of course you shouldn't focus on seeing other people. You need learn to love and be at peace with yourself, before you can find someone else. And it seems this girl is being selfish and not willing to let you go. 

Sorry, I think this girl is messing with your head and you're settling for nothing. Crying on cue is easy. Ask yourself how it came to that. It's understandable - you were each others' first serious relationship, and you start thinking of all the chances that are passing you by when you see your friends being happy doing stuff without being in a relationship. You owe it to yourself to see the world, travel, do stuff and meet new people, free of all commitments. She also has the right to find happiness and she clearly wasn't when she decided to cheat on you. So now you are free to choose, either go back to the same old same old, or you get the closure you want, and move on to uncharted territories, which may seem scary at first but it's not, really. Truth is, this ship should've sailed for her years ago. Why you want to settle for a cheater is not something I understand. ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". Good luck.

She told me I could choose what would happen with the relationship and she said she would especially love it if I would let her fix it for us. I couldn’t do it but she still went to therapy.

She always tried to contact me after we broke up and she would always send little messages like “miss you, I’m very sorry and I knwo I’m shitty for what happened and I will be waiting for you and only you, I hooe this can work out and I still love you”. Then she would ask how I was and she always asked if I needed anything. I felt depressed but I just started working out and talked with a Life Coach (she’s amazing) and she helped me get myself sorted out and off of alcohol and weed. Time passed, I tried to look for a good woman but could never find one as good as Karina. They all seem too immature or not “girlfriend material” mostly just “fuck buddies” and those type of crazy girls.

I went to a small restaraunt in town, where I met Karina and had some good memories, then I went and stopped by at the plaza where we always went to hang out and where we first kissed. They were some good memories and something extremelly unexpected happened. I saw Karina there just sitting on of the beches by the fountain. I got really nervous and I just stayed where I was and she looked around and saw me. I can’t forget her face, she looked really happy and her face turned red and I saw some tears. She approached me and we just looked at each other for a few seconds until we hugged for a few minutes. She told me she has been dying to see me, she cried again and said she was grateful that I was at least talking to her.

We went out to eat, she was nice, a good woman still but she seemed to get everything together. She asked me to come back to her place because she got a lease on a new home (it was pretty nice and I’m proud of her) and we hung out at her place, and she asked me to spend the night. She told me I could sleep wherever and I slept in the guest room, then we kind of just started hanging out again. We talked about the cheating, she said she should have never put me through that and said she understands she won’t ever even put herself in the situation where it could possibly happen again. 

I also noticed she doesn’t hang out with her friends anymore, only her family. She re- introduced me to her family and they were all happy to see me again. She talked with me again, she told me she was ready whenever I wanted to have a relationship again. We didn’t have sex until after a while (it was the best), she told me she didn’t want to make a move because she said sex would onky complicate things. I don’t know if I should move forward?

TL:DR yeah, we found each other again and she asked for another chance but not sure if I should move forward?

";57;"If you want her to cheat on you again then give her another chance as she is a cheater and she will do the same thing again with you if you be with her again. You can do things much better without her in your life. It has been 2 years so no need to open the old wounds again. 

However, it sounds here that you are inclined to give her another chance and in that case make sure that you take things slowly with her unless you get full confidence on her that she has changed herself and she will not cheat on you again before you committed to the relationship.

He has taken steps to recovery. He is seeing a therapist and claims he will stop, both are good things. He seems to be taking some degree of ownership of the behaviour, that is important because the reality is that when he drinks he is ultimately choosing to accept all behaviours that come with it. 

But drinking to self medicate, to the point he was drinking himself to the point of waking unconsciousness, well that is a big deal and a long and hard path to recovery. If you believe that if he stops you have the potential to be happy then definitely consider supporting him but be clear to yourself and him that the second he is off the wagon you are walking.

Moving in with someone you haven't been dating long can create a whole lot of issues.

So I (21 M) met this girl (18 F) around 4 months ago and I thought we really hit it off and I like her a lot but recently she has pretty much ignored me completely and I don't know what I should think of that.

Around 6 weeks ago we had a date that didn't go that well because she had a stressful week and it felt like she'd rather stayed at home that day instead of coming over which I completely understand but I think I wasn't showing enough that I do. Anyway we didn't have an argument or anything like that so I thought things would be fine, I apologized anyway the next day but didn't get an answer for 3 days until I asked if everything's okay and if she'd like to meet the next weekend. 

She said that she was busy, I wrote again a week later and busy again, I wrote some days later and she didn't answer, I asked again some days later and she said that she would be busy again. I wrote another time after 2 days and didn't get an answer until I wrote again after 2 additional days where she suddenly wanted to meet me the next day. I was happy and confused but we met and she seemed like nothing ever changed and we had sex two times and everything seemed great now.

It wasn't though and she wouldn't answer my next 3 messenges again which were again separated by days only to say that she was again busy but wished she'd see me again soon. That was two weeks ago and she hasn't replied to any of my 5 messages yet and I even said in my 4th one just a few days ago that I'd like to know what's going on between us because I want to fix it.

This is my first real relationship and I'm not good at understanding social things (at all) and I also don't want things to end between us so I really need advice on how to proceed or what's happening no matter how obvious it may seem. Thank you very much for reading and trying to help.";2;"**You are an adult dating a child, and she's acting like a child... are you surprised?**

Do you remember what a random insecure idiot you were when you were 18? I know it was only 3 years ago, but you can see how much you changed from the guy you were in HS right?
 
Most people can, so if you don't see it, trust me - the change is massive.
 
She's no different. She's an random insecure idiot and she's not yet chosen to actually be an adult and act like an adult in an adult relationship, which is why she's not yet committed herself to you beyond dates and some hooking up.

It doesn't matter if you want things between you to end. They will end because while 3 years is no big deal to a 30 year old, the difference between 18 and 21 is fucking massive. 

The other thing is, why don't you want it to end?
 
Because she treats you well? She is respectful when she ignores you and blows you off? You really get a kick out of people who are too busy for you?
 
You don't want it to end for one simple reason. You don't like the idea of being alone.
 
Being with someone who doesn't really want you isn't a good life.
 
End it and find someone who wants you as much as you want them.

You didn't ""regress"". You just realized that you weren't ready yet for contact with your ex. Just means you need more time without contact. 

Also, it might just have been that she didn't want her BF (who knows you) to come and meet her just to find the two of you chatting it up. 

Who knows, she may have told the guy that she doesn't talk to you anymore, so if he saw you guys chatting, it could raise all sorts of questions she didn't want to bother answering.

I (21m) saw my ex (21f) after months of not talking and it triggered something, need advice?;t3_8coizk;3;"so my ex and i broke up back in december , over nothing but the breakup itself was quite bad. Were at the same uni doing the same course, luckily she took a year out so is in the year below me so we dont share classes.

Anyway ive been trying to move forward, she had a rebound for a month which ended and is now dating her male best friend, who she lived with when we were together and still does.

Anyway i saw her today in our department building, in a common area she was came in and sat the other end of the room to me, i saw her notice me then she turned away. turned out she was waiting for her new boyfriend. I really want her to be happy but seeing her triggered so many feelings, i wanted to run up and talk to her. ive been away fro the last couple months and haven't had to see her but seeing her now i realised i still love her. 

What do i do ? i texted her a few weeks ago apologising for my part in the break up she said she had no ill feelings towards me anymore (she told me she hated me after we broke up) and she was sorry too. I really want her to be happy but she couldn't even look at me across a room and that hurt. she walked right past me with him pretending not to see me. I feel like ive regressed months of progress.";2;"You know, sometimes relationships just go sour. There's no guarantee you can return to how things were before it happened.

So to be transparent, if you are the one who pays for the more expensive dates, are you the one who in summa pays more? Or does it even out? If it evens out, and you have this agreement of sometimes him paying for the date and sometimes you paying for the date, then it makes sense that this time you pay for the date with the expectation that it will even out, as it has in the past. 

You can ask him to pay half, and it's certainly not unfair, but since this has not been your modus operandi in your relationship, it would upset things unncessarily.

&gt; as the man should he pay for it?

No. He should pay for it because it would be considered fair, not because ""he's the man"".";1;0.5;[[0.95908145]];[[0.73615239]];0.7922;0.083;0.888;0.03;-0.3691;0.048;0.885;0.067;0.07200000000000001;0.009375;0.1027777777777778;-0.09340277777777778

I [18M] turned down sex from my [17F] partner and she seems rather upset....;t3_8ckefo;22;"I've been dating my partner for almost 4 months and tonight, after getting dinner with her family and seeing a movie we got kind of intimate, on the front seat of my truck. She has been in one previous relationship and has some experience, while she is my first... for literally everything... It's sad to say but before her I've never even kissed anyone. 

Back to this evening though, things started slow and kinda roller coastered from there, we never really got crazy with french kissing so I'm not that used to it but she was just really going for it tonight. I was just trying to keep from looking like a completely inexperienced idiot... Before I knew it we were up to bat so-to-say. First base was blown through, then second, and then running for third... At that point she went to undo my belt and slip her hand in, and I just kinda slowly stopped her. 

 I explained to her that this was all going like **really** fast. I also said how I really wouldn't want to have this happen for the first time while we were crammed in the from seat of my truck, we were already pretty much doing yoga to fit onto the seat how we were. I also kinda found it strange this was happening in broad daylight, in a movie theater parking lot. I also looked down and saw we knocked over what was left of 2 milkshakes from earlier and her purse was sitting in a puddle of milk on my floor. 

She knows I'm new to all this already, and that shes my first. But, after I explained this all to her she all but started to tear up, said she was an idiot and how embarrassed she was. I tried explaining to her I just really didn't want this to happen here, of all places. She wasn't having any of it though, even after dropping her off at her house a few hours later I could tell just the way she was acting she was still pretty upset. 

Was I wrong to stop? Should I have just kept going and seen where things went? I feel really bad and I know shes upset and I really hate that, we've been so great until this point but she just seems so dissatisfied after tonight. It's not like I can really talk to anybody off of reddit about this, my friends would probably just laugh at me for blocking myself, my brothers (32,24) would both just laugh hysterically and tell every possible person about it. I don't know what to do, I feel like I drove a massive wedge between us tonight. It really never bothered me that I'm a virgin, I was just waiting for that special someone and I think I finally found them.

Thanks to those that are reading this. 

[Tl:dr] My girlfriend and myself were getting into it in a movie theater parking lot when I stopped her advances at taking it **further**, mostly cause of my lack of experience, but also because I really don't want my first time to be on the front seat of a pickup truck.

You'll need to explain and emphasise to her that it wasn't anything to do with your attraction to her that you said no. Just explain that you would want the setting to be more private and comfortable for the both of you, so you can take your sweet time and enjoy her.

Also, don't be self conscious about being new to everything. If she's with you and knows you're new to it all, then it shouldn't bother her. Hell, she might even be into that kind of thing. Just put in effort to pleasing her and do some research if you're not as informed as you'd like to be, and just ask her what she likes.

I know when my Bf (together 4 years and each other’s first) has rejected me, usually because he was extremely tired, I was close to tears as well. For me it’s cause I’m being extremely vulnerable by initiating and to be rejected feels crappie.

I also looked down and saw we knocked over what was left of 2 milkshakes from earlier and her purse was sitting in a puddle of milk on my floor. 

She knows I'm new to all this already, and that shes my first. But, after I explained this all to her she all but started to tear up, said she was an idiot and how embarrassed she was. I tried explaining to her I just really didn't want this to happen here, of all places. She wasn't having any of it though, even after dropping her off at her house a few hours later I could tell just the way she was acting she was still pretty upset. 

Was I wrong to stop? Should I have just kept going and seen where things went? I feel really bad and I know shes upset and I really hate that, we've been so great until this point but she just seems so dissatisfied after tonight. It's not like I can really talk to anybody off of reddit about this, my friends would probably just laugh at me for blocking myself, my brothers (32,24) would both just laugh hysterically and tell every possible person about it. I don't know what to do, I feel like I drove a massive wedge between us tonight. It really never bothered me that I'm a virgin, I was just waiting for that special someone and I think I finally found them.

Thanks to those that are reading this. 

[Tl:dr] My girlfriend and myself were getting into it in a movie theater parking lot when I stopped her advances at taking it **further**, mostly cause of my lack of experience, but also because I really don't want my first time to be on the front seat of a pickup truck. 


*Edit* I'm apparently terrible at formatting. 

*Edit 2* Thank you all for the helpful advice and tips. We're going out again this weekend so I'm definetley gonna try and talk to her. If anything I just felt really werid talking to anybody I know about it because like some have said, it seems like guys are *expected* to always want sex. I don't feel that way at all and I honestly care more about the emotional connection, but I don't think many people would really understand that. Once again, thanks for everybody that read, and helped me out here. I truly appreciate it. ";33;"You weren't wrong to stop her, you should be totally open and honest about how you feel about sex.

That being said, I get how it's hard for anyone to put themselves out there and get rejected. Probably especially true for a teenage girl, with all the shit teenage girl deals with. So while you are in the right for sure, you should try to be empathetic to her. Make sure she feels special and knows how you feel about her.";16;0.48484848484848486;[[0.96562946]];[[0.47094118]];0.9934;0.146;0.763;0.091;0.9607;0.257;0.695;0.048;-0.15400000000000005;0.0020903792388167284;0.16259920634920635;-0.16050882711038966

Back to this evening though, things started slow and kinda roller coastered from there, we never really got crazy with french kissing so I'm not that used to it but she was just really going for it tonight.

It would have been an awkward, clumsy and unsatisfying act if you had gone ahead. Her getting that into it shows that she may have been doing it for the wrong reasons too, like she had to suddenly prove you liked her or something, it's why she suddenly 'woke up' in a sense when you said to stop. 

Keep your eye on that. I suspect she has a lot more anxiety than she lets on. It might be worth talking about why she suddenly got so fixated on it. Did she think that is what you wanted or perhaps just that it was something she 'ought' to do? Was she worried that it hadn't happened yet and whether that reflected on the relationship?

So I felt really dirty and so emberessed.  The guy was also upset, but asked me what happend and made me very  clear that he did want me, and arranged a nice setting die his first time.

I can understand why she was so upset. Now this is really messed up trust me, but culturally girls learn that guys want sex all the time and will take whatever they can get. Being shot down like that made her feel super unwanted because guys are ""supposed"" to be begging for sex. Your wanting to wait is honorable but uncommon.

I also looked down and saw we knocked over what was left of 2 milkshakes from earlier and her purse was sitting in a puddle of milk on my floor. 

She knows I'm new to all this already, and that shes my first. But, after I explained this all to her she all but started to tear up, said she was an idiot and how embarrassed she was. I tried explaining to her I just really didn't want this to happen here, of all places. She wasn't having any of it though, even after dropping her off at her house a few hours later I could tell just the way she was acting she was still pretty upset. 

Was I wrong to stop? Should I have just kept going and seen where things went? I feel really bad and I know shes upset and I really hate that, we've been so great until this point but she just seems so dissatisfied after tonight. It's not like I can really talk to anybody off of reddit about this, my friends would probably just laugh at me for blocking myself, my brothers (32,24) would both just laugh hysterically and tell every possible person about it. I don't know what to do, I feel like I drove a massive wedge between us tonight. It really never bothered me that I'm a virgin, I was just waiting for that special someone and I think I finally found them.

Thanks to those that are reading this. 

[Tl:dr] My girlfriend and myself were getting into it in a movie theater parking lot when I stopped her advances at taking it **further**, mostly cause of my lack of experience, but also because I really don't want my first time to be on the front seat of a pickup truck. 


*Edit* I'm apparently terrible at formatting. 

*Edit 2* Thank you all for the helpful advice and tips. We're going out again this weekend so I'm definetley gonna try and talk to her. If anything I just felt really werid talking to anybody I know about it because like some have said, it seems like guys are *expected* to always want sex. I don't feel that way at all and I honestly care more about the emotional connection, but I don't think many people would really understand that. Once again, thanks for everybody that read, and helped me out here. I truly appreciate it. ";33;"Not wrong of you to stop. 

You should never do something you're not comfortable with. 

It seems like she's more upset at the fact that she put you in an uncomfortable position rather than you turning down the sex. 

All you really can do is reassure her it's okay and hope she gets over it soon. 

You didn't do anything wrong she's just reacting extremely. ";5;0.15151515151515152;[[0.97180704]];[[0.51336814]];0.9934;0.146;0.763;0.091;0.5288;0.185;0.6859999999999999;0.13;0.0;0.0020903792388167284;-0.003395061728395062;0.005485440967211791

She has been in one previous relationship and has some experience, while she is my first... for literally everything... It's sad to say but before her I've never even kissed anyone. 

Back to this evening though, things started slow and kinda roller coastered from there, we never really got crazy with french kissing so I'm not that used to it but she was just really going for it tonight. I was just trying to keep from looking like a completely inexperienced idiot... Before I knew it we were up to bat so-to-say. First base was blown through, then second, and then running for third... At that point she went to undo my belt and slip her hand in, and I just kinda slowly stopped her.

It takes a lot of balls (pardon the expression) to put yourself forward like that. I'm a 23yo female and reading this alone made me cringe, let alone putting myself in her position. 

You were right to stop it and she likely knows that too. In a non-fired up state, I highly doubt she would ideally want your guys first time to be under those circumstances. She probably just feels very awkward, uncomfortable and humiliated - despite YOU reacting COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY correctly in this situation. You not only have the right, but also the NEED to be able to say ""no"" at any point and have that respected.

I mean, if she starts acting cold or butthurt or accusatory towards you now, then re-evaluate this relationship, but my guess is that it's just gonna be a little awkward next time you see her and she may be a little more hesitant when it comes to initiating again.";3;0.09090909090909091;[[0.98271965]];[[0.61736191]];0.9934;0.146;0.763;0.091;-0.527;0.079;0.8059999999999999;0.115;0.091;0.0020903792388167284;0.01881493506493508;-0.01672455582611835

You provided honest and open communication and mentioned you didn’t like where you were.  None of these things were a judgment about her and yet she fell apart. 

Decide if you want your first time to be with someone so emotionally fragile.  
Disappointment on her side is one thing, tears about it is another. 
You may be getting into more problems down the road when you need to discuss safe sex and just anything about your relationship.

I feel really bad and I know shes upset and I really hate that, we've been so great until this point but she just seems so dissatisfied after tonight. It's not like I can really talk to anybody off of reddit about this, my friends would probably just laugh at me for blocking myself, my brothers (32,24) would both just laugh hysterically and tell every possible person about it. I don't know what to do, I feel like I drove a massive wedge between us tonight. It really never bothered me that I'm a virgin, I was just waiting for that special someone and I think I finally found them.

Thanks to those that are reading this. 

[Tl:dr] My girlfriend and myself were getting into it in a movie theater parking lot when I stopped her advances at taking it **further**, mostly cause of my lack of experience, but also because I really don't want my first time to be on the front seat of a pickup truck.

*Edit 2* Thank you all for the helpful advice and tips. We're going out again this weekend so I'm definetley gonna try and talk to her. If anything I just felt really werid talking to anybody I know about it because like some have said, it seems like guys are *expected* to always want sex. I don't feel that way at all and I honestly care more about the emotional connection, but I don't think many people would really understand that. Once again, thanks for everybody that read, and helped me out here. I truly appreciate it. ";33;A woman seeks to thrill a man. She's trying to engage you in a way she hopes is filling you with uncontrollable lust and desire for her. If your going to shut her down you really need to do it in a way that seems tortured. By that I mean expressing your desperate desire to have her but...then make an excuse. In this case that your too shy to have sex in a parking lot in broad daylight might not be enough. It seems intended to be a fuck it all, I'm having you now kinda moment. The milkshake spill, parking lot, etc. Is kinda a cliche image of fuck it all passion. She wanted you right there so bad she didn't give a fuck. The fact that you responded the way you did without disarming or acknowledging her intense passion I think might be a mistake with permanent consequence. ;2;0.06060606060606061;[[0.97291823]];[[0.58236239]];0.9934;0.146;0.763;0.091;-0.8439;0.127;0.71;0.163;0.091;0.0020903792388167284;-0.19784580498866208;0.1999361842274788
I [18M] turned down sex from my [17F] partner and she seems rather upset....;t3_8ckefo;22;"I've been dating my partner for almost 4 months and tonight, after getting dinner with her family and seeing a movie we got kind of intimate, on the front seat of my truck. She has been in one previous relationship and has some experience, while she is my first... for literally everything... It's sad to say but before her I've never even kissed anyone. 

Back to this evening though, things started slow and kinda roller coastered from there, we never really got crazy with french kissing so I'm not that used to it but she was just really going for it tonight. I was just trying to keep from looking like a completely inexperienced idiot... Before I knew it we were up to bat so-to-say. First base was blown through, then second, and then running for third... At that point she went to undo my belt and slip her hand in, and I just kinda slowly stopped her. 

 I explained to her that this was all going like **really** fast. I also said how I really wouldn't want to have this happen for the first time while we were crammed in the from seat of my truck, we were already pretty much doing yoga to fit onto the seat how we were. I also kinda found it strange this was happening in broad daylight, in a movie theater parking lot. I also looked down and saw we knocked over what was left of 2 milkshakes from earlier and her purse was sitting in a puddle of milk on my floor. 

She knows I'm new to all this already, and that shes my first. But, after I explained this all to her she all but started to tear up, said she was an idiot and how embarrassed she was. I tried explaining to her I just really didn't want this to happen here, of all places. She wasn't having any of it though, even after dropping her off at her house a few hours later I could tell just the way she was acting she was still pretty upset.

A girl - remember this for your whole life - will always feel hurt if she offers sex and you decline. 

That doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't decline... but she'll never forget. 

Something held you back. You didn't like the situation, the spot, the view, the lighting... whatever. Don't let people make you feel bad about that.

But if you care for this girl, find her soon and talk. Be honest and vulnerable. Not as a trick, but as an explanation. She needs one. 

Have fun with it. If she is more experienced, tell her you were nervous and let her guide you through the first-time. 

But find her and talk to her soon. It takes more experience - way more experience - to reject a woman and maintain some semblance of a relationship. That part will be true forever.

I need some advice on how to deal with my grandmother.;t3_8cib2n;3;"I’m staying with family due to your old fashioned Lemony Snicket. My grandmother is starting to fall apart despite an average beginning line of communication. This is going to be ridiculously long, and I’m on mobile, so I get you guys. To save you some scrolling, I’ll put the everso basic TL;DR underneath this paragraph. As shit goes downhill, I grow more concerned about my situation, and by extension, hers as well. To outline what’s been going on:

TL;DR: My family is outright insane and may be unsafe. Right now, however, I deal with my unstable (but childishly docile) grandmother and need coping tips until I can leave. 

- She has a hoarding and bidding problem. Her house is infested with carpet beetles and these creepy silver bugs that look like earwigs. Ants are also a problem, especially considering the mouldy food everywhere. She doesn’t take out her garbage, leaves cut up half eaten fruit everywhere, and her fridges and cupboards are filled with expired foods she eats daily.

- She refuses to buy groceries for herself. Because I moved to a new province in my late second trimester, I am unable to find work. I am on social assistance, and receive a food hamper monthly through a baby group I am in. She eats the food allotted to myself, and doesn’t replace a thing.

- I am in the process of getting a bus pass. In the meantime, she’s offered to help get me to the few groups I am in (counselling, baby group, and a cooking class through the baby group to help teach me healthy food for 6+months). Lately she has reneged on this, and without warning. It has caused a trust issue where I can’t rely on her as previously told I could. She’ll tell me that she’ll take me (to the vet, to buy groceries, to fill out paperwork for my health cards, etc) and then spend the entirety of that day avoiding me, on her computer in her room, even if I knock.

- She rarely gets dressed. Despite never cooking, cleaning, bathing, or buying groceries, she buys fast food or pizza every other day. Just the other day, she drove to Tim Horton’s naked under a bathrobe, without shoes. She got out of the car and wandered around the front of the house, trying to figure out who I was with (her stepdaughter).

- If she isn’t asking inappropriate or bizarre questions (when was the first time you had sex? Were you scared? Did you every have an imaginary boyfriend? Have you ever had a sore throat before?), she repeats questions, or confuses days despite knowing what day it is the day of. For example, she grilled me about my trip with her stepdaughter (my aunt). The conversation went as follows:

“Who was that?”
“Aunt and her friends younger sister. We looked after her today while doing errands.”
“Who was that in the back?”
“The young girl?”
“Who was that in the front?”
“It was Aunt.” Two minutes pass.
“Who were those two that dropped you off?”

Two days passed and she asked me how my day was (insinuating that day) with Aunt, knowing full well two days had passed since midweek.

- She also has a bad habit of telling me inappropriate things, like her medical conditions, infections, and what hole the medication or tubing goes in and whether or not it “stays in place”.

- She mistreats my dog, and oversteps the boundaries I have with him. She feeds him her leftovers without making him work for it, ignoring me loudly announcing he is not to have any table scraps. She then complains that he won’t leave her food alone while she’s eating, blames me for it (he doesn’t do it with me because I don’t feed him scraps, make him work for treats, and am stern and stationary with him). She swats him in the face and body, and yells at him for subsequently nipping at her hands. She then puts him outside without supervision and complains that I go outside too often when I follow after (lately he’s been devouring sticks, which causes him to throw up for hours, so he can’t be trusted alone).

- She refuses to accept medical or psychiatric help, despite always complaining that she needs it. Last conversation we had about it, she said something along the lines of “last time I get like this, I was in the hospital for two years”. I spoke to my other Aunt, who was meant to be her end-of-life care aid (as licensed to do so) about the majority of this situation. She told me that grandma must be going through a “manic episode” again. She had never been in the hospital longer than an hour.

- My youngest siblings were given up for adoption by my mother. She gave away all of her kids, including myself, and it’s been an ongoing case with the ministry. It was through this that I found out not only am I deemed as a potential threat to my siblings mental health (my mom has gone through episodes of extreme paranoia. She pulled the two youngest out of school, out of every group, and papered the windows. She refused to let them (6, and 8) leave the house, and would leave them at home alone for hours. During this time, she would tell them things like, “you were assaulted by people. Everyone. And that’s why you need to stay here. Your family tried to hurt you. Your family will hurt me. You can’t speak to the family any more, they are evil”). I also learned that my grandmother had in fact abused all of her daughters, except the Aunt I’ve been spending time with. As clarification, I want to say that I may not know about my grandma’s whole past, but even my aunts and I, who have had positive relationships throughout their childhoods, are deemed a threat. I really only met my siblings once during a summer holiday, and I talked to them over Skype regularly before my mother went into decline. Grandmother however, is completely barred from seeing them, while the case with the rest of us is in review.

- My grandmother agreed to be a temporary residence at my request. She wanted me here indefinitely. With the hoarding, the lack of self and house care, and my baby on the way, I feel uncomfortable (and unsafe now, as per the investigation) having my child here. I’m prepared to move at a moments notice, and when baby is born, my significant other is coming down from where we both lived before to find a place together. My plan is to have one before he gets here, and have him with me during labour. This has made her hostile towards me at times, demanding that I give her alone time with baby, that I let her visit often, and that I maybe just not leave at all, and my significant other can use the other blow up mattress. Yes. The blowup mattresses. Because for the longest of times, “there was no space in the empty room you use,” so I couldn’t have a bed. I finally said fuck that, and am in the process of having a bed delivered this week.

- She is upset that I dislike her unbelievably vast collection of dolls and nicknacks. This house looks like the 50s threw up, think hoarder, and puppy loves all the bajillions of stuffed animals and toys laying around. He hasn’t wrecked anything, and he can’t go two steps without having a toy in his face. I don’t blame him.

- She uses my baby supplies for her dolls when she thinks I’m not around. 

- This one is a mild frustration, but she has no concept of manners. She can’t figure out how to open a slice of cheese, let’s say, so she wordlessly holds it in front of my face until I open it for her.

- She expects me to handle her legal papers and casework despite my lack of knowledge in tennant law, wills and death, and my inability to file paperwork for her Disability claims.

* You need to get. This isn't a healthy place for you, your kid or your unborn child. Whatever it takes, whatever assistance you need, however you get it, you need to get the fuck out ASAP. If that house is half as disgusting and unsafe as you say and Child Welfare shows up, that house won't need baby gates anymore -if you get my meaning. Your kid will be removed.

* If your grandmother cannot take care of herself, clean or buy food, you need to (after you get out) call Adult Protection and have them stop in and see her and her living conditions. Let them decide if she's able to take care of herself properly.

I need some advice on how to deal with my grandmother.;t3_8cib2n;3;"I’m staying with family due to your old fashioned Lemony Snicket. My grandmother is starting to fall apart despite an average beginning line of communication. This is going to be ridiculously long, and I’m on mobile, so I get you guys. To save you some scrolling, I’ll put the everso basic TL;DR underneath this paragraph. As shit goes downhill, I grow more concerned about my situation, and by extension, hers as well. To outline what’s been going on:

TL;DR: My family is outright insane and may be unsafe. Right now, however, I deal with my unstable (but childishly docile) grandmother and need coping tips until I can leave. 

- She has a hoarding and bidding problem. Her house is infested with carpet beetles and these creepy silver bugs that look like earwigs. Ants are also a problem, especially considering the mouldy food everywhere. She doesn’t take out her garbage, leaves cut up half eaten fruit everywhere, and her fridges and cupboards are filled with expired foods she eats daily.

- She refuses to buy groceries for herself. Because I moved to a new province in my late second trimester, I am unable to find work. I am on social assistance, and receive a food hamper monthly through a baby group I am in. She eats the food allotted to myself, and doesn’t replace a thing.

- I am in the process of getting a bus pass. In the meantime, she’s offered to help get me to the few groups I am in (counselling, baby group, and a cooking class through the baby group to help teach me healthy food for 6+months). Lately she has reneged on this, and without warning. It has caused a trust issue where I can’t rely on her as previously told I could. She’ll tell me that she’ll take me (to the vet, to buy groceries, to fill out paperwork for my health cards, etc) and then spend the entirety of that day avoiding me, on her computer in her room, even if I knock.

- She rarely gets dressed. Despite never cooking, cleaning, bathing, or buying groceries, she buys fast food or pizza every other day. Just the other day, she drove to Tim Horton’s naked under a bathrobe, without shoes. She got out of the car and wandered around the front of the house, trying to figure out who I was with (her stepdaughter).

- If she isn’t asking inappropriate or bizarre questions (when was the first time you had sex? Were you scared? Did you every have an imaginary boyfriend? Have you ever had a sore throat before?), she repeats questions, or confuses days despite knowing what day it is the day of. For example, she grilled me about my trip with her stepdaughter (my aunt). The conversation went as follows:

“Who was that?”
“Aunt and her friends younger sister. We looked after her today while doing errands.”
“Who was that in the back?”
“The young girl?”
“Who was that in the front?”
“It was Aunt.” Two minutes pass.
“Who were those two that dropped you off?”

Two days passed and she asked me how my day was (insinuating that day) with Aunt, knowing full well two days had passed since midweek.

- She also has a bad habit of telling me inappropriate things, like her medical conditions, infections, and what hole the medication or tubing goes in and whether or not it “stays in place”.

- She mistreats my dog, and oversteps the boundaries I have with him. She feeds him her leftovers without making him work for it, ignoring me loudly announcing he is not to have any table scraps. She then complains that he won’t leave her food alone while she’s eating, blames me for it (he doesn’t do it with me because I don’t feed him scraps, make him work for treats, and am stern and stationary with him). She swats him in the face and body, and yells at him for subsequently nipping at her hands. She then puts him outside without supervision and complains that I go outside too often when I follow after (lately he’s been devouring sticks, which causes him to throw up for hours, so he can’t be trusted alone).

- She refuses to accept medical or psychiatric help, despite always complaining that she needs it. Last conversation we had about it, she said something along the lines of “last time I get like this, I was in the hospital for two years”. I spoke to my other Aunt, who was meant to be her end-of-life care aid (as licensed to do so) about the majority of this situation. She told me that grandma must be going through a “manic episode” again. She had never been in the hospital longer than an hour.

- My youngest siblings were given up for adoption by my mother. She gave away all of her kids, including myself, and it’s been an ongoing case with the ministry. It was through this that I found out not only am I deemed as a potential threat to my siblings mental health (my mom has gone through episodes of extreme paranoia. She pulled the two youngest out of school, out of every group, and papered the windows. She refused to let them (6, and 8) leave the house, and would leave them at home alone for hours. During this time, she would tell them things like, “you were assaulted by people. Everyone. And that’s why you need to stay here. Your family tried to hurt you. Your family will hurt me. You can’t speak to the family any more, they are evil”). I also learned that my grandmother had in fact abused all of her daughters, except the Aunt I’ve been spending time with. As clarification, I want to say that I may not know about my grandma’s whole past, but even my aunts and I, who have had positive relationships throughout their childhoods, are deemed a threat. I really only met my siblings once during a summer holiday, and I talked to them over Skype regularly before my mother went into decline. Grandmother however, is completely barred from seeing them, while the case with the rest of us is in review.

- My grandmother agreed to be a temporary residence at my request. She wanted me here indefinitely. With the hoarding, the lack of self and house care, and my baby on the way, I feel uncomfortable (and unsafe now, as per the investigation) having my child here. I’m prepared to move at a moments notice, and when baby is born, my significant other is coming down from where we both lived before to find a place together. My plan is to have one before he gets here, and have him with me during labour. This has made her hostile towards me at times, demanding that I give her alone time with baby, that I let her visit often, and that I maybe just not leave at all, and my significant other can use the other blow up mattress. Yes. The blowup mattresses. Because for the longest of times, “there was no space in the empty room you use,” so I couldn’t have a bed. I finally said fuck that, and am in the process of having a bed delivered this week.

- She is upset that I dislike her unbelievably vast collection of dolls and nicknacks. This house looks like the 50s threw up, think hoarder, and puppy loves all the bajillions of stuffed animals and toys laying around. He hasn’t wrecked anything, and he can’t go two steps without having a toy in his face. I don’t blame him.

- She uses my baby supplies for her dolls when she thinks I’m not around. 

- This one is a mild frustration, but she has no concept of manners. She can’t figure out how to open a slice of cheese, let’s say, so she wordlessly holds it in front of my face until I open it for her.

- She expects me to handle her legal papers and casework despite my lack of knowledge in tennant law, wills and death, and my inability to file paperwork for her Disability claims.

- She keeps disabling my baby gates because “they’re an eyesore”.

- She is by all definition emotionally unstable. I wouldn’t be able to talk about any of The aforementioned things without her breaking down and sobbing, followed by extreme anger and possible eviction.

Serious : Anyone have a successful long distance relationship? [18F] My SO is moving one state over [18 /protecting identity] I want to start a long distance relationship but they are worried. We love each other, and both cry every-time the topic comes up.;t3_8d8luk;2;"Hey everyone,

I have a really serious situation.

So some background information. I got out of a 2 year long relationship with a pretty verbally abusive partner, around December. I swore off dating and just focused on myself and my friends. I hung out with some new people by the end of January, and I met someone who I instantly clicked with in a way that I never felt before. Within 2 weeks we were seeing each other and about 4 weeks we decided to take it to the serious level.

The problem is, this person is moving one state over at the end of summer (Or they are hoping). I am super excited for them because they had already been planning this, but the more we are together, the more we aren’t just in a fling. It’s been about 2 months now since we started dating, and we both admitted to each other that we love each other. I have never felt this way about someone and they haven’t either.

Long distance has come into question, but it’s hard to talk about because we both end up crying. They say that it would be super hard and wouldn’t know if it would work. They’ve seen so many long distance relationships go to shit. I think they may also be scared of commitment. I would be willing, even though it would be a lot of work. I know they’d be coming back occasionally because they are doing some jobs here and to see family and me. They say that they do not want to leave me, but have no idea what to do because they will just begin to start their adult life. We talk about this occasionally but we have been saying “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.”

I said I would basically take the leap and move there, and even give space, like get my own apartment. I have been looking at colleges there anyway (Before we met). I think they said that they wouldn’t mind but they don’t want me to go just for a boy.

I want to believe that this isn’t just a stupid fling. They said there would always be some type of connection, like romantic. I just want this to work. I can honestly see myself with them, which I know is a lot to say at such a young age but they are irreplaceable. I know even if we weren’t dating, we would be friends but I know it would break my fucking heart. 

I have super low self esteem, so basically I feel like I will be forgotten and replaced, even though they said that would not be the case, ever.

";1;"Whooooo girl. 

Ok. So.

I was in a long distance relationship twice with the same guy and we’re still together. So I feel qualified to give you some advice. 

We met in the summer in my hometown while I was in college and he was in grad school. We started dating 3 weeks before I had to go back for my last semester. I went to school one state over and it was fine. We called each other on the weekends and texted every day. I graduated and moved home and life was great. We really connected and we were both in it for the long haul. 

Before we met I had been planning on moving to China for at least a year and he knew this but didn’t really say much about it. I ended up being hired by the university I wanted and I moved to there. It was almost 2 years of separation, clear across the globe. We saw each other once during this time when I flew home for my nephew’s birth. 

Let me be perfectly honest, my relationship and having a successful LDR is not the norm. Generally, one side or the other is apprehensive about an LDR because they’re afraid to commit OR they’re afraid their SO will meet someone else while they’re separated. Most LDR’s don’t survive past 4-6 months. But if you can get over that hurdle, you’re more likely to stay together. 

An LDR will only work if both of you are 100% committed to: the relationship, communication, and being patient. If one of those things is lacking, then the chances of having a successful relationship drop significantly. 

I also highly recommend you have an end date. It doesn’t matter necessarily how long, but just having one is helpful. Knowing that, although it feels never ending, that there *is* an ending to the distance and separation is what sometimes will keep the momentum in the relationship. 

Don’t move for a guy. Move only if you would be okay with studying/living there even if you broke up. If you do move, make sure to fine and create a circle of friends separate from him and his circle. It’s okay to be in both but once again, having a support system if you break up is really important. Too often, someone gets caught up in the love and forgets that the relationship isn’t quite guaranteed, so they move and become solely dependent on their SO. Don’t be that person.  

Honestly, he doesn’t sound 100% committed and to top it off, you’re in a time of your life that you should be exploring and living life. I wouldn’t try to tie myself down so early. But try it out. There’s a possibility it could turn into a lifelong relationship, but don’t go in with that expectation.

My boyfriend says he needs space from me;t3_8cvauo;8;"My boyfriend [28/M] and I [26/F] have been on a long distance relationship for a year already. We are busy with our own careers but we manage to talk almost everyday. He never fails to say he miss me and he loves me. 

We message a little throughout the day but at the end of the day after his work and before i go to sleep we try to talk. Things have been extremely busy for him for the past weeks and we haven't been talking so much as before and sometimes when we talk he is already tired so he would not be responding well. I don't message him a lot during the day since he is working and I'm also working but when I see him online, I try to message him. It bothers me that i will see him online (active on fb or liking my fb post, etc) but he won't be responding to my messages so it would get me upset and he would justify it as forgetting to message or needing his alone time or he wasn't able to notice the messages. It would take hours for him to message back sometimes. We argue a lot about time and communication these past weeks because he would think I'm being too clingy and I think he is not giving time when he is having free time from work or after work. We were able to talk about it and try to talk to just meet halfway with our communication. We both agreed to it but recently, he messaged me that he wants space. He told me that he learned that if I give him space, then he wants to be with me but if i don't give him enough space, then he just wants his alone time. 

I don't know what to think and feel about this. I try to understand that he wants alone time but I don't know how much alone time he wants because we are not physically together, we don't message as much throughout the day, we just call at the end of the day before sleep. I don't know how much more space to give him. I am also confused with his message to me. Need advice on this. ";6;"My boyfriend and I are also LDR so I kinda understand the frustration you’re having. I’ve had the same frustration as well, and it always used to annoy me, but the fact of the matter is, is that even if he IS online and doing things, he doesn’t have to always message you.


My boyfriend and I have this unspoken rule after we say we’re going to bed, that we don’t message the other unless something is important (like a reminder or etc) or if we can’t sleep. It’s mostly because we say “goodnight” to have our alone time before bed, because we are both introverts and need that. I usually stay up an extra 2 hours after I tell my boyfriend goodnight because I need that time to be by myself, and do my own thing. Doesn’t mean I dislike my boyfriend, just means I need time away.


Your boyfriend may just need his time. He’s stressed, and probably copes by being alone. I don’t think its bad that you message him throughout the day, but it seems to me that maybe you need to discuss with him how you’re feeling, and come up with a solution to accommodate both of your needs.

Maybe he doesn't feel like talking to *anyone* and he just wants to browse fb. This isn't the answer you want but I've had partners like you who pressed me to talk to them whenever I had free time (and sometimes I just wanted quiet away from everyone after a long day) and it just made me resent them and want to talk to them less, because they were making it an obligation and not a choice, and would throw little tantrums and start fights over feeling neglected ""if you really loved me you'd want to talk to me all the time!"" To the point where I decided I'd rather be single than put up with their attempts to control when we communicated. In short, you can keep fighting with him about this and pushing the issue, but don't be surprised if one day he decides he's tired of it and ends things.

If she is hanging out with you a lot and having fun with you then it sounds that she likes you but you would only come to know whether she likes you as a friend or something more if you ask her out so be direct with her and ask her to go on a date with you and make sure that you mention the word date so nothing left for the confusion. 

Your situation says take the risk as there are chances that she will be your girlfriend sooner so go for it otherwise you will always resent yourself for taking the chance when you could.

We've been going out to museums and concerts and just been doing really fun stuff for the past 2 years, and i REALLY REALLY like her alot.... we always have alot of fun together all the time..  so  my question is...  one: i really like her and i really want to ask her to be my girlfriend..  but honestly I've never asked a girl something like that..  i don't even know where to start... like i don't want to scare her off or anything like that..  or have her think anything different of me..  how would i go about doing all that without her thinking different of me?
The second thing is..  well she is my supervisor at work..  and i see her and talk to her everyday there..  alot of times we do go out after work to eat and do stuff on the weekends but i try and keep the two things seperate...  i'm just wandering if asking her to be my girlfriend would affect all that? like i mean work and stuff..  and if that would be a good idea?  i do hang out with her almost every weekend and i really enjoy spending time with her...    i dont know..  i guess i just dont even know where to begin or what to do because i don't want to mess any of this up with her..";2;"Ouch 2 years? The longer you wait the more friends you become.

But in saying that go shoot your shot even if you miss you'll gain valuable experience from it.  It only becomes awkward afterwards if you make it awkward.

And just a little tip for you is when your doing something with her really ramp up the physical contact with her and flirt with her and just kiss her. Really ram it into her head that 'it just felt right' your not going to break the friendzone by asking politely. *Obviously use common sense if she isn't into the touching don't kiss her or if she pull away from the kiss* now remember saying no to a kiss isn't rejecting you it might just mean not now so just keep fitting and try again if it doesn't work actually ask if that fails give up.";1;0.5;[[0.94805854]];[[0.70828979]];0.9963;0.21899999999999997;0.7809999999999999;0.0;0.8903;0.127;0.7979999999999999;0.075;0.16699999999999998;0.05955882352941176;-0.019642857142857142;0.0792016806722689

but remember one thing, never ask a girl to be your girlfriend, that's like the worst dating mistake you can make.



Instead try to get more physical, if you never kissed then try to kiss her, if you kissed her already and keep dating, then you are kinda dating already and asking her to be your gf is stupid unless u are 12.


if you like a girl, you should show her that you like her and progress it on physical level e.g. start dating, start kissing, start sleeping";0;0.0;[[0.90243628]];[[0.6948036]];0.9963;0.21899999999999997;0.7809999999999999;0.0;0.3814;0.182;0.649;0.16899999999999998;0.206;0.05955882352941176;-0.3;0.35955882352941176

She has no idea I know yet. Neither does my friend (who i’ve known for about 10 years). Oh, and she gave him an STD which he has been harassing her for since he was unaware she had it.

If you're not ready to give full disclosure,  just give the 'it's not working for me' thing. Don't feel pressured to have this conversation until you are ready. Expect lies and victimhood, before it is all laid at your feet. Don't believe that shit. This was cowardly and immoral.

DUMP HIM as well. See above. They deserve each other.

Do not go to the prom. Instead grab a good male friend (or a few), hit the road and do male things. Identify your support-friends, family, etc--you will need them going forward.

Get over to the NoContact subreddit and learn why you need to go full no-contact - no calls, email, social media- from this day forward. You will not heal otherwise.

This is a bit daunting for users browsing reddit, so they're unlikely to read the whole thing.

It's ok to write a lot if you've got a lot to say. But perhaps you could insert some empty lines into your post, to break it into smaller, more palatable paragraphs?

I don't mean a stranger, I mean people we actually know in person. How am I supposed to keep him happy when there's too many women he compares me too. ;2;"This seems like the obvious solution to me but you've made no mention of doing so; talk to him, you need to communicate how you feel with him if you want any clarity. There isn't enough information given to know exactly what you mean by ""comparing"", so I'll give you two separate answers.

If compares you to other women by telling you that the other women are better than you, or by complimenting them in ways that make you uncomfortable, you need to have a serious talk about boundaries and his respect for you. There is a chance that he does not know that what he is doing hurts your feelings and if you don't communicate these feelings with him there is no way he can understand that he is doing something wrong.

There is also a chance that what he is saying isn't in an offensive or suggestive manner, and in this case you need to tell him that these things make you feel uncomfortable and/or hurt your feelings. From your message the only thing I can clearly see is that is that you feel like you are not enough for him, and once again, this is cause for a talk. 

Regardless of the situation, I just think that you need to communicate with him. It's amazing what can be accomplished just by COMMUNICATING with your partner. Best of luck to you!";1;0.5;[[0.955827]];[[0.5665313]];0.5719;0.087;0.9129999999999999;0.0;0.9822;0.193;0.713;0.094;-0.012000000000000009;0.1535714285714286;0.014950980392156876;0.13862044817927174
[20/m] doesn't know what to do after this argument I had with [19/f] girlfriend;t3_8cpssr;5;"So just a small overview my girlfriend and I have been together for over a year now.  Our relationship is pretty much LDR because she lives in the city and I live upstate, which makes it pretty hard to visit her all the time. I go to a university and she works. She's my first girlfriend and I love her very much. 

So I dropped my mother off at work and decide to pick her up because she is not too far away. I pick her up and we did not seem to say much to each other that ride. While she is still in the car I mention being unable to celebrate her birthday with her as Ill be traveling with family for two weeks and if she wanted to celebrate before or after, and then she rolls her eyes at me and continues to scroll on her phone. The ride continues and I asked her a question and she just continued to stay silent not saying anything which leads me to ask what's wrong? Still quiet. Now this is probably where I come at fault cause this was bothering me to death and I barraged her with questions(like 3-4 mentioning things I said during the car ride trying to figure out whats wrong) and I raised my voice because at this point I was getting frustrated. I pull over to a corner cause I didn't want this rage building in me to cause a car crash. Then the words that come out of her mouth are ""you're so stupid, you never use your brain ever"" ""I am starting to believe something is mentally wrong with you"". So angry me punches the wheel of the car and she proceeds to exit the car and walk away, Understandable. I ran after her down the block(I didn't make a big scene), and tried apologizing for the punching my wheel like that. She ignores that and tells me to leave me alone and that ""You are a huge embarrassment, always embarrassing me"". After that I turned around, went back to my car and drove home.

Now it has been a couple days later, absolutely 0 contact from her. I sent her a message the later that night apologizing for raising my voice and punching the wheel angrily, no reply. She didn't even bother reading it. I see when she's active and doesn't even bother to look at it. She has been distancing herself the week beforehand and I don't even know if she wants to end the relationship or not. I don't think this post would justify this but I am not this angry usually, i'm pretty easy going. 

But please if someone has been through this any advice to ease my brain would be of great help.

TL;DR: Pick up girlfriend, I said something to annoy her, She ignores me the whole ride, I get angry, raise my voice, hulk smash/punch a wheel, she leaves car and ignores me for a couple days. Doesn't know what she wants.";1;"The way she's acting is super passive aggressive, no wonder you were frustrated. It's not fair to act angry at someone and refuse to tell them why, that's really shitty tbh - I had an ex that used to do that to me, he would just suddenly storm off and refuse to tell me why. He was so immature and didn't give a fuck about how I felt - I realise now it was a manipulation tactic; he wanted to make me worry myself sick wondering what I could have done wrong so when he did tell me, I would be so relieved that I would just apologise. I recognise now that was emotional abuse. And from the way she was insulting you and putting you down for not reading her mind... she sounds like she's not too far off him really... if someone loves you, even when they're annoyed at you, they shouldn't insult you like that.

 If you really want to resolve it, I would text her and say something along the lines of:

""I'm sorry for reacting poorly out of frustration. However, I don't think it's fair that you insulted me and are refusing to tell me the problem. I don't want to lose you over this, but I still don't know what I've done wrong and if you won't tell me what the issue is, we can't resolve it.""

While whatever you may have done might be your fault, a relationship is a two way street and you have to work together to solve problems. If she's not willing to cooperate with you, then she's not mature enough to be in a relationship.";2;2.0;[[0.97368179]];[[0.60735649]];-0.7475;0.08199999999999999;0.807;0.111;-0.9652;0.1;0.723;0.177;0.04799999999999999;-0.034396464646464626;-0.19006283068783067;0.15566636604136605

She mulls it over for a while, talks with her SO, they agree they could use the money, and so finally she says yes.

She slaps him and says, ""what kind of woman do you think I am?""  He replies, ""we have already established what kind of woman you are - we're just haggling over price.""

[21/f] Not sure what to do about my rship due to anxiety that no one else will put up with me;t3_8d9u06;2;"I have been with my boyf for 2 years and 3 months. Recently i have been having thoughts about ending the relationship, however i have pretty bad anxiety and have never broken up with someone. I sometimes feel as if i (maybe always have) loved him as a best friend, or just loved and appreciated that someone actually loved me, and put up with my anxiety for this long, bc other people have gotten sick of me easily it seems. 
Although generally he tries to support me, and i really appreciate it, he is just too relaxed and doesnt understand my anxiety and what i go through with it, or how constant it is. He also will lie. not anything very serious, but something (slighty petty) that he ALWAYS does is always being late, and when i call him to see where he is, he will lie about how long itll take him to get there. As in, he'll actually be 40 minutes away, but tell me on the phone he'll be there in ten minutes. I know its petty but it is a really bad habit that he has and that ive talked to his friends about and they agree how annoying it is. 
Another huge thing: he has a friend, who used to like me romantically. Ever since i started going out with my boyfriend, ive had to hang around with this friend too in their group. The friend always will put me down, say things like ''id break your neck'' to me (because his humour is 'edgy') and when i had a friend commit suicide,  this guy said 'if he hadnt killed himself, id have snapped his neck."" i now refuse to be around this person, but what really really bothers me is that my boyf, his best friend, didnt even say anything to him when he said this shit to me, and when i tell him how much it upsets me, hell at first agree, but still act all pally with this guy. this friend of his is also a compulsive liarand before he knew i was seeing his best friend (my now boyf), told people i tried to have sex with him (bullshit). i have a huge anxiety that if me and my boyfriend did break up, this friend of his would spread lots of shit about meand send me horrible messages.
 I am afraid if we do breakup itll be a mistake, ill have no friends (as i usually hang out with their friend group) and ill never find anyone else who will be able to put up with my anxiety for more than a month :( there are other reasons, like the fact i am very young and dont want to be tied down completely.

Two months ago she went to student exchange. She went pretty far and because I have a lot of responsibilities I just couldn't visit her all this time. 
 
We still talked almost every day and messaged few times a day. I was a bit afraid what might happen, because she has this tendency of “falling in love” (that's her words) with different people very fast. She even admitted things like this happend a few times during our time together. 

On the exchange she had this group of girlfriends and one guy, she was constantly telling me about. But i wasn't worried about the guy, because she told me he didn't attract her physically nor did she feel any special connection to him in any other way. She wanted it purely platonic, even though he would perhaps want more. An I trusted her. 

Then she started to send me shorter responses and even called less. She told me she sometimes doesn't miss me at all. 
Then a few days ago she told me she and her group of friends over and there was this second guy, whom she never mentioned before, with them. She just cassually mentioned him with everybody else. When I asked her who he was, she told me he was in this other group and he just came along. I thought it was weird but since she didn't tell me anything else, I let it go. 

Later I found out she told her brother (they're very close) that she fell in love with him. That she didn't do anything wrong and it will pass, but it's just what she feels. I then found out that everytime the group would go out, they'd end up dancing together and hugging, she'd let her hed slip onto his shoulder etc.
I do trust her that they didn't do anything more (kiss or even make love) but yet just knowing all that crushes me completely. 

She does not yet know that I am aware of this situation and I do not know how to confront her. Also I am supposed to be visiting her in a week and am now totaly confused on what I should do. I've just been crushed so many times and I don't know how much longer can I stand.

When I asked her who he was, she told me he was in this other group and he just came along. I thought it was weird but since she didn't tell me anything else, I let it go. 

Later I found out she told her brother (they're very close) that she fell in love with him. That she didn't do anything wrong and it will pass, but it's just what she feels. I then found out that everytime the group would go out, they'd end up dancing together and hugging, she'd let her hed slip onto his shoulder etc.
I do trust her that they didn't do anything more (kiss or even make love) but yet just knowing all that crushes me completely. 

She does not yet know that I am aware of this situation and I do not know how to confront her. Also I am supposed to be visiting her in a week and am now totaly confused on what I should do. I've just been crushed so many times and I don't know how much longer can I stand.

I don't know your relationship fully however, I would suggest you take a step back and really decide if this is good for you overall mental wellbeing. People who really love each other grow stronger through distance, not fall in love with someone else. You should focus on yourself for now and do whats best for you and only you. I know you love her and I know it hurts but time heals all wounds and you will find someone who will equally appreciate your love.;2;1.0;[[0.96753092]];[[0.52132497]];0.9570000000000001;0.09;0.866;0.044000000000000004;0.9690000000000001;0.235;0.7340000000000001;0.031;-0.15799999999999995;0.0781878306878307;0.2267857142857143;-0.1485978835978836
I [26m] feel crushed by my girlfriend's[24f] actions and feelings.;t3_8cxql5;3;"I'll try to keep it short. Me and my girlfriend have benn together for almost 6 years. We were really enjoying our life together. Ofcourse with occasional ups and downs. 
Two months ago she went to student exchange. She went pretty far and because I have a lot of responsibilities I just couldn't visit her all this time. 
 
We still talked almost every day and messaged few times a day. I was a bit afraid what might happen, because she has this tendency of “falling in love” (that's her words) with different people very fast. She even admitted things like this happend a few times during our time together. 

On the exchange she had this group of girlfriends and one guy, she was constantly telling me about. But i wasn't worried about the guy, because she told me he didn't attract her physically nor did she feel any special connection to him in any other way. She wanted it purely platonic, even though he would perhaps want more. An I trusted her.

I have a boyfriend and I gave my number to a guy because I wanted the awkward interaction to stop. How can I get myself out of this sticky situation?;t3_8cwdi1;7;"I [22/F] have been dating my boyfriend [22/M] for what’s about to be 4 years in a couple of days. We haven’t had the best relationship until I moved out of my toxic household. Since I moved things between us have been amazing. I wouldn’t say he is the jealous type, but sometimes when it comes to guys talking to me he can be a little jealous. Now he doesn’t tell me who I can and can’t talk to. I have male friends and he knows them. Something about me I feel it is important to know is that i can be too nice for my own benefit, I hate being in awkward situations. I am a huge introvert and when it comes to the gym I can’t even ask a person how many sets they have left so I’m just standing in the back of the gym just waiting for a bench or rack to open up. 

We both workout, him more than me. Yesterday at the gym while at the squat rack I was resting before starting my set. I was looking at the music video up on the tv that was to my slight right in front of me when I notice an individual just kinda looking at me. (Now let me make note that the squat racks at the gym face each other). I turn and he starts talking to me. I take one ear bud out and he asks if he can take the 25lbs. I said sure and put the earbud back in. I do my set and then I rest. Every time I rest he looks at me and waits for the time to talk. We proceeded to talk about my major and he asks if I do cross fit (I was doing front squats) I tell him that I do track and these are one of the workouts we do. He then says that he is a coach and if I ever need anything he can help. I tell him thanks but that I’m okay that my boyfriend usually helps me out. He then mentions that he is from San Diego and doesn’t really know the area. I’m trying to be polite but I’m really trying to avoid having to talk to him any more than what I have to. I wasn’t really in gaging in the conversation. I was awkward and kept my answers short and blunt. So I start to just do my set when he finishes his to avoid having to talk to him. As I’m thinking about finishing my front squats he then asks about what trails I do. I tell him running on the street is cool. And he then asks for my number just to know what trails he should do. I pause and say “uhh” and I’m looking around. He then acknowledges the fact that I’m not to keen on it and he says “I know you’re a little unsure “ and laughs. I begin to feel awkward and I don’t want to seem rude or bitchy. I’ve never been in this situation so to just get him away I give him my number. Big mistake I know!!

So I decide to go to my boyfriends house and we go run, we have been running together and I should have told him then and there but I hate awkward situations and we were having such a good time I didn’t want to ruin anything. I leave go home. Time goes by and the whole situation eats at me. So I tell my boyfriend and rightfully so he is very upset with me. Especially more so because i waited so long to tell him even after we went running together.  He mentions that I should have called him or said something. The thing is I have no intentions with the guy at the gym the second I gave him my number i regretted it . I even hate it more than i didn’t give him a fake one! I would be upset with my boyfriend if he did that too. I’m just very upset with the whole thing. 

The guy texted me and I want to tell him that he should just delete my number. I want to remind him I have a boyfriend and that I was just trying to be friendly but I shouldn’t have given him my number. How can I resolve this? How can I avoid this from happening again!?

You've been with your bf for four years, say your sorry, remind him you're awkward af in these situations, and tell him you're working on how to shut people down.

Or just block him, and tell him (loudly enough for the gym staff to hear) that you're not interested in a trainer or a friendship or whatever it is he's looking for, and he needs to leave you alone and let you finish your workout in peace if he confronts you about it in person.

I have a boyfriend and I gave my number to a guy because I wanted the awkward interaction to stop. How can I get myself out of this sticky situation?;t3_8cwdi1;7;"I [22/F] have been dating my boyfriend [22/M] for what’s about to be 4 years in a couple of days. We haven’t had the best relationship until I moved out of my toxic household. Since I moved things between us have been amazing. I wouldn’t say he is the jealous type, but sometimes when it comes to guys talking to me he can be a little jealous. Now he doesn’t tell me who I can and can’t talk to. I have male friends and he knows them. Something about me I feel it is important to know is that i can be too nice for my own benefit, I hate being in awkward situations. I am a huge introvert and when it comes to the gym I can’t even ask a person how many sets they have left so I’m just standing in the back of the gym just waiting for a bench or rack to open up. 

We both workout, him more than me. Yesterday at the gym while at the squat rack I was resting before starting my set. I was looking at the music video up on the tv that was to my slight right in front of me when I notice an individual just kinda looking at me. (Now let me make note that the squat racks at the gym face each other). I turn and he starts talking to me. I take one ear bud out and he asks if he can take the 25lbs. I said sure and put the earbud back in. I do my set and then I rest. Every time I rest he looks at me and waits for the time to talk. We proceeded to talk about my major and he asks if I do cross fit (I was doing front squats) I tell him that I do track and these are one of the workouts we do. He then says that he is a coach and if I ever need anything he can help. I tell him thanks but that I’m okay that my boyfriend usually helps me out. He then mentions that he is from San Diego and doesn’t really know the area. I’m trying to be polite but I’m really trying to avoid having to talk to him any more than what I have to. I wasn’t really in gaging in the conversation. I was awkward and kept my answers short and blunt. So I start to just do my set when he finishes his to avoid having to talk to him. As I’m thinking about finishing my front squats he then asks about what trails I do. I tell him running on the street is cool. And he then asks for my number just to know what trails he should do. I pause and say “uhh” and I’m looking around. He then acknowledges the fact that I’m not to keen on it and he says “I know you’re a little unsure “ and laughs. I begin to feel awkward and I don’t want to seem rude or bitchy. I’ve never been in this situation so to just get him away I give him my number. Big mistake I know!!

So I decide to go to my boyfriends house and we go run, we have been running together and I should have told him then and there but I hate awkward situations and we were having such a good time I didn’t want to ruin anything. I leave go home. Time goes by and the whole situation eats at me. So I tell my boyfriend and rightfully so he is very upset with me. Especially more so because i waited so long to tell him even after we went running together.  He mentions that I should have called him or said something. The thing is I have no intentions with the guy at the gym the second I gave him my number i regretted it . I even hate it more than i didn’t give him a fake one! I would be upset with my boyfriend if he did that too. I’m just very upset with the whole thing. 

The guy texted me and I want to tell him that he should just delete my number. I want to remind him I have a boyfriend and that I was just trying to be friendly but I shouldn’t have given him my number. How can I resolve this? How can I avoid this from happening again!?

I have issues regarding my gay relationship;t3_8cql5v;2;"Me and my partner have been together for almost 4 months, and we live in a conservative country where you could be put to death if you were caught 'doing the act' or just being gay in general, and it really has been hard for us.
We are now in high school and still a year is left, and we plan moving together when we reach the age of 18 by studying abroad together. 

The first 2 months of our relationship was amazing, like the best 2 months of my life and I really am glad that this person is my partner and I really want to spend the rest of my life with him, and he also does feel the same way about me.

But then came these past two months, and I noticed something, we were occasionally fighting every now and then and we really tried figuring it out but everytime we do ""figure it out"" we eventually find ourselves fighting over dumb shit, sometimes our fights don't even make sense anymore.

Anyhow, I noticed that the most time we went through without fighting was about two weeks, and it really saddens me, I really love him so much and I want things to really work out between us, but I don't know what to do anymore.
";2;"if you live in a conservative country, then best protect yourself until you have the resources to move to a more accepting region of the world. You're not even 18 yet so there is a lot ahead of you and at the same time a lot is at stake. I do not question that you feel strongly about this guy but to think you will spend the rest of your life with him is a little naive. Relationships change over time, so after the initial infatuation is gone, it's expected that there will be disagreements and arguments. My advice is take things slowly, step back a little bit, and focus on your studies, stay friends and support each other. You are still children and have yet to enter adulthood. Once you see things from that perspective you can decide if you will move on with your relationship or go separate ways, but right now a relationship like this puts both your lives in danger. If you are going to argue about small trivial things, you may draw unwanted attention from people that can report you to authorities.

"[17/m] Needed to ""talk"" this out in some way";t3_8ctscp;3;"I made a previous post on my predicament. A sort of conclusion played out which kinda means nothing I guess but I'll explain how I went through it. A good friend of mine broke up with Girl Friend or at least intends to first thing in the morning. He's kinda broken up about it and the break up and mainly due to her parents. The situation is kinda screwed and set in stone so I just spend about 30 minutes just listening to him let out whats going on in head. We talk for a bit and I offer to give him a call later. I'm on the robotics team at my high school and after the call ends I go back to it. A few hours pass and it's 7 PM. I get a call from my friend and he asks me to go to movies. To note it's 7 PM on a Monday night and we have class tmmrw. My first reaction is no, but I decide to go with it. He told me that he asked a few others, but I'm guessing they all the same response I had initially. My robotics shiz finishes up around 9 and i go see some b tier horror movie with this guy. On the ride over we joke a bit and I attempt to keep his mind off the situation with his girl. In his venting I kinda sympathize with a couple of his statements and I lose my chill demeanor and vent a bit as well. It boils down to two bro's just joking about out his unfortunate situation and my innate ability to friend zone myself from my girlfriend. (To make a long story short my gf an I have hugged once within the past 5 months and that was on her birthday, so that should give you an idea of how it's going)


Anyways I cut myself off, not really wanting to bitch and moan when my friend is going through real stuff. He kinda pushes and decides to text my gf and basically say ""Hey Anon doesn't want to say anything but he's kinda insecure about the fact that you guys haven't done anything"". I play along, because its a thing that keeps my friends mind off of his girlfriend and situation. She texts back ""We don't really have time to do anything(Which is fair and probably true. She does Drama and I do an assortment of STEM activities killing most of time), but we will get to it later"" My buddy says it's fine, but being the paranoid dick I am, I assume it's some sort of dodge and that she really isn't interested in doing anything. (Which from the outside reading that I am probably just being paranoid but this has been going on for 5 months)

Anyways we watching this movie and the only thing going through my head is how idiotic I am and how I've been acting for the past 5 months. I basically berate myself for 2 hours and come out of this movie feeling like nerd who is destine to have more contact with a keyboard this another human being. And don't get me wrong I'm definitly a nerd, geek, or whatever the classification is. I spend about half my time taking about computers and putting them back together, and the other half either trying to build a robot or trying to pick up C++ instead of doing classwork or homework. 

That with quite a few more harsh words on my personality and my inability to do shit when it comes to people have been rolling through my head when we leave, but I work through because comparatively my issues are with myself most likely anyways.  I kinda feign a happy jokey persona for next half hour ish with the guy and try to double down that you go through bad spots, but it's important to focus on the good times (And other mopey happy shiz), basically whatever to keep this guy not depressed about his situation.  I think the hanging out helped or hopefully made his day or softens the terrible situation he was in. 

I went home and ended up punching a wall out of frustration fucking up my knuckles, which adds to the fun of the night I guess. And about 10 minutes after having some sort of physiological breakdown I'm writing this. A good 99% of me feels terrible about all of this because it compounds on itself. I shouldn't expect so much from a girl who literally as busy as I am, I shouldn't bitch and complain about my little personality and prob mental defect when some guy lost the love of his life due to some abusive parents, I shouldn't (whether I intended to or not) use another person to talk shit out with gf, I shouldn't feel this bad, I should be better, and I shouldn't write any of this shit. A normal functioning human being doesn't go through this shit and I wouldn't call myself that. 

I almost hunger for some sort of physical or hell emotional connection to people because as a child I dealt with a mother who had an AVM. For those who don't know what that is it'a brain tumor that kills 1 in 300,000,000 people. So like 23 ppl in the whole world. Anyways it degrades the person over time making them go insane. Parents were split at the time and 6 year old me lived with a woman losing her sanity. I'm sure nothing went wrong with that. Lived with a Dad from 7 to now who did his best to raise his son, but that father dealt with some other shit from a even shittier childhood, leading to some unintended verbal abuse earlier in my childhood. That shit all faded and I love my dad, but some things will never fade from my memory. On that peachy note you have a kid who grows up trying to make everyone he knows laugh or at the least happy because all I could do for awhile was shrug my shoulders and just smile. Fast forward a decade and you have a kid who needs to keep those he cares about happy, but someone who can't rationalize or open up to anyone. A few friends have made comments to my gf about how I feel an I play it off, lie, bs, or do whatever to mask what is going on in my head. 

Idk what else is wrong with me, but writing this is the alternative to punching more walls so HERE IT IS. Feel free to disregard and help people who need/deserve it. This whole relationship thing doesn't work out for people like me.";2;"I can understand your perspective, although I'm sorry you had to deal with the loss of a parent. My mother is alive, but after my parents divorced when I was 10 I was raised by my father and dealt with verbal/physical abuse. We get along fine now, but I'm a bit more cynical than you turned out. 

Congratulations on getting your feelings written out though. That's an important thing. I'm hopeful you recognize at some point that you need to take care of yourself, and not just others. That's something I had a problem doing.";2;1.0;[[0.96663859]];[[0.53987372]];-0.9853;0.13;0.7190000000000001;0.151;0.5439;0.17300000000000001;0.685;0.142;-0.05199999999999999;0.02494774477447745;0.052777777777777785;-0.02783003300330033

A good friend of mine broke up with Girl Friend or at least intends to first thing in the morning. He's kinda broken up about it and the break up and mainly due to her parents. The situation is kinda screwed and set in stone so I just spend about 30 minutes just listening to him let out whats going on in head. We talk for a bit and I offer to give him a call later. I'm on the robotics team at my high school and after the call ends I go back to it. A few hours pass and it's 7 PM. I get a call from my friend and he asks me to go to movies. To note it's 7 PM on a Monday night and we have class tmmrw. My first reaction is no, but I decide to go with it. He told me that he asked a few others, but I'm guessing they all the same response I had initially. My robotics shiz finishes up around 9 and i go see some b tier horror movie with this guy. On the ride over we joke a bit and I attempt to keep his mind off the situation with his girl. In his venting I kinda sympathize with a couple of his statements and I lose my chill demeanor and vent a bit as well. It boils down to two bro's just joking about out his unfortunate situation and my innate ability to friend zone myself from my girlfriend. (To make a long story short my gf an I have hugged once within the past 5 months and that was on her birthday, so that should give you an idea of how it's going)


Anyways I cut myself off, not really wanting to bitch and moan when my friend is going through real stuff. He kinda pushes and decides to text my gf and basically say ""Hey Anon doesn't want to say anything but he's kinda insecure about the fact that you guys haven't done anything"". I play along, because its a thing that keeps my friends mind off of his girlfriend and situation. She texts back ""We don't really have time to do anything(Which is fair and probably true. She does Drama and I do an assortment of STEM activities killing most of time), but we will get to it later"" My buddy says it's fine, but being the paranoid dick I am, I assume it's some sort of dodge and that she really isn't interested in doing anything. (Which from the outside reading that I am probably just being paranoid but this has been going on for 5 months)

Anyways we watching this movie and the only thing going through my head is how idiotic I am and how I've been acting for the past 5 months. I basically berate myself for 2 hours and come out of this movie feeling like nerd who is destine to have more contact with a keyboard this another human being. And don't get me wrong I'm definitly a nerd, geek, or whatever the classification is. I spend about half my time taking about computers and putting them back together, and the other half either trying to build a robot or trying to pick up C++ instead of doing classwork or homework. 

That with quite a few more harsh words on my personality and my inability to do shit when it comes to people have been rolling through my head when we leave, but I work through because comparatively my issues are with myself most likely anyways.  I kinda feign a happy jokey persona for next half hour ish with the guy and try to double down that you go through bad spots, but it's important to focus on the good times (And other mopey happy shiz), basically whatever to keep this guy not depressed about his situation.  I think the hanging out helped or hopefully made his day or softens the terrible situation he was in. 

I went home and ended up punching a wall out of frustration fucking up my knuckles, which adds to the fun of the night I guess. And about 10 minutes after having some sort of physiological breakdown I'm writing this. A good 99% of me feels terrible about all of this because it compounds on itself. I shouldn't expect so much from a girl who literally as busy as I am, I shouldn't bitch and complain about my little personality and prob mental defect when some guy lost the love of his life due to some abusive parents, I shouldn't (whether I intended to or not) use another person to talk shit out with gf, I shouldn't feel this bad, I should be better, and I shouldn't write any of this shit. A normal functioning human being doesn't go through this shit and I wouldn't call myself that. 

I almost hunger for some sort of physical or hell emotional connection to people because as a child I dealt with a mother who had an AVM. For those who don't know what that is it'a brain tumor that kills 1 in 300,000,000 people. So like 23 ppl in the whole world. Anyways it degrades the person over time making them go insane. Parents were split at the time and 6 year old me lived with a woman losing her sanity. I'm sure nothing went wrong with that. Lived with a Dad from 7 to now who did his best to raise his son, but that father dealt with some other shit from a even shittier childhood, leading to some unintended verbal abuse earlier in my childhood. That shit all faded and I love my dad, but some things will never fade from my memory. On that peachy note you have a kid who grows up trying to make everyone he knows laugh or at the least happy because all I could do for awhile was shrug my shoulders and just smile. Fast forward a decade and you have a kid who needs to keep those he cares about happy, but someone who can't rationalize or open up to anyone. A few friends have made comments to my gf about how I feel an I play it off, lie, bs, or do whatever to mask what is going on in my head. 

Idk what else is wrong with me, but writing this is the alternative to punching more walls so HERE IT IS. Feel free to disregard and help people who need/deserve it. This whole relationship thing doesn't work out for people like me.";2;"If anyone can read or understand what I'm saying props to you. It looks about as organized as atmospheric readings.

I think i love this girl but I want to end it;t3_8d3z7j;2;"Writing this on mobile, sorry about the formatting.

Edit: I’m M/19 she’s F/18

I met this girl through tinder roughly 3 months ago. Over those 3 months, her and I have grown very close. Although we live about 3 hours apart (I’m at college but we’re both from the same city), we’ve been texting, snap chatting, and facetiming every day. I’ve told her things I’ve never even told my fraternity brothers, she’s told me things she’s never told anyone else. We both find each other very attractive, and we have really compatible personalities. She gets me, all my bad jokes and quirks, and I get her as well. I really think I love this girl. And although she hasn’t used the “L” word, I think she shares those strong feelings as well.

Lately she expressed that she still likes me a lot but doesn’t want to date. I’ll be home for the summer soon and i always thought her and I would begin a serious relationship. However, she doesn’t want a distance relationship because she really needs affection and intimacy in a relationship, which I understand. Additionally, she doesn’t want to start dating over the summer and then leave for college in the fall, for the same reason.

I assumed that if we both really liked each other, distance wouldn’t matter as much; I know I would be more than happy to maintain a LDR if it meant her and I were together. Lately I’ve been really doubting if I can just stay friends with this girl; it’s hard to love someone like that and know you’ll never be their exclusive companion.

She’s had a lot of past issues with bullying and self-doubt. Not a lot of friends, either. She’s told me many times that I’m her closest friend, and the only one she can confide in and with which she can relate.

Here is my dilemma: I have a strong sense that things won’t work out between us, and I feel like I’m doing myself a disservice by trying to suffer through “just friends”. I would rather just end it, take the pain, and move on. But if I end things completely, I take away her only close friend; I don’t know if I can live with that.

I’ve never had this mutual affection before (I’m 19, she’s only the second girl I’ve ever kissed. I know, I’m a loser it’s cool). I don’t know if I can give that up but I know if I keep holding onto a false hope, it will hurt me equally as bad.";1;"Some of these feelings are probably because she's the first person you've really connected with like this, but it is hard to loose one's best friend.  

Firstly, don't stay her friend to stop her feelings from being hurt.  She's the one who's essentially breaking up with you. 

Second, you may very well want to be friends, but usually it request some time between something serious/sexual to something that is totally platonic.  Imagine, for example, if she was telling you about her new boyfriend.  Would you be happy for her or totally beside yourself with emotion?   Tell her you will miss her dearly, that you would love to see if you could both be friends, but that you need a break so that you can restart a friendship down the track.  Then give yourself a year or so without seeing her before saying hello again and see what happens. 

Life is like that sometimes.... so really easy answers..";2;2.0;[[0.97886006]];[[0.66717294]];0.9948;0.195;0.7120000000000001;0.09300000000000001;0.9934;0.27399999999999997;0.6579999999999999;0.068;-0.104;0.08282145782145785;0.17620892179715705;-0.0933874639756992

I’m in hospital and boyfriend doesn’t want to see me!;t3_8d515u;7;"Ok, so last night 7pm I (27/F) ended up in excruciating pain whilst out with my kids, it was soo bad I managed to get to A&amp;E and was admitted. My bf  (28) not long finished work and went back to his place (roughly 1.5hrs away) during this time I’ve explained how much I’m struggling alone, need help with kids and support and all he would say is sorry....
So I sent him my location and explained that It’d be nice if he came. By this point it’s 10pm and he says no it’s too late. 

Fast forward to this morning- I call him and he’s acting normal, then says he’s off to uni to get books for his next assignment. At this point I’m baffled and ask him if he’s coming to see me and he awkwardly says yes.....

I literally just came off the phone with him after realising that he’s coming down today (uni) and tomorrow to see his kid, so I make a suggestion that he stay at mine tonight, that way he could give me a hand and save money by already being in the area (kid doesn’t live far from me) 

And he says no!....he has his assignment to do...
So I make a suggestion that he could do it at mine, my kids are pretty good and don’t really cause much of a fuss. Again he says NO!

Am I wrong for feeling upset by this? I’m in hospital on my own, with no visitors and my own boyfriend doesn’t jump to see me after I’ve been admitted! I feel very unsupported right now, I’m here watching everyone here with their visitors and I’m alone crying. :(

I obviously can’t speak for your bf but it seems I have the same issue your bf has, i.e. having a hard time saying those three words. 

I am in a relationship with someone who has brought up how he needs more reassurance from me on several occasions. I have trouble talking about, and expressing my feelings for him, to him. However, I can easily tell my friends and colleagues about how smitten I am etc. 

He interprets my lack of reassurance as me not being /that/ into him but that’s not the case. I simply feel uncomfortable talking about stuff like that - it makes me cringe. And it’s not just limited to him either, I rarely tell my family I love them, or my friends. 

My boyfriend brings this flaw up quite regularly with me and tries to get me to talk about how I feel about him but I can’t/won’t. It’s just not me. It makes me extremely uncomfortable unless I’m under the influence of MDMA. I know I love him, but I think I can count how many times I’ve told him on one hand. However, I show my feelings to him in ways that aren’t speaking. I show it to him by spending the majority of my spare time with him, or by doing him little favours I wouldn’t do for others, or by letting him have the last piece of chocolate even though I wanted it.  At the end of the day, actions speak louder than words, so maybe all you need to do is open your eyes to feel the love you’re craving. 

If I were you, I’d try to be a little bit more understanding and maybe self reflect into why it’s so important for you to hear those words.

It’s likely that he’s completed his education, that he’s in a career path that he enjoys, and that he’s beginning to think about his goals for the rest of his life, which may include things like marriage, a family, travel, etc. At 17, you likely haven’t finished your education, you do not have a career, and you’re still young enough not to be sure what you want in your life (or if you believe you do, it’s possible that this could drastically change with the next 5 years or so). It’s doubtful, based on the age gap, that you have much in common or that you have any shared life experiences. You may share interests (such as cooking or TV shows), but you also share those interests with a large number of people in your own peer group, as does he. The fact that he, at 35, is choosing to pursue a romantic relationship with a 17 year old does not, objectively, reflect well on his intentions or his character. ;5;5.0;[[0.95600747]];[[0.62671565]];0.9884;0.221;0.762;0.017;0.8945;0.107;0.8640000000000001;0.028999999999999998;0.126;0.2588666666666667;0.02589285714285714;0.2329738095238096

 (English is not my first language)";1;"The biggest problem is you don't even have the life experience enough to know the dangers. 
How do you evaluate this when you don't really understand the problem or concerns?

Depending on your personality, you will think these things don't apply. That you know. 
But your brain is still developing even now. You barely had any relationships. Of course this seems great. You have had almost nothing normal to compare it to. 

The best comparison is think about an 10 year old child and their mental experiences. You have that equavilent to the guy you are dating. 
Could you mentally connect with a ten year old and think they understand the world? Yet ask them and they don't know, that they don't understand anything yet.

I'm [27m] is in love with [31f] FWB;t3_8cvoq7;4;"I tried posting it last week but then deleted everything, but here I am once again seeking your advice.

I’m 27 years old guy, super active, regular at gym, had a perfect work and life routine, been saving myself for the right person on right time and was not into premarital coitus for religious reasons until recently when I happen to move into an apartment with two stranger females I found over internet to share apartment rent expenses. 
Overall both nice ladies and turned out one of them who is 31 year old is jobless and struggling to find a job. She is good looking, nice and was helping me with cooking and stuff at the apartment so I started helping her too in finding her a job.  Eventually we both got attracted to each other made out several times and almost got involved in the act which I have been avoiding all my life.

Here’s the turning point: Later she told me that she is into clubbing and all stuff and been dating many guys at the moment (that I can tell from looking down there), so I made it clear to her that if so then we can be friends with benefits (FWB). She and I both agreed. But since we met she didn’t go clubbing or dating and spent all her time with me as I kept on helping her in finding a job she would take care of my everyday stuff and would even cook for me daily. We both lived like a family.  

Now all of a sudden one of her ex who she truly loved (she told me about him and he’s married) comes in town and she is gone like I did not exist for her. She once in a while texts me and says she misses me but she is spending all her day and night with her ex. She calls me that she will come to see me but she won’t. She said she would come and live again after her ex is gone out of town after a week or so.

I feel like I got attached with her and developed feelings for her. I miss her badly my routine has suffered I would eat randomly, stopped going to gym and even took off from work.

Last night I got angry and texted her not to come back and go away from my life,  instead of fighting she replies that she would come see me and she misses me too.  

I have been into a relationship once and it took me long to get over it..  I’m an emotional guy and this is also one of the reasons for not getting into relationship for over past 5 years.  
But here I am getting attached and emotional and hurt once again. 


TL;DR  Got attached to my FWB and roommate now she is back with her ex for a while because we are only FWBs and I cannot do anything to get her back also  will not be able get over the fact the she was dating her ex  while being with me.

English is not my first language so please ignore my mistakes, 

Please advise or let me know what do you think of my situation.

Update : Thank you guys for your opinions, means a lot to me at this moment. 

Here's what happened last night after i told her that it's over. 
She showed up for sometime and i let my anger out on her, then we made out and she left with her ex ofcourse. 

Here's what i've decided, i' will not have feelings for her and will have fun as long she is having and nothing serious should be there.

2. Obsessed with married ex and it's apparently having an affair with him?

She sounds like she's a mess. She might be a good person I guess but if she's spending that much time with a married man they aren't just friends. Is this the kind of person you really want to be with?

I’m 27 years old guy, super active, regular at gym, had a perfect work and life routine, been saving myself for the right person on right time and was not into premarital coitus for religious reasons until recently when I happen to move into an apartment with two stranger females I found over internet to share apartment rent expenses. 
Overall both nice ladies and turned out one of them who is 31 year old is jobless and struggling to find a job. She is good looking, nice and was helping me with cooking and stuff at the apartment so I started helping her too in finding her a job.  Eventually we both got attracted to each other made out several times and almost got involved in the act which I have been avoiding all my life.

Here’s the turning point: Later she told me that she is into clubbing and all stuff and been dating many guys at the moment (that I can tell from looking down there), so I made it clear to her that if so then we can be friends with benefits (FWB). She and I both agreed. But since we met she didn’t go clubbing or dating and spent all her time with me as I kept on helping her in finding a job she would take care of my everyday stuff and would even cook for me daily. We both lived like a family.  

Now all of a sudden one of her ex who she truly loved (she told me about him and he’s married) comes in town and she is gone like I did not exist for her. She once in a while texts me and says she misses me but she is spending all her day and night with her ex. She calls me that she will come to see me but she won’t. She said she would come and live again after her ex is gone out of town after a week or so.

I feel like I got attached with her and developed feelings for her. I miss her badly my routine has suffered I would eat randomly, stopped going to gym and even took off from work.

Last night I got angry and texted her not to come back and go away from my life,  instead of fighting she replies that she would come see me and she misses me too.  

I have been into a relationship once and it took me long to get over it..  I’m an emotional guy and this is also one of the reasons for not getting into relationship for over past 5 years.  
But here I am getting attached and emotional and hurt once again. 


TL;DR  Got attached to my FWB and roommate now she is back with her ex for a while because we are only FWBs and I cannot do anything to get her back also  will not be able get over the fact the she was dating her ex  while being with me.

English is not my first language so please ignore my mistakes, 

Please advise or let me know what do you think of my situation.

Update : Thank you guys for your opinions, means a lot to me at this moment. 

Here's what happened last night after i told her that it's over. 
She showed up for sometime and i let my anger out on her, then we made out and she left with her ex ofcourse. 

Here's what i've decided, i' will not have feelings for her and will have fun as long she is having and nothing serious should be there. I told her i can't be serious with you coz i don't trust that you'd stay with one guy so let's keep having fun together and after a while i go my way you go your way.  

What do you guys think?";4;"She is keeping you on a string because she is scared to be alone. If she wanted to be your partner, she would already **be** your partner—there was nothing stopping her from falling for you and everything in the world making it likely and easy. 

She doesn’t love you. If she said she did, she was dishonest. She likes having you around because she needs to have a lot of men available. There’s a hole in her self esteem that you can’t fill. I’m sorry she’s so broken, that’s hard and lonesome for her, but your best bet is to disentangle yourself as soon as possible.

What do you guys think?";4;"I've been in very similar situations. A few years ago, I dated a girl who was still seeing another guy. We had amazing chemistry and it went on for several months. We worked together and saw each other frequently. 

I begged her to break up with him. She always refused. 

Eventually, I ended it. I told myself she wasn't a worthwhile pursuit. It wasn't easy, but now I'm with someone else who actually wants to build a life with me. 

If you chase this girl, do it because it's fun. Not because you're looking for a companion.

I need serious advice on an ‘inappropriate’ age gap of a teen girl and a young man;t3_8d3asl;8;Hey, so I don’t know if anyone will ever read this but I need some advice! I’m a teen girl in high school and through out the whole last this young man, a 20 year old and I, a 16 year old, have been trapped in such a cruel Romeo and Juliet situation I just don’t know what to do. Now before you judge me saying I don’t know love and that he’s using me. He’s not I promise, and I’m not a love expert but all I know is we have this deep connection that’s beyond skin deep and others opinions. He lives pretty close by and we met cause we bumped into each other literally and started to chat. I was heading to my friends apartment.. he lives in the same building. We talked for a few minutes I gave him my number, I mean he’s only 20 and to he completely honestly I thought he might only be 18 and he was thinking I was 18 even though we never mentioned age. Pretty much we started to see each other around a lot cause I was over at her place a lot and we grew more and more infatuated. We finally went out on a date and we very soon realized that we miss calculated each other’s ages by a mile. It was awkward, he initiated the idea that we shouldn’t talk anymore and I was heart broken like I honestly wanted to get to know this guy and thought he was really amazing. We snuck around a few times, but at the end of the day he’d always somehow remember what we’re doing it ‘wrong’ and then the heart break would start all over again. We’ve gone out of our ways to try to make this work, but we live in a world that won’t except us for our love even if it is true. So I’m forced to respect the law it’s not like I want him to get into any trouble. I feel so lost like I know we both care A LOT for each other and everything but laws and stuff say that it’s illegal. What do I do guys?;2;If things work out, age will matter a lot less the older you guys get. Depending on where you live, maybe just lay low until you’re of age (whatever that may be), but a four year age gap doesn’t mean a whole lot especially once you’re passed 17 or 18 - so hang in there!

But you guys have to compromise on the sex part.hold off having sex till you re 18 or close. That way the guy feels a lot less guilty. And you don’t put him into any real trouble.

I [24/M] need help easing my girlfriend’s [21/F] nerves about intimacy;t3_8daczn;2;"First off, some backstory: I’m a pretty big anomaly when it comes to men my age. I’ve never been in a relationship before, never had sex, and never even made out with a girl before (well, sober at least…and even drunk, only once). We’ve been together for about two months now and things have been going really well. So much so that the topic of sex has regularly come up in conversation lately. Problem is, I recently revealed my inexperience with women to her (in the interest of putting everything on the table…and covering my ass in case my performance wasn’t top-notch). 

While she appreciated my honesty (and took comfort knowing that I didn’t sleep around), what I didn’t expect was the revelation that she actually would have preferred I not tell her, because now she feels added pressure about everything. Since I’ve never made out with someone before, she says she’s nervous for when we do it because if it goes poorly, she’ll know (whereas I probably won’t have a clue) and she’ll want to tell me it wasn’t so good, but she also doesn’t want to hurt my feelings. The same goes for sex, but times 10. Since the next time will be my first time, she says she’s nervous and feels added pressure to make it memorable, while also not wanting to critique too much or hurt my feelings. What’s most confusing to me is she says that, above almost everything else, she’s more nervous for me.

I’ve done my best to reassure her several times by letting her know that she has nothing to be nervous about (unlike me), but it doesn’t seem to be working. Any advice (particularly from women) on how to make her feel better/more at ease?

TL;DR: girlfriend’s nervous (for me and because of me) about being intimate because I’m a virgin who’s also never made out with a girl.";1;Honestly I’d tell her that there’s nothing to worry about. If it’s something you both want, especially you, then what do you two have to lose? Being intimate isn’t about showing off your skills and whatnot but just about being close to one another.

First of all, wtf. I have been no contact with Tom for 3-4 months (since my brother died and Tom went Ape shit on me). I'm not pregnant.

Tom is really close to this cousin...well everyone is close to each other in his family so I don't know why he had to message me through instagram for Tom's number.

Tom's best friend also messaged my sister two days ago,  stating he was living at my ex's and I's old apartment and he enjoys being in a new city. My sister didn't respond.

I(26/f) broke up with my ex fiance (31/m) 6 months ago and this is the message I get from his on instagram cousin(26/m);t3_8ctzgu;13;"Message I get from his cousin on instagram. Sorry for the typo

Message = "" Hey, my parents told me you and Tom were going to have a baby due in December. congratulations. Tell Tom to call me I don't have his new number.""


First of all, wtf. I have been no contact with Tom for 3-4 months (since my brother died and Tom went Ape shit on me). I'm not pregnant. And I'm also deeply offended because I had miscarriage with Tom two years ago. Tom is really close to this cousin...well everyone is close to each other in his family so I don't know why he had to message me through instagram for Tom's number. Everyone is blocked on instagram and phone. I never engaged too much with cousin and forgot to block him. I haven't responded and don't know what to say. Tom's best friend also messaged my sister two days ago,  stating he was living at my ex's and I's old apartment and he enjoys being in a new city. My sister didn't respond. 

My break up with Tom was ugly. He was an emotionally and verbal abusive porn addict. I am trying to grieve my brother who passed away very young and recently. I am trying to give all my positive energy into the universe and I just feel like Tom is trying to find ways back into my life. What do I do. ";41;He's trying to bait you.

I [18F] am having trouble with my boyfriend's [22M] introversion;t3_8clp55;5;"Hey Reddit! 

My boyfriend and I have been together for four months but were best friends for about 4 years before that (like to the point where we knew each other's families VERY well and spent thanksgiving/christmas together). We've had a lot of adjustments to make in our relationship and have been seeing each other a LOT more as a result of me recently getting out of an abusive household and him moving out of his parents' house. 

Because I knew him well before we started dating, I was expecting some tension between the two of us was going to arise because of how introverted he is and how extroverted I am. We're literally on opposite ends of the spectrum. I didn't, however, expect him to not be able to spend more than a day or two with me without shutting down entirely and being at (in his words) ""the end of [his] rope"" after not even the full weekend. He won't kiss me, he won't hold my hand, sit next to me on the couch, or even get into bed with me after a certain length of time (like I said usually after one night, two if he's feeling really good that weekend). I've even offered to sleep on the couch and give him space during the day but he says that just my being there is enough to drain him. He insists it isn't just me but everybody, and when I mentioned his two roommates he said that they don't count, they live with him and it's different because I'm a ""guest"", which I don't understand.

I'm the kind of person who really needs to be with my partner often to feel loved and wanted, and this is killing me. I've loved him for a long time and I don't want to break up with him over something like this. We've talked it out and I've tried to work out compromises with him but he says that it's already incredibly difficult for him to manage the whole weekend. We only see each other on the weekends and never during the week (I live at school during the week and have to be in class) which is shitty, especially considering how relieved he gets as it gets closer and closer to the time when I have to go home. Sometimes he even tells me that he can't wait for Mondays because they're his ""days off"", like I'm some sort of job instead of his girlfriend. 

Anyway, he says he loves me and he loves spending time with me but not in large doses. Like I said I don't want to break up with him because I love him to death and we've been through hell and back but I literally have no idea what I can do to make this work for the both of us.

Speaking from experience, if you drain him, he doesn't feel totally relaxed and comfortable with you.

If you’re at all familiar with Briggs-Meyer personality types, I’m an ENFP and she’s an INTJ. 

She can’t stand being around crowds of more than 3 people, and she’s quiet and shy almost to a fault in public or social setting. Meanwhile I thrive from interaction, conversation and new people and experiences. 
 
However, when we’re together you wouldn’t be able to tell. We’re always chatting, sparring and laughing. If we’re watching something or together, there’s always physical contact/cuddling. She says that she never gets tired of me and begs me to call off work and stay just another night when I leave after a weekend. This is something she didn’t believe possible because she is “annoyed with and/or hates pretty much every person she has ever met” (her words). 

Basically what I’m saying is, maybe this is something more than simple introversion? Because when you find the right person, those barriers should melt away and they become your safe space and your home away from home. 

My gf and I have been together for a little more than a year, and our relationship has pretty much been this way since the start. Do you think this could be something more? I’m not saying you should give up. Rather, dig deeper. Communication is so important, and as the extrovert it falls to us to drive it, more often than not. Cover for his introverted nature by asking the questions and saying the words that he can’t.

The introvert / extrovert categorization isn't the end all, be all of people. It is complicated, but what did you say? About an abusive household?

As an extrovert, could I say that you feel anxious when you want to make sure you are connected to loved ones? COuld I also say that he seems to become ""avoidant"" in your relationship, especially when you reach out over and over again?

I am guessing that neither of you have healthy attachment styles. Whether the introvert/extrovert issue is primary or not is debatable... I mean, it kind of goes hand in hand. 

You want more closeness, communication, etc... He wants less - much less. It is two different reactions to unhealthy attachment styles in your family lives. 

You say you don't want to break up over this. OK. Look into attachment styles and talk it out and see if that is some part of your problem. I feel like if you could both see the truth of attachment styles, you might gain an understanding that really helps your relationship along.

He insists it isn't just me but everybody, and when I mentioned his two roommates he said that they don't count, they live with him and it's different because I'm a ""guest"", which I don't understand.

I'm the kind of person who really needs to be with my partner often to feel loved and wanted, and this is killing me. I've loved him for a long time and I don't want to break up with him over something like this. We've talked it out and I've tried to work out compromises with him but he says that it's already incredibly difficult for him to manage the whole weekend. We only see each other on the weekends and never during the week (I live at school during the week and have to be in class) which is shitty, especially considering how relieved he gets as it gets closer and closer to the time when I have to go home. Sometimes he even tells me that he can't wait for Mondays because they're his ""days off"", like I'm some sort of job instead of his girlfriend. 

Anyway, he says he loves me and he loves spending time with me but not in large doses. Like I said I don't want to break up with him because I love him to death and we've been through hell and back but I literally have no idea what I can do to make this work for the both of us. Does anyone have any advice? I've been thinking couple's therapy but I know he'd think that's a dumb idea since we're both so young and haven't even been together for half a year, but I'm willing to do anything to make this work.";2;This is beyond introversion.

My long distance girlfriend(f) and I(m) of 9 months just found out that her best friend(f) is in madly love with her;t3_8cta0w;2;Title mostly says it all. Best friend isn’t aware that we know. It’s mostly bringing feelings of uncomfortability to both of us. Mostly me though. I am not sure if my feelings are valid or if it is something I am “allowed” to feel uncomfortable about. They are typical best friends they do everything together, and often hang out naked together, kiss each other, and other things that typical girl friends do. This was not a problem for me before, but now that I know best friend is super in love with her, it makes me kind of uncomfortable? It is not a problem of homophobia, don’t be confused, it is a problem of someone thats really in love with my girlfriend getting to see her in those situations now. To me, it is no different than a guy. There is also a factor of me feeling guilty because me and best friend are commonly mean to each other as a joke and now I feel like she truly hates me and I feel bad for joking around. My girlfriend was shocked at first, but now trying to forget about it and act like nothing happened. She was saying “everything makes sense now, she’s always acted that way” and girlfriend told me that best friend has tried to call me out for things I have done and bring me and girlfriend apart. I am having trouble forgetting about it, and feel like its eating away at me. I tell my girlfriend everything I feel and she does the same, we are on the same page. However, are my feelings valid? What is best for me to do at this point? What is best for my girlfriend at this point?;2;Hanging out naked and kissing each other is NOT normal best friend behavior.

How can I [41/M] find my way back to love with my wife [F/42] who has chronic health problems (can't work, heart, pain, and digestive issues)? (6 year relationship);t3_8d34by;7;"My wife and I have been together 6 years. We were both married and divorced before. We dated for 1.5 years, then got married. We felt we were soul mates from the very beginning (though I don't believe each person only has one compatible soul mate, I do believe that there are people with whom we are ""spiritually compatible"".) We had a sense that our souls ""knew each other"", and when we're connected and things are ""good"", I still feel this is true. I feel an amazing and deep connection with her that I've never had with anyone before. I've had about 7 relationships in my life, been married twice before, once a brief and impulsive marriage right out of high school that only lasted a year. The other a sprawling 12 year thing that ended very badly, with someone who I am now fairly certain has serious personality issues.

I had both eyes wide open when I met my (now) current wife, and I was looking for the warning signs I'd tripped up on in my previous relationships... Being impulsive, compromising too much on what I wanted, letting myself become a human doormat (my typical pattern). And the first few years were fantastic. The most amazing experiences I've had with anyone.

But everything has gotten slowly worse over the last three years, as her health issues have mounted and compounded. She started out with a low baseline... When I met her, she was on medication for anxeity and depression, had IBS, Fibromyalgia (chronic pain, chronic fatigue), had already had open heart surgery for a valve replacement, plus chronic migraines. She had good days and bad days, good months and bad months.

But during the first three years or so, the good months outnumbered the bad. I would put her baseline at about 60-70% of normal in terms of energy, quality of life, mood stability, self-responsibility (ability to independently support herself financially and physically).

Over the last three years, things have not gone as well. I feel she has sunk to somewhere around 40% as a new baseline. Over the last three years, her health has declined in three important ways:

1) Her IBS has gotten gradually worse, requiring a strict and complex diet that restricts what she can eat, and forces us to cook mostly from scratch. Going out to eat is possible, but never simple. It is always a complex ""problem solving"" exercise as we research menus in advance and attempt to determine if she will be able to eat anything there. Shopping and meal planning is similarly complicated, and leaves me feeling put-upon much of the time because the cooking usually falls to me, either because she doesn't have the energy, or because she's unwilling to BBQ, or because I'm a bit better at more complex recipes. So there is this food issue in our relationship that is a BIG deal. It creates resentment in both directions, from her, because if I come home from work too tired to cook, she ends up being forced to cook, or eating something she doesn't want out of the freezer. It creates resentment from me, because I feel she expects me to cook when I get home, and she is fairly picky, in addition to needing from-scratch meals most of the time. I am less picky, and happy to eat a smorgasbord of leftovers and freezer items if it means I don't have to cook.

2) She has needed to get a second open heart surgery, which did not go as well. 2 year recover process, with me at her side, very slow and painful. It bought us close, and yet also far apart. She is on blood thinners for life now, requiring an even more restrictive diet, and monthly tests to ensure her levels are right. Her energy is crap - she sleeps 9-10 hours a night, often badly. (She rarely keeps me up though.). She can't work outside the house- her heart issues keep her energy fairly limited. She could probably work a part-time job, but she had medical appointments almost every day that would make it basically impossible to keep a regular schedule, plus she's introverted and it drains her quickly to spend a lot of time outside the house. So she does some private practice telephone work from home (she is a dietitian). But she isn't making any real money -- a few hundred a month at best, and it just builds up in an account where it slowly grows, it doesn't get added to the household income. $3000 accumulated so far, after about a year.

She manages to do the laundry, and usually the shopping. She has a dog and cat from her ""previous life"", which she takes care of (and they are getting old, so they require more care than typical). The dishes fall to me, as does a high pressure job working about 9 hour days and sometimes weekends and evenings to bring in enough money to support us both, pay down our debts, pay her student loan bills, pay the ailing pets with vet bills, pay child support for my daughter from another marriage. I make A LOT of money, and we are starting to finally climb out of the financial hole we were in for several years, but I have given everything I've got to my job in order to make this happen, and I come home exhausted most days after a long commute each direction.

3) Her anxiety and depression have gotten gradually worse - up and down, but a downward trend overall. She is isolated and lonely staying at home all day, though has gotten somewhat better as she has gotten more clients and we have made more friends. That said, she has more bad days than good, often despondent and depressed about her health and how little she's gotten done, or anxious about how much she has to do and how little time and energy she has left to do it. My patience and empathy have begun to wear thin over time, leading to guilt and depression for me as well. I want to be there for her, I want to support her. But I can only hear about the same aches and pains and anxieties and problems so many times before I start to feel futile and frustrated, helpless and angry.

The truth is that I don't really want to leave her. I want her in my life. I love her.

But... I miss her. I don't feel like I get to see her anymore... I don't feel like she is the same person, or like we can inhabit the same space together that we had when we met. The rare times that she feels good enough that we can be happy and at ease together feel farther and farther apart. She has some physical issues that sometimes prevent sex as well, and they have limited our intimacy... Now it is about once a or twice a month that we make love. It used to be 2-3 times a week.

And I can see that it's not her fault.. I do think that her emotional and mental issues exacerbate the problem, but I do see her taking responsibility for them, over and over. She goes to therapy, she goes to doctors appoints and specialists... Most of her health issues are either undiagnoseable or untreatable. It's really a miracle she's alive at all... And I try to be grateful for that, and for the time we get spend together.

Her new heart valves are supposed to last another 20-30 years, which should get us to 60-70 before she dies. She has said she doesn't want another heart surgery because the first two were so awful. Part of me thinks she is a fighter and that she will reconsider when the time comes and she has to choose between death or another heart surgery... Part of me thinks she might actually be ready by then.... That it might actually be best for her not to go under the knife again. Of course, who knows how long we really have together?

Anyone can go at any time - there is never a guarantee for any of us, and I think about that at least once a week now.

Part of me wants to say ""fuck it"" and spend the next few years doing our bucket list together... Except I know we would run out of money very quickly and the end result would not be good. 20-30 years is a long time.

I don't mind supporting her financially. I can make enough money that we can probably get some services to help us out (cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc), after a few more years of working my tail off. 

But I'm afraid it won't actually make her happy. I don't want to spend the next 20-30 years with someone who is miserable 80% of the time because she feels sick and helpless and believes she is just a burden to me (and in some ways, would be).

If she were ""spiritually enlightened"" and able to transcend her pain and be in acceptance around it, and not ask so much of me, then I could probably give a whole lot more. But the more I give, the more she has grown to expect a lot of me, and when I am too tired to deliver (or just don't feel like it), we fight.

Tonight we fought. She wanted me to go shopping, or take her to go out shopping since she couldn't drive because she had taken a pain medication earlier that kept her from driving. And it's not that I couldn't do it...

But I didn't feel like I had a choice about it. I felt like she wasn't really asking me.. She was demanding.

And when I tried to explain, she grew hurt and angry, and retreated to the bedroom.

This is happening more and more often. It's not good. It's not ""us"".

I want ""us"" back... But I don't know how to get it.

";9;"There are quite some things you can do to make this situation more manageable. You say she takes responsibility for her health. So, the meal problem is difficult, but not because ""she"" is being difficult about it. My mom has 20 diagnosed food allergies, so I know how annoying checking menu's can be. I don't take it out on her, I recognize that I only have to check menu's and cook safe, she has to deal with the consequences daily. I rather be on this side!     

So for food, behave like you are in a family of 5. Start meal prepping, cooking in the weekend, freezing save meals for her to have. This way, you both can have 'easy days', where you just grab shit from the freezer and you also don't have to think about what to prepare and how to do it, while overly tired. By planning in the weekend, she can help out, even if it's just by naming recipes or researching what can be done, or chopping up some chicken.    

Second, start cataloguing your own life. It sounds like you are having caregivers fatigue or nearing it. You don't want caregiver burnout. What are you doing for just you? Work, and that's it? Hobby's, outings, friends, decompressing? Start balancing your life.   

Third, for her, she's dealing with the grieving and mourning process of knowing she is doing less and less and able to do less and less. That's super fucked up and depressing. However, she needs to start to find things to occupy her time, cope with what's happening. Find activities that she enjoys that are low energy (reading books, audio books, handicrafts etc.). Then join clubs that do that or host your own circle. Stitch and Bitch baby. This will give her the much needed mental and emotional stimulation.  

Fourth, you need to talk and empathize with each other. The sick partner feels trapped and unable to do things, worthless, waiting in the wings until the healthy partner is home and they can finally ""do"" something. The healthy partner is overburdened, feels trapped, between work at work AND work at home, being a caregiver. Give each other a break. Hug it out.

I am less picky, and happy to eat a smorgasbord of leftovers and freezer items if it means I don't have to cook.

2) She has needed to get a second open heart surgery, which did not go as well. 2 year recover process, with me at her side, very slow and painful. It bought us close, and yet also far apart. She is on blood thinners for life now, requiring an even more restrictive diet, and monthly tests to ensure her levels are right. Her energy is crap - she sleeps 9-10 hours a night, often badly. (She rarely keeps me up though.). She can't work outside the house- her heart issues keep her energy fairly limited. She could probably work a part-time job, but she had medical appointments almost every day that would make it basically impossible to keep a regular schedule, plus she's introverted and it drains her quickly to spend a lot of time outside the house. So she does some private practice telephone work from home (she is a dietitian). But she isn't making any real money -- a few hundred a month at best, and it just builds up in an account where it slowly grows, it doesn't get added to the household income. $3000 accumulated so far, after about a year.

She manages to do the laundry, and usually the shopping. She has a dog and cat from her ""previous life"", which she takes care of (and they are getting old, so they require more care than typical). The dishes fall to me, as does a high pressure job working about 9 hour days and sometimes weekends and evenings to bring in enough money to support us both, pay down our debts, pay her student loan bills, pay the ailing pets with vet bills, pay child support for my daughter from another marriage. I make A LOT of money, and we are starting to finally climb out of the financial hole we were in for several years, but I have given everything I've got to my job in order to make this happen, and I come home exhausted most days after a long commute each direction.

3) Her anxiety and depression have gotten gradually worse - up and down, but a downward trend overall. She is isolated and lonely staying at home all day, though has gotten somewhat better as she has gotten more clients and we have made more friends. That said, she has more bad days than good, often despondent and depressed about her health and how little she's gotten done, or anxious about how much she has to do and how little time and energy she has left to do it. My patience and empathy have begun to wear thin over time, leading to guilt and depression for me as well. I want to be there for her, I want to support her. But I can only hear about the same aches and pains and anxieties and problems so many times before I start to feel futile and frustrated, helpless and angry.

The truth is that I don't really want to leave her. I want her in my life. I love her.

But... I miss her. I don't feel like I get to see her anymore... I don't feel like she is the same person, or like we can inhabit the same space together that we had when we met. The rare times that she feels good enough that we can be happy and at ease together feel farther and farther apart. She has some physical issues that sometimes prevent sex as well, and they have limited our intimacy... Now it is about once a or twice a month that we make love. It used to be 2-3 times a week.

And I can see that it's not her fault.. I do think that her emotional and mental issues exacerbate the problem, but I do see her taking responsibility for them, over and over. She goes to therapy, she goes to doctors appoints and specialists... Most of her health issues are either undiagnoseable or untreatable. It's really a miracle she's alive at all... And I try to be grateful for that, and for the time we get spend together.

Her new heart valves are supposed to last another 20-30 years, which should get us to 60-70 before she dies. She has said she doesn't want another heart surgery because the first two were so awful. Part of me thinks she is a fighter and that she will reconsider when the time comes and she has to choose between death or another heart surgery... Part of me thinks she might actually be ready by then.... That it might actually be best for her not to go under the knife again. Of course, who knows how long we really have together?

Anyone can go at any time - there is never a guarantee for any of us, and I think about that at least once a week now.

Part of me wants to say ""fuck it"" and spend the next few years doing our bucket list together... Except I know we would run out of money very quickly and the end result would not be good. 20-30 years is a long time.

I don't mind supporting her financially. I can make enough money that we can probably get some services to help us out (cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc), after a few more years of working my tail off. 

But I'm afraid it won't actually make her happy. I don't want to spend the next 20-30 years with someone who is miserable 80% of the time because she feels sick and helpless and believes she is just a burden to me (and in some ways, would be).

If she were ""spiritually enlightened"" and able to transcend her pain and be in acceptance around it, and not ask so much of me, then I could probably give a whole lot more. But the more I give, the more she has grown to expect a lot of me, and when I am too tired to deliver (or just don't feel like it), we fight.

Tonight we fought. She wanted me to go shopping, or take her to go out shopping since she couldn't drive because she had taken a pain medication earlier that kept her from driving. And it's not that I couldn't do it...

But I didn't feel like I had a choice about it. I felt like she wasn't really asking me.. She was demanding.

And when I tried to explain, she grew hurt and angry, and retreated to the bedroom.

This is happening more and more often. It's not good. It's not ""us"".

I want ""us"" back... But I don't know how to get it.



";9;"You have to set boundaries.  
I suggest you look at the website innerbonding by Dr.Margaret Paul.  Her material is excellent.  The very best in my opinion. 

The very last thing you said cemented it in my mind that you need to learn how to set boundaries- you feel she was demanding because she will lash out if you don’t do what she wants you to do. 

This is an unhealthy pattern- and you are trying to control her anger by doing what she asks.  It seems like your goal is to control her anger, to make sure she doesn’t get angry, more than you are worried about doing what’s in the highest good of the situation (which includes what’s in the highest good of yourself). 

You need to take care of you- take care of yourself and find ways to create your own joy in your own life.  If she is physically capable of doing something on her own, then you at enabling her dependency (I’ll say fake dependency, because it sounds like a lot of these things you listed she can actually do for herself, even though it’s labored) on you by doing things she can do herself. 

You can’t force her to take responsibility for her own happiness and for taking good care of herself, but you can take responsibility for taking good care of yourself and for pursuing your own happiness, joy, and the highest good.

How can I [41/M] find my way back to love with my wife [F/42] who has chronic health problems (can't work, heart, pain, and digestive issues)? (6 year relationship);t3_8d34by;7;"My wife and I have been together 6 years. We were both married and divorced before. We dated for 1.5 years, then got married. We felt we were soul mates from the very beginning (though I don't believe each person only has one compatible soul mate, I do believe that there are people with whom we are ""spiritually compatible"".) We had a sense that our souls ""knew each other"", and when we're connected and things are ""good"", I still feel this is true. I feel an amazing and deep connection with her that I've never had with anyone before. I've had about 7 relationships in my life, been married twice before, once a brief and impulsive marriage right out of high school that only lasted a year. The other a sprawling 12 year thing that ended very badly, with someone who I am now fairly certain has serious personality issues.

I had both eyes wide open when I met my (now) current wife, and I was looking for the warning signs I'd tripped up on in my previous relationships... Being impulsive, compromising too much on what I wanted, letting myself become a human doormat (my typical pattern). And the first few years were fantastic. The most amazing experiences I've had with anyone.

But everything has gotten slowly worse over the last three years, as her health issues have mounted and compounded. She started out with a low baseline... When I met her, she was on medication for anxeity and depression, had IBS, Fibromyalgia (chronic pain, chronic fatigue), had already had open heart surgery for a valve replacement, plus chronic migraines. She had good days and bad days, good months and bad months.

But during the first three years or so, the good months outnumbered the bad. I would put her baseline at about 60-70% of normal in terms of energy, quality of life, mood stability, self-responsibility (ability to independently support herself financially and physically).

Over the last three years, things have not gone as well. I feel she has sunk to somewhere around 40% as a new baseline. Over the last three years, her health has declined in three important ways:

1) Her IBS has gotten gradually worse, requiring a strict and complex diet that restricts what she can eat, and forces us to cook mostly from scratch. Going out to eat is possible, but never simple. It is always a complex ""problem solving"" exercise as we research menus in advance and attempt to determine if she will be able to eat anything there. Shopping and meal planning is similarly complicated, and leaves me feeling put-upon much of the time because the cooking usually falls to me, either because she doesn't have the energy, or because she's unwilling to BBQ, or because I'm a bit better at more complex recipes. So there is this food issue in our relationship that is a BIG deal. It creates resentment in both directions, from her, because if I come home from work too tired to cook, she ends up being forced to cook, or eating something she doesn't want out of the freezer. It creates resentment from me, because I feel she expects me to cook when I get home, and she is fairly picky, in addition to needing from-scratch meals most of the time. I am less picky, and happy to eat a smorgasbord of leftovers and freezer items if it means I don't have to cook.

What about family? Do either of you have friends or family who could step in on occasion and help out? 



Look into meal or grocery delivery services, and have your wife do the ordering. 



She needs an outside support group. Whether it's in person meetings or online, she needs to talk to people going through similar situations, she can't always be relying on you for every bit of physical and emotional support, that's how caregivers wear out.



Also YOU need a support group. They'll have even more ideas on how to help you. Look into groups for caregivers.

But she isn't making any real money -- a few hundred a month at best, and it just builds up in an account where it slowly grows, it doesn't get added to the household income. $3000 accumulated so far, after about a year.

She manages to do the laundry, and usually the shopping. She has a dog and cat from her ""previous life"", which she takes care of (and they are getting old, so they require more care than typical). The dishes fall to me, as does a high pressure job working about 9 hour days and sometimes weekends and evenings to bring in enough money to support us both, pay down our debts, pay her student loan bills, pay the ailing pets with vet bills, pay child support for my daughter from another marriage. I make A LOT of money, and we are starting to finally climb out of the financial hole we were in for several years, but I have given everything I've got to my job in order to make this happen, and I come home exhausted most days after a long commute each direction.

3) Her anxiety and depression have gotten gradually worse - up and down, but a downward trend overall. She is isolated and lonely staying at home all day, though has gotten somewhat better as she has gotten more clients and we have made more friends. That said, she has more bad days than good, often despondent and depressed about her health and how little she's gotten done, or anxious about how much she has to do and how little time and energy she has left to do it. My patience and empathy have begun to wear thin over time, leading to guilt and depression for me as well. I want to be there for her, I want to support her. But I can only hear about the same aches and pains and anxieties and problems so many times before I start to feel futile and frustrated, helpless and angry.

The truth is that I don't really want to leave her. I want her in my life. I love her.

But... I miss her. I don't feel like I get to see her anymore... I don't feel like she is the same person, or like we can inhabit the same space together that we had when we met. The rare times that she feels good enough that we can be happy and at ease together feel farther and farther apart. She has some physical issues that sometimes prevent sex as well, and they have limited our intimacy... Now it is about once a or twice a month that we make love. It used to be 2-3 times a week.

And I can see that it's not her fault.. I do think that her emotional and mental issues exacerbate the problem, but I do see her taking responsibility for them, over and over. She goes to therapy, she goes to doctors appoints and specialists... Most of her health issues are either undiagnoseable or untreatable. It's really a miracle she's alive at all... And I try to be grateful for that, and for the time we get spend together.

Her new heart valves are supposed to last another 20-30 years, which should get us to 60-70 before she dies. She has said she doesn't want another heart surgery because the first two were so awful. Part of me thinks she is a fighter and that she will reconsider when the time comes and she has to choose between death or another heart surgery... Part of me thinks she might actually be ready by then.... That it might actually be best for her not to go under the knife again. Of course, who knows how long we really have together?

Anyone can go at any time - there is never a guarantee for any of us, and I think about that at least once a week now.

Part of me wants to say ""fuck it"" and spend the next few years doing our bucket list together... Except I know we would run out of money very quickly and the end result would not be good. 20-30 years is a long time.

I don't mind supporting her financially. I can make enough money that we can probably get some services to help us out (cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc), after a few more years of working my tail off. 

But I'm afraid it won't actually make her happy. I don't want to spend the next 20-30 years with someone who is miserable 80% of the time because she feels sick and helpless and believes she is just a burden to me (and in some ways, would be).

If she were ""spiritually enlightened"" and able to transcend her pain and be in acceptance around it, and not ask so much of me, then I could probably give a whole lot more. But the more I give, the more she has grown to expect a lot of me, and when I am too tired to deliver (or just don't feel like it), we fight.

Tonight we fought. She wanted me to go shopping, or take her to go out shopping since she couldn't drive because she had taken a pain medication earlier that kept her from driving. And it's not that I couldn't do it...

But I didn't feel like I had a choice about it. I felt like she wasn't really asking me.. She was demanding.

And when I tried to explain, she grew hurt and angry, and retreated to the bedroom.

This is happening more and more often. It's not good. It's not ""us"".

I want ""us"" back... But I don't know how to get it.



";9;You're getting burned out , you need some help , fast. Go to her GP and ask for respite care and a daily home health aid to come and do some of the work - cooking , cleaning , shopping etc. Next tell her you need a break, take some time off even if it's just a weekend.Switch off your phone and spend time by yourself reconnecting with you. This serves two purposes. You get some much needed time to reset, and she gets to see that she is more capable than she thinks. If you got hit by a bus she would have to cope, she needs to get up, take care of the pets and do more.At this point if you're not careful you'll have  health issues yourself. Get her to be more independent. If you got hit by a bus tomorrow she'd figure shit out;1;0.1111111111111111;[[0.9748916]];[[0.59555652]];-0.997;0.08900000000000001;0.777;0.134;0.7875;0.08;0.8859999999999999;0.034;-0.091;0.053040218842357885;0.14500000000000002;-0.09195978115764213
How can I [41/M] find my way back to love with my wife [F/42] who has chronic health problems (can't work, heart, pain, and digestive issues)? (6 year relationship);t3_8d34by;7;"My wife and I have been together 6 years. We were both married and divorced before. We dated for 1.5 years, then got married. We felt we were soul mates from the very beginning (though I don't believe each person only has one compatible soul mate, I do believe that there are people with whom we are ""spiritually compatible"".) We had a sense that our souls ""knew each other"", and when we're connected and things are ""good"", I still feel this is true. I feel an amazing and deep connection with her that I've never had with anyone before. I've had about 7 relationships in my life, been married twice before, once a brief and impulsive marriage right out of high school that only lasted a year. The other a sprawling 12 year thing that ended very badly, with someone who I am now fairly certain has serious personality issues.

I had both eyes wide open when I met my (now) current wife, and I was looking for the warning signs I'd tripped up on in my previous relationships... Being impulsive, compromising too much on what I wanted, letting myself become a human doormat (my typical pattern). And the first few years were fantastic. The most amazing experiences I've had with anyone.

But everything has gotten slowly worse over the last three years, as her health issues have mounted and compounded. She started out with a low baseline... When I met her, she was on medication for anxeity and depression, had IBS, Fibromyalgia (chronic pain, chronic fatigue), had already had open heart surgery for a valve replacement, plus chronic migraines. She had good days and bad days, good months and bad months.

But during the first three years or so, the good months outnumbered the bad. I would put her baseline at about 60-70% of normal in terms of energy, quality of life, mood stability, self-responsibility (ability to independently support herself financially and physically).

Over the last three years, things have not gone as well. I feel she has sunk to somewhere around 40% as a new baseline. Over the last three years, her health has declined in three important ways:

1) Her IBS has gotten gradually worse, requiring a strict and complex diet that restricts what she can eat, and forces us to cook mostly from scratch. Going out to eat is possible, but never simple. It is always a complex ""problem solving"" exercise as we research menus in advance and attempt to determine if she will be able to eat anything there. Shopping and meal planning is similarly complicated, and leaves me feeling put-upon much of the time because the cooking usually falls to me, either because she doesn't have the energy, or because she's unwilling to BBQ, or because I'm a bit better at more complex recipes. So there is this food issue in our relationship that is a BIG deal. It creates resentment in both directions, from her, because if I come home from work too tired to cook, she ends up being forced to cook, or eating something she doesn't want out of the freezer. It creates resentment from me, because I feel she expects me to cook when I get home, and she is fairly picky, in addition to needing from-scratch meals most of the time. I am less picky, and happy to eat a smorgasbord of leftovers and freezer items if it means I don't have to cook.

2) She has needed to get a second open heart surgery, which did not go as well. 2 year recover process, with me at her side, very slow and painful. It bought us close, and yet also far apart. She is on blood thinners for life now, requiring an even more restrictive diet, and monthly tests to ensure her levels are right. Her energy is crap - she sleeps 9-10 hours a night, often badly. (She rarely keeps me up though.). She can't work outside the house- her heart issues keep her energy fairly limited. She could probably work a part-time job, but she had medical appointments almost every day that would make it basically impossible to keep a regular schedule, plus she's introverted and it drains her quickly to spend a lot of time outside the house. So she does some private practice telephone work from home (she is a dietitian). But she isn't making any real money -- a few hundred a month at best, and it just builds up in an account where it slowly grows, it doesn't get added to the household income. $3000 accumulated so far, after about a year.

If something really truly is out of both of your control (with absolutely no room for improvement) then cross it off the list.

Girfriend kissed another guy but told me;t3_8cyl0y;8;Me and my girl have been living together 1.5 years but talking for over 3. I love the shit out of this girl.

She was giving him a car ride and when he left he kissed her. She said she didn't know what to say and he kissed her again. I guess he said she looked uncomfortable so they said goodnight and left. She tries to talk to him Monday, what are they doing, does he know what kind of thing he is starting. And he had no answers. So she tells me after work. She says she likes him, but chooses me.

I [23M] am pressured by my GF [26] to get married...;t3_8d3jak;4;"This needs a lot of explanation....

Situation: I live in a country as an international student (same as my grilfriend) we want to stay in this country but to stay here we need to apply for the residency via our degrees. I can apply for it but she cannot since her degree not being valid for the country. Therefore the only way that we can both stay here is if we get married and apply together for the residency before December. We could just live together (she wants me to) but due to my religion I feel uncomfortable doing so... Therefore she wants us to get married so we can together stay here.



Relationship information: My girlfriend and I met at work, she used to date a guy from over there but as soon as we meet, we were in love and decided to break up with him and date me instead.

We started dating a little bit more than a year ago and we have had some relationship troubles such as me not dedicating too much time to her (I am studying a engineering degree and she is studying a hospitality diploma [she only has to study once a week and therefore has more free time than I]), she feels that I dont love her, she feels I dont want to get serious at the relationship, she thinks that I sometimes think about myself too much and not about her (because I focus a lot in my studies) etc. I do love her a lot, everytime I see her I smile and she is really the sweetest girl I have ever dated and incredibly beautiful! However when I am not with her, I sometimes ignore her messages, if she wants to hang out and I want to be with friends I rather being with my friends...
I believe our problem is the difference in age, she wants to get married asap and start a couples life and I just want to hang out a little bit more and focus on my career and my future...

What should I do? From this, do you guys think I do love her? I am confused and do not know what to do....

Edit: extra, we have broken-up up to two times in the a little bit more than a year we have been dating, but this is due to miscommunication and not talking directly to each other...

The immigration process will flag and question  you as who why you are married but not living together, and vise versa. Do NOT put yourself in a legally binding situation like this just for immigration purposes. Worst case, be long distance again until you can figure things out and see if the relationship will last.

I'm fairly new at using reddit so please bare with me if format is wrong....
I need help on figuring out how to go about this because I have never been in a relationship with someone who wasn't a friend. My past two relationships were with friends I grew feelings with. This guy to me was love at first sight and I need some guidance. 

I (f/24) have been in a relationship with an amazing and kind guy (m/25) for about two or three months now. He is very kind because he was the only guy I met who didn't reject me for being a virgin and awkward or weird af. ... no,He's not a virgin....XD  He says I'm not weird. I wish he will be the one I lose it to because I fell for him....because with him, I feel like I can truly be myself... He loves everything I love... games, movies, music, and even my favorite pizza place... We have talk about want in long term and we agree with important topics... we have lots of things in common and the things we don't have in common I or we don't mind  it or we (at least I am) interested in learning or doing things he loves...

the first/two months was great.... we would see each other every weekend and this last month we haven't seen each other because of work and school. He has a hard job due to its scheduling and he's about to graduate from school as well. I already graduate with a bachelor's degree.  Also he started to text me less and less... the conversations are starting to lag but I'm trying to think that he doesn't text back or engage because he's busy with work or just tired with his shifts. I asked him about the texting and he's says he's busy and that it doesn't bother him that I text him and  that he isn't ghosting me.... He still hasn't told me about details to his graduation either... but he did mention before that he wanted me there...

so I let everything be and hope everything is okay...

I don't know what he's feeling or thinking because he's not very open with his feelings or physical with me or our relationship. It seems like He's a quiet introvert add... I'm an ambivert with anxiety and I'm trying to be understanding and give him space. I don't want him to think I'm clingy or needy. 
I do show him and tell him how I feel... so there isn't any misunderstanding from myside ....but I do wish I could tell him that I love him... I'm waiting for him to say it... 

The time we have spent together, it's great but I have been me putting the effort or more effort in communication and physical attention too... I don't know if it's part of taking it slow or he doesn't want to be with me or idk... 

I don't mind his scheduling, the fact that he wants to take it slow, the way he is.... I accept everything about him, his past, present, and dream/goals. even the things he wants from me sexually when we get there and other things I disagree with but for him I willing to agree with  

I'm just afraid that he's being nice and doesn't want to hurt me so he trying to ghost me slowly
or
that I'm overthinking and I might ruin something amazing.

I'm afraid that everything that has happened and even him was just too good too be true...

It's been awhile since I felt this way

Should I stay quiet, and keep going and see where things go?
Should I talk to him about it?
Should I stay?
Should I leave? - I really don't want to leave, because I have always been the fighter to keep things going... and I don't want to give up on him... but I don't want be in relationship where I'm not wanted...
Should I tell him how I feel?
What are your thoughts?

Thank you

";1;"If I were you I’d tell him how you feel. How you feel is who you are &amp; if he wants to be with you, he’s going to have to accept that, at the same time you’re going to have to accept him for who he is until you guys meet in the middle. You’ve been the way you’ve been for a while, he’s probably been the way he’s been for a while, it’s not an overnight process &amp; you guys are still in the building stages of the relationship. (From how you sound, it doesn’t seem like you two have been dating long.)

If your suspicions of him slowly ghosting you worsen after the conversation, then I’d start retracting my feelings. Hard to do, but it’ll need to be done to avoid someone ghosting you out of the blue. Trust me, I know how that feels. 

Ultimately, if he tells you the same thing (school, work, etc) is his reasoning for seeming distant, just believe him &amp; have patience. 

Hope this helps.

An interesting situation;t3_8cz63d;4;"I’ll start by saying that I’m not open about this facet of my relationship with anyone other than my girlfriend. Talking about this issue is difficult for me, but here goes nothing.

So I [21/m] have been with my S.O. [20/f] for nearly four years now. We took a much needed break somewhere in there for reasons I won’t talk about in this post. Despite that, we have an incredibly strong, and, I believe, unconventional relationship. 

I say unconventional for a few reasons. For one, she goes to an out-of-state university while I stay back home; though, at the moment we are together for a while as I’m switching schools back home. Second, we found each other at vulnerable stages of our youth, but somehow managed to build a solid and mutually understanding relationship. Finally, we are sexually incompatible.

That last point is what I want to address in this post. See, I’m a fairly sexual person. By no means am I too much, but my spirit animal is definitely not the panda. As for my girlfriend, she is incredibly affectionate but she really isn’t a sexual person. This is most likely due to childhood trauma (emotional) as she’s a particularly sensitive individual. Moreover, she suffers from an anxiety disorder. These factors haven’t stopped us from trying, though. We’ve developed a physical relationship over the years, but it is pretty much all foreplay of the non-penetrative and non-oral variety (so a lot of feeling up, essentially). She’s comfortable with this and says it makes her happy, but anything beyond that and she shuts down. She doesn’t respond to any more intimate acts and isn’t interested in performing them on me. 

I want to make it clear that we are very understanding of one another. I’ve learned not to try to get any further as I know she won’t want to. She knows I have needs and she does her best. She describes the experience as anxiety-inducing at a certain point, and that it has nothing to do with me. Rather, she says her fear is the act itself. Given this, I let the thought of anything more happening go. 

Also, I feel it necessary to mention that I’m not the only one to initiate physical contact. She does have a sexual drive, it is just incredibly limited and she’s usually satisfied relatively quickly. I know she could also function without it and be just as happy. To her, the satisfaction mostly comes from the closeness between the two of us that the situation creates.

In the past we’ve fought about the topic. Things would sort of blow up because I would get sexually frustrated and that would make her feel guilty. Every time it would end in a stalemate. She would guilt herself into offering to have sex, and I would back off and try to understand her internal struggle. Other times we would just both get upset but leave it at that. In recent months I sort of just resigned and held in my frustration, or I’d talk about it with her until nothing else could be said. Last time I brought it up I told her I just don’t want to try anymore, that if anything is to happen it’ll be HER own decision. She ended up liking this idea (before she wanted me to push her, to no avail), and it really made her feel much more at ease. She has made absolutely no guarantees, which we both know is for the best, and she’s said that if it ever does happen it could take years. 

Knowing these things, well it has created a perpetual internal conflict between my brain and my body. On the one hand I’m a sexual person and feel a need for sex with the person I love. On the other hand I can sympathize with her and hope we can just be happy. I’ll admit, though, that this situation hurts. I don’t really feel wanted physically, and to a degree I feel like I’m wasting the joys of my youth (by this I mean experiences with her) by living like this. 

To be completely honest the situation is not unbearable. Our relationship and dynamic makes up for it to a degree. At the end of the day, though, my body tells me I want to have sex. I feel that I’ve met a dead end here. I don’t want to leave her, especially for this, but I don’t know that I can live like this for as long as we’re together.

What should I do? I’m fairly certain all has been said and contemplated, but I’m open to different perspectives and advice.

TL;DR. Don’t worry about it, I think the context is necessary with this one. I appreciate you stopping by this post, though. Have a good one!

";1;"Honestly, sex is important in a relationship and if you aren't on the same page sexual it is not fair to either partner. Some girls, particularly younger ones, have this idea that sex is ""gross"" and if a guy only is in the relationship for sex he's a ""pig"". That is very much not true. Sex is a natural and healthy part of an adult relationship.

That said, you to seems to be on completely different pages sexually, and it's not fair. You mentioned this is a long-distance relationship too. How would you feel about breaking up with this girl but remaining friends? It feels like that is what you want to do and what would make the most sense.";2;2.0;[[0.97234482]];[[0.51169896]];0.9964;0.161;0.7440000000000001;0.095;0.8776;0.126;0.836;0.038;-0.021999999999999992;0.1476105471795127;0.15205882352941175;-0.004448276349899083
An interesting situation;t3_8cz63d;4;"I’ll start by saying that I’m not open about this facet of my relationship with anyone other than my girlfriend. Talking about this issue is difficult for me, but here goes nothing.

So I [21/m] have been with my S.O. [20/f] for nearly four years now. We took a much needed break somewhere in there for reasons I won’t talk about in this post. Despite that, we have an incredibly strong, and, I believe, unconventional relationship. 

I say unconventional for a few reasons. For one, she goes to an out-of-state university while I stay back home; though, at the moment we are together for a while as I’m switching schools back home. Second, we found each other at vulnerable stages of our youth, but somehow managed to build a solid and mutually understanding relationship. Finally, we are sexually incompatible.

That last point is what I want to address in this post. See, I’m a fairly sexual person. By no means am I too much, but my spirit animal is definitely not the panda. As for my girlfriend, she is incredibly affectionate but she really isn’t a sexual person. This is most likely due to childhood trauma (emotional) as she’s a particularly sensitive individual.

";1;"You sound pretty understanding, and it sounds like the two of you have something real.

I would wonder about a few things, if it were me. 

First, I'd be happy that physical intimacy - if not penetration or sexual satisfaction - were possible and enjoyed. That means a lot. Trust isn't always easy - to have or to get.

Second, I'd wonder about this trauma that you refer to. If there is a trauma - emotional or otherwise - that really, truly prevents some form of intimacy... You two are young. I doubt seriously that despite the love you feel for each other and the oh-so-necessary trust... 

If you feel that the trauma you sorta mentioned and skipped over is contributing to her holding back, not being 100% clear, etc... I doubt that the two of you or either one of you alone has the skills to work through that.

Trauma is a big word. When you are close to someone, it is easier to see sometimes, but the desire to be able to fix it sometimes blinds us to our limitations. 

How much do you know about this trauma? I suspect that a third party would be useful. If you don't know the specifics, maybe she should see someone alone for a little bit. If you do know the specifics - she trusted you with that - maybe you can see someone together for a little bit. 

It sounds like you are at an impasse. You seem to share a lot and care a lot with and about each other. That will hopefully see you through. But maybe there is something here that would benefit from a trained, objective voice? 

Good luck. Don't give up easily. It sounds like she is hurt, cares deeply about you, and even sees you as a comforting, protective place to be. 

For now. Be that safe-space - but push her a little into talking to a professional. With or without you - at least at first - at her preference.

";1;"You're incompatible. You handed her the keys to your sexual relationship knowing that you were the only one interested in the trip and that you wouldn't like the way she drove.

You were untruthful when you said you would accept her being in charge of your sexual life, and you weren't truthful when you accepted her honest statement that the trip would take years.

";1;"I've actually been in a similar situation as your girlfriend in that my sex drive is much lower than my boyfriends' sex drive, and we've been together for 2 years. I can relate to you in that my boyfriend and I have had countless conversations about this exact topic, and the frustration on your end is exactly like his. 

What I can tell you from my experience is that you are doing everything in your power that is right by giving her a chance to come to you, not forcing anything on her, and certainly not pushing her unnecessarily. Sometimes we'll feel guilty and do it to make you happy, even if we know we're all feeling guilty doing it! By no means is any of this your fault, and I hope that if you didn't already know that, that you know that now. 

If something has happened in your girlfriend's past that is actively preventing her from being intimate with you sexually (as in, full-on sex, not just cuddling and the high school basics) then I'd try to suggest sex therapy, or a therapist that specializes in diagnosing exactly what it is that is keeping her in the little bubble she seems so comfortable in. It could be as easy as the medical side effects of her birth control that is holding her back, or could be as big as the trauma you mention she suffered, which would need someone who is professionally trained here in order to slowly open that door. Once you know what is causing the hold-up, you'll be able to make better decisions about what to do going forward.

It’s their ego more than them wanting you. 
Or it’s their need to feel like you still want them. Even though they’re in a relationship.

If I were in a relationship with another woman, I don't think I would be investing time into these ""fun, light, and flirty"" texts like she is. 

And no, I do not want her back and I'm not trying to get her back. I'm just curious to see if this is normal. Thank you!

";4;I talk to my ex every single day. She's my best friend and I love her just as much as when we were dating. I don't let a label stress me out when it comes to communication.

As an attractive woman, I love feeling hot. I love the days where I put on my makeup, have a hot outfit on, and my hair is on point... I feel full of life/energy; i feel like me. This isn't to say I'm against going out w/o any makeup on either. This is just as fine, but I must say (for example last night I worked as a bartender and looked on point and today I have zero makeup on/have yet to even look in the mirror ((and I'm at work 0_0)) the days like today that I have zero makeup on, I don't want to be talked to. I feel blah; I don't feel like my sexy little self. 


All of that being said, she just wants to feel like herself. She loves feeling sexy. It gives her energy, makes her feel approachable, and gives her confidence. You know it doesn't mean she wants to put another dick in her. You're pretty aware (as far as I can tell) that the issue is your confidence. You're jealous because you don't feel good personally. You feel shitty; therefore, you get jealous when someone else feels good. Improve your self esteem. What happened? Did someone hurt you in the past? Tough childhood? Do you feel gross looking? Where does this come from? ";5;1.25;[[0.98003581]];[[0.59965518]];-0.868;0.14300000000000002;0.644;0.214;0.9681;0.213;0.655;0.132;-0.152;-0.060606060606060635;0.2411111111111111;-0.3017171717171717

It's so annoying.";4;"As I understand it, there are two reasons for jealousy. First: You notice something that's against your agreement with your partner and that gives you (rightfully) the feeling of jealousy. Second: There is nothing wrong with you and your partner, but something triggers insecurity or something else in you that makes you feel jealous. 

You said that there's nothing to actually worry about. Your partner is loyal and simply expressing herself with choice of clothing. Attempting to limit her self expression to compensate for something in you would be wrong. 

Time to dig into what your feelings are and why your partner's clothes choices bother you. I can't really answer this for you. But for me it's usually a nagging feeling of not being entirely good enough, sexy enough, or [insert any human attribute] enough for my standards, and thus being afraid that my partner feels the same way about me and might want to find someone better. 

Then it's really two of either paths. Just accept that this is the way I am and this is good enough. Or set on changing whatever I think needs changed. In either case it's good to accept that changing takes time and it's OK to be a human who's in progress, and that's commendable in itself.

A lot of the time these feelings arise from experiences of rejection or other things we've been through that have dented our self esteem. Becoming aware of the root of these feelings can make it easier to take care of ourselves and reach out for help when we need it. Precisely with jealousy it can be hard to talk about it with your partner, because it can lead to them trying to compensate for you, which, as stated before, leads to nowhere good. But it's a lot easier when you learn to recognise the underlying feelings. That's the difference between ""you make me jealous"" and ""I'm having some feelings of insecurity because of my life experience having programmed me to think y"".

I hope that this makes sense. Good luck with your search for answers.

Edit: I used to be with someone who didn't take ownership of their insecurities and had their jealousy running rampant. I'm naturally flirtatious when happy, but extremely loyal to my partners and it hurt me a lot that my partner didn't trust me. I did the wrong thing and stopped going out and ended up with almost no friends. This is why I mention the importance of recognising the root of the problem and ownership.

I feel like my boyfriend is lazy. But I’m trying to justify actually feeling this way because...;t3_8db9qq;5;" My boyfriend is 30y/o and I’m 23y/o.  I’ve been living with him for almost 2 years now. He’s a very sweet, kind, funny, and gentle guy. He’s the first guy I dated that was truly good to me. (I didn’t make good decisions in men back then) 

He is the “breadwinner” of the house. He pays for all the bills, the groceries, and well..basically most things that involves $$$ he handles it. The only payments I have to handle are the pet fees, my shopping (for things like clothes, makeup,etc), and my own medical fees.   We have three cats and one dog. He stream games for hours (from 9PM-5AM) on end for his career and I do drawing for streamers like him. I don’t make a lot so I appreciate all that he does financially. So I try to do my part by cleaning around the house, doing all chores, looking after the pets, and draw things for his streaming channels too. All he has to do is take out the trash. 

The fact that he already pays for pretty much everything makes me feel bad for ever feeling like he’s “not helpful” or not being considerate on my behalf since it can really go both ways. Like how is he not helpful and considerate if he’s already paying for everything? But I just feel like even so, it doesn’t hurt to offer me some help sometimes. 

Here’s why I feel like he’s lazy, sometimes inconsiderate, and unhelpful.

-he leaves his socks and boxers literally everywhere. He would take it off, and just leave it there.

-he would leave cans of coke or cups of coffees for days on a table before he thinks about disposing it unless it’s completely piled up. 

-he never thinks about doing laundry, or put his clothes into the laundry basket. The floor is where all his dirty clothes go and I pick it up.

-he would leave dirty dishes in the sink for weeks. Whenever I ask if he’s going to do them, his response is either always “I will.” Or “later.” But if I don’t touch it, it can be there for weeks. LITERALLY.

-he showers and brushes his teeth once per week, twice if lucky. But we only ever really go out for food so he doesn’t ever really reek... but still gross imo.

-he would never want to bring the dog out for a walk on his own for more than 15 minutes. He hates idly walking. Or any exercise in general. We have daily 7am doggy get together in the mornings at the neighborhood park where our dogs can play for an hr to exercise and I’m the only one who brings the dog out for it while he’d rather stay at home and play games on his phone.

-he’s too lazy to cook, or go to the supermarket for groceries so I can cook instead. so we always order out. Fast foods mostly, Hawaiian food, or Chinese food.

-on his days off, he prefers mostly sleeping, eating, watching shows, and playing games. Nothing active. 


A week ago, I got sent to the ER for gallstones and had to get my gallbladder removed so there’s a lot of things I can’t physically do due to my surgical wounds. I can’t walk too much, I’m always hunched over due to the pain, and I need to start a new cardiac diet at least for another 2 weeks. That makes it difficult for me to do the chores, handle the pets, and well basically anything. While I was in the ER , he was planning to stream anyway. I was emotionally distressed and in pain and needed him. I had to beg him to take off stream days to stay with me. Took a lot of begging and then he finally decide to take off. However while he stayed with me overnight for a few nights in the hospital, all he mostly did, was sleep on the couch. He was not at my bedside, he barely spoke to me except for letting me know he was going home to feed the dog or just simply ask if I was okay before he head back to the couch again. The nurses were there to help me get up and walk me to the bathroom more than he did. But for me I decide to look at it as “at least he’s actually here, and you’re not alone in the hospital”. It was pretty bad timing for a gallstone attack since it did line up with some of his scheduled sponsored streams, so I get that it may be difficult to skip it to take care of me. 

I stayed in the hospital for a week and when I was finally being released, he had to fly to LA for his sponsored business trip for two days so his mom had to drive me home and I had to wait til night for my dad to fly in from NYC to take care of me in my bf’s absence. 

While my dad was here, he did a lot for me. We went to get groceries, he cooked for me, he helped me into/our of the car, helped me out of bed, cut me fruits, spent quality time with me, washed the dishes, and cleaned. I cried so hard when he had to leave but it made me realized a lot of things I felt like I was missing. 

When my bf was back, I helped myself into and out of the car despite the pain. Cooking was too tedious so he’d rather order out. He did help me out of the bed though and take the dog out to potty but not on actual walks. The only thing my bf wants to do is watch and eat with me, (though granted, I can’t do much anyway in the state I’m in) and then just sleep. He made me walk with him to take the dog out to potty and while he’s already a block ahead I was barely half the block. He didn’t wait for me, my dog did. I was running out of breath and in pain, no one to hold me for support. He left all the dirty dishes in the sink, I ended up having to wash them out myself while hunching over or sitting on a chair while he mostly is either sleeping or playing games on his phone. The day he’s finally home from his business trip, he’d rather stream. So I ended up by myself in my bedroom trying to get things done on my own. 

I guess I’m ranting on but it’s just been difficult that I can’t get things done, he’s not really being helpful. And even when I’m physically capable, he has never once offered to help me if he sees me struggling. He would never say things like “Hey babe. Do you need help with that?” Or anything of the sort.  But I will give him credit to say that he’s slowly working on it because one time I was removing sticker residue from the floor and he helped me briefly. 

He usually won’t do things unless he’s told to and even sometimes when I do tell him, he would procrastinate. 

We HAVE talked about this issue multiple times. And his arguments were always that I always want things done at a specific time or right away. When say for example I ask him to help with the dishes and he says later, and two weeks later it’s still there. His definition of “later” could mean from hours to weeks. So I try to compromise and not “nag” so much and only try to remind him ONCE per TWO days. 

I get that he pays for everything but sometimes I feel like I’m more like his mom and company than anything. I don’t want to always have to remind him to get something done constantly, to pick up after himself, to help me when I obviously need help (like if I’m struggling to carry something, he’d watch me struggle until I ask), and to be told im always complaining when i just want to tell him what’s wrong. We have ants in the house now, I hate seeing garbage pile up on the kitchen counter, and I hate seeing napkins, socks, shirts, underwear all over the bedroom floor, etc. I hate seeing our dining table piled with trash.

Like I said, I always do all the cleaning, list out all the necessities we need to get (sometimes be stalls so long I even get it myself). But it seems like he never tries to make my day any easier for me.  

I don’t know what to do. Please advise me, Reddit. No, I do not what to leave him, I want to believe he can improve. But if there’s something else I can do better for the situation, feel free to let me know too.

EDIT: please do not say anything mean about him as I am very defensive when it comes to him cos I love him very much still. Helpful advice only.";2;"To be honest with you what you said at the top already makes me confused. You say you eat out most of the time but cook most of the time? Who pays for that him? So you don't actually have to cook either. Tbh, and I'm sure this will come off as rude, but if he's paying for everything and taking care of everything I don't see how him not cleaning up after himself is such a huge deal. When it comes to him not wanting to be active go out exercise etc did that begin recently or has he always been this way? If you've been together for two years you have two options either he's changing in a way you can't cope and you need to either leave or try your best to cope. Or you're changing and not liking what he's always been which if that's the case the simple fact of the matter is you can't force someone to change to what you want to be now. As far as helpful advice I'll be 100% blunt with you most girls I know around your age have to work full time and pay most of the bills for their guys who don't even go to school and only work part time getting paid nothing and blowing it on pot, and other garbage. The fact he's covering for you when it comes to money well you're not gonna see that a lot of today's youth.

Sit down truly think about your options could you find gainful employment to take care of yourself? Would you prefer that over having to deal with him not cleaning up after himself? If not then your options already made.

I feel like my boyfriend is lazy. But I’m trying to justify actually feeling this way because...;t3_8db9qq;5;" My boyfriend is 30y/o and I’m 23y/o.  I’ve been living with him for almost 2 years now. He’s a very sweet, kind, funny, and gentle guy. He’s the first guy I dated that was truly good to me. (I didn’t make good decisions in men back then) 

He is the “breadwinner” of the house. He pays for all the bills, the groceries, and well..basically most things that involves $$$ he handles it. The only payments I have to handle are the pet fees, my shopping (for things like clothes, makeup,etc), and my own medical fees.   We have three cats and one dog. He stream games for hours (from 9PM-5AM) on end for his career and I do drawing for streamers like him. I don’t make a lot so I appreciate all that he does financially. So I try to do my part by cleaning around the house, doing all chores, looking after the pets, and draw things for his streaming channels too. All he has to do is take out the trash. 

The fact that he already pays for pretty much everything makes me feel bad for ever feeling like he’s “not helpful” or not being considerate on my behalf since it can really go both ways. Like how is he not helpful and considerate if he’s already paying for everything? But I just feel like even so, it doesn’t hurt to offer me some help sometimes. 

Here’s why I feel like he’s lazy, sometimes inconsiderate, and unhelpful.

-he leaves his socks and boxers literally everywhere. He would take it off, and just leave it there.

-he would leave cans of coke or cups of coffees for days on a table before he thinks about disposing it unless it’s completely piled up. 

-he never thinks about doing laundry, or put his clothes into the laundry basket. The floor is where all his dirty clothes go and I pick it up.

-he would leave dirty dishes in the sink for weeks. Whenever I ask if he’s going to do them, his response is either always “I will.” Or “later.” But if I don’t touch it, it can be there for weeks. LITERALLY.

-he showers and brushes his teeth once per week, twice if lucky. But we only ever really go out for food so he doesn’t ever really reek... but still gross imo.

-he would never want to bring the dog out for a walk on his own for more than 15 minutes. He hates idly walking. Or any exercise in general. We have daily 7am doggy get together in the mornings at the neighborhood park where our dogs can play for an hr to exercise and I’m the only one who brings the dog out for it while he’d rather stay at home and play games on his phone.

-he’s too lazy to cook, or go to the supermarket for groceries so I can cook instead. so we always order out. Fast foods mostly, Hawaiian food, or Chinese food.

-on his days off, he prefers mostly sleeping, eating, watching shows, and playing games. Nothing active. 


A week ago, I got sent to the ER for gallstones and had to get my gallbladder removed so there’s a lot of things I can’t physically do due to my surgical wounds. I can’t walk too much, I’m always hunched over due to the pain, and I need to start a new cardiac diet at least for another 2 weeks. That makes it difficult for me to do the chores, handle the pets, and well basically anything. While I was in the ER , he was planning to stream anyway. I was emotionally distressed and in pain and needed him. I had to beg him to take off stream days to stay with me. Took a lot of begging and then he finally decide to take off. However while he stayed with me overnight for a few nights in the hospital, all he mostly did, was sleep on the couch. He was not at my bedside, he barely spoke to me except for letting me know he was going home to feed the dog or just simply ask if I was okay before he head back to the couch again. The nurses were there to help me get up and walk me to the bathroom more than he did. But for me I decide to look at it as “at least he’s actually here, and you’re not alone in the hospital”. It was pretty bad timing for a gallstone attack since it did line up with some of his scheduled sponsored streams, so I get that it may be difficult to skip it to take care of me. 

I stayed in the hospital for a week and when I was finally being released, he had to fly to LA for his sponsored business trip for two days so his mom had to drive me home and I had to wait til night for my dad to fly in from NYC to take care of me in my bf’s absence. 

While my dad was here, he did a lot for me. We went to get groceries, he cooked for me, he helped me into/our of the car, helped me out of bed, cut me fruits, spent quality time with me, washed the dishes, and cleaned. I cried so hard when he had to leave but it made me realized a lot of things I felt like I was missing. 

When my bf was back, I helped myself into and out of the car despite the pain. Cooking was too tedious so he’d rather order out. He did help me out of the bed though and take the dog out to potty but not on actual walks. The only thing my bf wants to do is watch and eat with me, (though granted, I can’t do much anyway in the state I’m in) and then just sleep. He made me walk with him to take the dog out to potty and while he’s already a block ahead I was barely half the block. He didn’t wait for me, my dog did. I was running out of breath and in pain, no one to hold me for support. He left all the dirty dishes in the sink, I ended up having to wash them out myself while hunching over or sitting on a chair while he mostly is either sleeping or playing games on his phone. The day he’s finally home from his business trip, he’d rather stream. So I ended up by myself in my bedroom trying to get things done on my own. 

I guess I’m ranting on but it’s just been difficult that I can’t get things done, he’s not really being helpful. And even when I’m physically capable, he has never once offered to help me if he sees me struggling. He would never say things like “Hey babe. Do you need help with that?” Or anything of the sort.  But I will give him credit to say that he’s slowly working on it because one time I was removing sticker residue from the floor and he helped me briefly. 

He usually won’t do things unless he’s told to and even sometimes when I do tell him, he would procrastinate. 

We HAVE talked about this issue multiple times. And his arguments were always that I always want things done at a specific time or right away. When say for example I ask him to help with the dishes and he says later, and two weeks later it’s still there. His definition of “later” could mean from hours to weeks. So I try to compromise and not “nag” so much and only try to remind him ONCE per TWO days. 

I get that he pays for everything but sometimes I feel like I’m more like his mom and company than anything. I don’t want to always have to remind him to get something done constantly, to pick up after himself, to help me when I obviously need help (like if I’m struggling to carry something, he’d watch me struggle until I ask), and to be told im always complaining when i just want to tell him what’s wrong. We have ants in the house now, I hate seeing garbage pile up on the kitchen counter, and I hate seeing napkins, socks, shirts, underwear all over the bedroom floor, etc. I hate seeing our dining table piled with trash.

Like I said, I always do all the cleaning, list out all the necessities we need to get (sometimes be stalls so long I even get it myself). But it seems like he never tries to make my day any easier for me.  

I don’t know what to do. Please advise me, Reddit. No, I do not what to leave him, I want to believe he can improve. But if there’s something else I can do better for the situation, feel free to let me know too.

Not to dismiss anything you're saying, because it is shitty that you had to convince him to come visit you in the hospital, but if he's getting paid by streaming and that's the reason the bills are being paid, it IS a full time job. Whenever he's scheduled, you could try thinking of it as him being at work, and so him being ""lazy"" in those hours shouldn't be a problem.

However, after he's done then yeah, I agree that maybe he should stop being so lazy. It's tough because being in a chair, gaming all day for money gives you bad habits and takes a toll, because you're in that groove and you just feel lazy and shitty. I feel shitty after extensive gaming as well, like a lot people.

Before anything, understand that this is a full-time job, and I'm not saying you don't understand, because you do seem understanding of all this. Also, maybe you're just underestimating how much he does for you? Granted, the house is in a shitty condition, but you can't say he never tries to make your day easier because he's giving you a place to stay, to sleep in, to eat in, etc. That's already a huge, huge weight off your shoulders, so appreciate that first-hand. (Again, not saying you don't appreciate it, because I'm sure you do.)

How to go about it though? It's tough, because he does a lot for you financially, and that's important. Personally, I'm stubborn as fuck and I hate being told what to do, and I hate myself for it. I'm not sure if he's the same way, and you said he says you ""nag"" him, which is pretty bullshit. Maybe try asking him after his scheduled stream to do a chore. If he doesn't do it when he's free, then he really needs to grow up and learn how to act, and that's not your job to teach him that. Worst case scenario, you just start doing nothing as well and let shit pile up, see how he likes it once it gets too much, and if he says he's paying the bills so you should work, then he's not good for you and the money you save dating him won't be worth it.";1;0.5;[[0.98467447]];[[0.67823732]];0.2059;0.09300000000000001;0.815;0.091;-0.9261;0.145;0.693;0.161;0.018000000000000016;0.04158559804393138;-0.08199233716475099;0.12357793520868238

Yeah, no.  Not only did he decide that having this recording in the first place was more important to him than making sure you were okay with it, *keeping* it was more important than respecting your clearly stated wishes, and dodging responsibility when caught was more important than actually fixing the problem.  That doesn't go away because he put a ring on your finger, and it doesn't say good things about what you can expect from him the next time he wants something and you don't.

If you insist on taking him back, don't do it without premarital counseling.  But I wouldn't bother.

You are not responsible for his life, or his choices nor are you responsible for his mental health. By sticking around you only enable this unhealthy co-dependency to continue to deepen and risk damaging your own mental health as well.

Just tell him that you don't feel this relationship is something you want anymore but that you wish him the best and then ghost out, sever/block all forms of contact from him.

UPDATE: How long do you take to text a new girl/guy?;t3_8ckdvv;4;"Here we are 9 days later and I’m (F/23) at the gym and my phone buzzes. Who is it? The guy from the bar (M/27) that I slept with and was interested in. After day 3 I figured oh well, and just kept living my life without thinking about it much.

After NINE days, he hits me with the “hey” text mid morning. Part of me felt like I probably shouldn’t answer bc what was he doing for 9 days? But on the other hand I AM interested. It wasn’t a late night booty call so may as well see what the deal is.

So I answered and we proceeded to have a casual conversation about what we each did over the weekend and he joked about when we hung out and he ran out of condoms and I said it’s ok, I’d love to see him again, with or without Sex and he asked which I’d prefer. 

I said I’d prefer a combination of both. What I meant by this is hanging out and getting to know him and also sex because who doesn’t love sex with someone they’re attracted to. 

He just hasn’t answered since 1pm. I don’t think this is necessarily meant to be rude on his part, but It’s frustrating. Maybe he’s a flake. I’m a pretty patient person.

Look, I’m telling you this for your own good. He’s treated you like he barely valued you... and then you responded eagerly at the first scrap of attention he gave you. Then he ignored you again! And you’re still pining for his attention. For god sakes girl, stop letting him do this to you.

UPDATE: How long do you take to text a new girl/guy?;t3_8ckdvv;4;"Here we are 9 days later and I’m (F/23) at the gym and my phone buzzes. Who is it? The guy from the bar (M/27) that I slept with and was interested in. After day 3 I figured oh well, and just kept living my life without thinking about it much.

After NINE days, he hits me with the “hey” text mid morning. Part of me felt like I probably shouldn’t answer bc what was he doing for 9 days? But on the other hand I AM interested. It wasn’t a late night booty call so may as well see what the deal is.

So I answered and we proceeded to have a casual conversation about what we each did over the weekend and he joked about when we hung out and he ran out of condoms and I said it’s ok, I’d love to see him again, with or without Sex and he asked which I’d prefer. 

I said I’d prefer a combination of both. What I meant by this is hanging out and getting to know him and also sex because who doesn’t love sex with someone they’re attracted to. 

He just hasn’t answered since 1pm. I don’t think this is necessarily meant to be rude on his part, but It’s frustrating. Maybe he’s a flake. I’m a pretty patient person. I don’t come on here asking why someone hasn’t answered me when it’s been 30 minutes. But 9 hours??? What was the point of texting me 

Is this normal behavior???";2;"Some people are not glued to their phones, despite the majority of society believing this to be normal. Some people forget they've been messaged and forget to send a reply when they've seen the message and haven't replied immediately. Some people tell themselves they'll respond in five minutes and get distracted. Some people are strangely, and stupidly made to think that 'playing hard to get' is hot and thus wait for days and hours. 

Not everyone plays games. People need to chill and stop placing arbitrary time limits on others, making up rules and expectations in their own head for other people to meet without being explicit about them. The amount of hours or days or whatever means nothing, it's all bullshit. 

The amount of times I've been very rudely 'called out' via text for not responding within the approved time frame is ridiculous. It has made me cut those people out of my life. I don't need to be called rude when it's 3am and I don't reply within a half hour, I don't need to be told I'm a bitch and a terrible friend for not replying when I'm trying to give my full attention to someone else in real life and therefore haven't checked my phone.

If you can't stand that this guy isn't replying to you immediately, then find someone else who's glued to their phone. But also maybe take a step back, realise you're setting up expectations for this guy that he has no idea even exist and then getting irritated at him. If you start a relationship like that? With resentment and already thinking he's a flake? You're not going to get anywhere.

Girlfriend [24] of three years is immensely indecisive, trapped in a toxic situation. I'm male [29.];t3_8d0z59;3;"TL;DR: Had to move in with her parents (not entirely for financial reasons, though that was part of the decision.) Turns out (to my surprise) her entire family is toxic as fuck. We have the money to move, but she refuses for petty reasons.

To make a long story short me and her were living alone. I was working and she was going to school. I made just enough money to pay our bills (roughly 1000 a month.) First apartment had black mold, and we left. Second apartment had sewage problems and we had to move out. Gave up because we couldn't find a decent place to live so we gave up and moved in with her parents (roughly been living there for 8 months.)

Since we moved in her grades dropped, just as she was finishing up. Girlfriend finishes school and now makes 30 an hour, making anywhere between 15-40 hours a week in a different city. I have to drive her both ways because she 'can't drive.' and 'is learning' but won't put real effort into it. (Its a little more than an hour drive, one way.)

Given that she can't drive and relies on me for transportation I can't work. I could work. I want to work. But without her having a license (and anxiety holding her back) we can't move out of her parents place because she won't just make the leap. I've sat down and showed her: ""With X number of dollars in the bank we can easily move in, and if you only make 10 hours a week and I didn't work we could afford an apartment.""

Now here is the real problem: Her entire family is completely fucking toxic given one person as an exception. I didn't know this and she didn't really tell me. Her Father/Grandmother will tear her down constantly when I'm not around. Its warping her personality into someone she wasn't 3 years ago. Her dad is just a straight up Narcissist, and her grandmother had a stroke that makes her have rage fits. If her dad sees any confidence in her what-so-ever he will strip it out of her. Conflict after conflict he realized I'm basically an immovable object that he can't hurt or effect in anyway, and as such hes given up on it. Mostly because I mock him right to his face for being a 'child' and not a 'man.' (For clarity, I lift, and have 5 years of boxing/mauy-thai/Ju-Jitsu under my belt and he realized really quickly ""fighting me will only get me hurt and not him.""

She won't just say ""Fuck it"" and move out why? Because ""I can't drive so you won't be able to work."" IT WOULD TAKE THREE FUCKING WEEKS! THREE FUCKING WEEKS! (I'm a bit annoyed at this.)

I've expressed that if we stay there its going to hurt our relationship and all she falls back on is ""Driving"" and ""Money"" both of which aren't real problems. And when I say ""Not real problems"" I mean literally not real. We could do it on the money she makes, let alone what we have saved, and driving, again, will take three weeks.

She keeps bringing up pointless shit like ""where will you work?"" ""Where I find work.""

We have been together for 3 years now and for the first two of that we lived together alone, and everything was fucking amazing. But now that we have the capacity to leave this hellhole she won't just make the leap. Its literally to the point that she comes back, and gets into screaming matches with everyone around her all day long when shes not at work.

...it wasn't like this 3 years ago. We were fucking happy. We were forced into this position by both money and our apartment complex taking no action and us having to contact the health department on them, then getting evicted by said health department.

I don't get it: She puts so much into what her grandmother and dad think. Her grandmother is just straight up off the deep end and perpetually screaming at her Dad, and husband (Her grandfather) over things that make no sense (E.G.: ""YOU DIDN'T GET ME ANY FUCKING CANDY! WHY NOT! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"") When she is lucid shes a nice woman, but her stroke (or aneurism, I can't remember which) messed her personality up. So now asking her ""How do I look"" could evoke ""Great!"" or ""You are an ugly, ugly person, and I hope you burn in hell you whore.""

So One is obviously due to the stroke, and the other is you know, actually her. So why put any stock in it? Not the only person in my life with this exact problem either. You just have to over look it...which my girlfriend and her dad won't do. They will both scream in her face...like why tho?

Her dad is just a fucking narcissist to the wall. Everything is superficial, everything is fake, everything he says is a lie, everything is just to make himself 'feel cool.' and not actually get anything real done. Drug addict and worse. (ex drug addict now thanks to us moving in, but thats another story for another time.)

I don't know what to do: I love her, but we have to leave. We planed on being out the day she got work and now shes going back on her 'word' for really superficial reasons. I'm about to just give her an ultimatum ""Its we leave, or its I leave. Your choice.""

If I leave she never will get out of that place, and her dad will mooch off her for her entire life. Hes already trying to do it and I'm having to put a stop to it.";3;"I think that family is sensitive for her because of its toxic nature (I have some experience with that) and it's hard for her to just drop it. There are a bunch of reasons she's not listening about leaving like fear and anxiety of what will happen and whatnot. 

I think firstly get her to open up a bit about the situation you guys are in. She is definitely not okay with how things are, she just thinks she's trapped to stay in it so maybe try to talk to her about what's stressing her, etc. Communicate with her about what she needs and wants right now so you can bring in your thoughts and compromise. 

You're absolutely right about needing to leave that shithole. It sucks for both of you and will do permanent damage soon. But she has to think that and I feel like coming outright saying 'this sucks I want to leave' won't do that. Find out exactly what she's so worried about because I don't think it's the driving.

He left her because she wanted more than he could deal with — though I think it was more so because he wanted to fuck around (even though he won’t admit it). He admits that she made him insanely happy, he just wasn’t ready. I have been his best friend this whole time, and I saw him go through that phase, and I saw him regret it ever since. 

He reached out to her a couple years after they broke up, but she had moved on, and I even though he never admitted it, he would always talk about her in passing after that day, and I know he missed her. 

It seems like your situation is different in the sense that you don’t seem to be as naive as him, and if he is genuinely as mature as you describe, he will understand why you did it.

Once late December/early January rolled around, I started talking to her and for the most part, we have really good conversations. She’d smile and laugh and I would feel really good vibes. She doesn’t make eye contact but she’d sometimes make really quick/barelynoticable glabces towards me. When we have a good conversation and lunch ends, me and her would walk and talk and head to our next class. 
There are days where we don’t talk or exchange a few words only (and there are days where it’s sometimes awkward), but overall, I think it’s been good so far (then again, maybe I’m just being a bit too optimistic...). 

I was planning to get her Facebook and maybe phone # last week but people were taking the seat where I’d usually sit whenever I go and sit with her. I was planning on talking with her over the weekend but then never got the chance to get her contact info. I was originally planning to ask her out later this week but I feel like I should get her contact info first. 

So, what do you think would be best? Personally, I’m changing things up due to time and might just ask her out later this week and if it goes well, maybe add her. But would that be ideal? 


Also, in the event that she says yes to me asking her out, how do I do this? I don’t have a car and don’t have much money. ";1;"“Want to grab a coffee sometime?”

"How long to ""know"" when they're the one? (30M)";t3_8cwu2u;2;"So it seems like in generations past (I am 30M, and am mostly referring to both my parents' and my grandparents' generations here) it was not all that uncommon to have an extremely short courtship/engagement period, especially compared to today's standards. Factor in all the ""don't text back more than 3x a day, and wait 3 days before doing that, and god forbid don't ever CALL them for at least a month"" type BS, and things now can move pretty slowly.

You hear all the time about someone's dad or grandpa proposing on a third date or something absolutely wild like that, but you seemingly never hear of it now. Were they just a more romantic generation? Perhaps maybe more impulsive? I can't think they were more impulsive as a whole than the average current 20-30something....

Anyway just wondering some things to look for when wondering about my current gf being ""the one"". I can honestly say that I have never been happier with anyone. A new concept that I've noticed in this relationship with her, is I have this near-compulsion to be incredibly nice and kind and helpful to her. I am not naturally a caring or nurturing person. I can be aloof, selfish, and detached. But with her, I have this strong desire to always do nice things, nice surprises, helpful stuff around the house/yard, and I generally care when I ask ""how was your day?"" (In previous relationships I would tune out about 3 sentences into that conversation).

It's different enough that my coworkers, friends, and family comment on my mood, my attitude, and apparently my happiness in this regard is pretty outwardly noticeable.

My gf says the people in her life have noticed the same thing.

We've had a few extended trips/vacations together, where it was just us, in cities/states where we knew no one, together 100% of the time for multiple days in a row. Each and every time we've never had even a spat (usually travel/scheduling/logistics stresses me out) and every day we wake up more excited to hang out with each other for another day. 

Conversely when we are apart we aren't clingy/annoying/high maintenance about it. We respect each other, trust each other, and are able to function fine apart, although at any given time of course, we'd prefer to be together.

For what it's worth, l'd marry her tomorrow. But I am a big fan of things running smoothly, I wouldn't want to appear impulsive, I wouldn't want a lot of scrutiny, and above all I'd like to be pretty sure she'd say yes haha. We haven't broached the subject a whole lot or real deeply, so while I'd like to think she'd be leaning towards a yes, obviously the rational part of me realizes when you ACTUALLY get asked the question, your mind works a lot differently when you are romantically BS'ing over coffee basking in a post coital glow, right? 

But anyway, I find it pretty interesting to hear about length of time together vs proposal time vs engagement period. Interested too in the trend of what now seems like longer courtships and longer engagements.

Maybe it was deliberate, because you don't want to skew the answers?

Anyway, there is one part in here I definitely want to comment on:

&gt; It's different enough that my coworkers, friends, and family comment on my mood, my attitude, and apparently my happiness in this regard is pretty outwardly noticeable.

I had this in my last relationship.

Which turned out to be an utter shit show, in the long run.

Now, I'm not saying yours will turn out that way, but this, in and of itself, doesn't really mean much.  

It sounds like you're still in the ""honeymoon"" phase of the relationship.  The fact that we call it that harkens back to those days you referenced, when people would get married quite quickly.

It is my opinion that you should be with someone long enough for that to wear off, before deciding you want to spend the rest of your lives together.

How long that takes varies a lot from couple to couple.

I also strongly advise living together before marrying.  I know many cultures &amp; religions have a big taboo against this, but what sense does it make to promise to do something for the rest of your life that you've literally never done before?";4;0.6666666666666667;[[0.96287537]];[[0.60077325]];0.9991;0.22899999999999998;0.732;0.039;0.8568;0.069;0.905;0.026000000000000002;0.147;0.17246420246420247;0.08882575757575756;0.08363844488844491

We were young, only 16/17, but we knew it was special. Everyone thought we were nuts, including ourselves, because who knows they’ll marry on their first date, especially at 16? We knew it but also knew things could change as we matured so we dated almost 6 years before getting married. We moved in together at 18 and lived as we would if we had that piece of paper. We shared everything and made sure we were as compatible as we felt. We’ve been together almost 20 years now and married 14, still madly in love and as sure as we were that first date.

I [24M] Have a serious crush on someone [25F] who is not my GF [21F] and it's driving me crazy...;t3_8cl7wo;5;"Hey folks...thank you so much for checking this out...I am SO sorry for the book you're about to read, but I need to vent to a third party... 


I am a 24M.  I have had quite an experience with dating, and unfortunately, every relationship I have ever been in has lasted at least 2 years.  All of them ending badly... I don't do flings, or short term stuff, even though I have no interest in marriage or children.  


I am currently with my girlfriend of almost 3 years... Things with us started rather shaky, since she was significantly younger than me, and relatively young at the time, but we got along very well. (She left a pseudo abusive guy of 2 years to be with me).  When we started dating, we established through several fights, that there were things about each other that were problematic for our relationship, so we worked on them, and things did improve.  


Over time, however I began feeling bored, and unfulfilled, since she doesn't have any hobbies but sleeping, and I felt like I had nothing in common with her.  I voiced this, and she tried things for a few days, before reverting back to scrolling on facebook for 3 hours a day and naps.  We had been together for around a year at this point.  By now I was in a pretty bad place, and just felt like I needed to get away from everything; (exes making problems, feeling like I was at a dead end) so I decided to join the military... 


This did not go over well with the GF, she was very displeased, as is completely understandable. Tension grew, and things got bad.  Constant fights, me questioning why I wanted to be with someone at all; let alone someone I don't have anything in common with...Depression for both of us, but I was set to leave in 5 months, so I figured I'd see if we could figure things out in that time. 


Then it happened.  I was promoted at work, and while doing rounds at other offices, I met who I will refer to as ""T"".  T was a very funny, and very attractive girl, and the two of us got along SO great.  We had a bunch in common and could talk about our hobbies (martial arts, reading, various movies, shows and music), but we were completely professional.  After a few months, it made me question everything about my relationship...If I could feel something for someone else, should I just break it off, and pursue? is it just a crush? don't leave a good thing?  I even talked to ""T"" about my relationship from time to time (water cooler convos) since we had become friends outside of work, and she seemed genuinely interested in my life, but had never hung out, only text.


Well I was getting ready to ship off, and in my mind, the best thing to do was break off everything I had; for everyone's best interest.  I ""Broke up"" with the girlfriend before shipping out, but she promised she'd wait even if we weren't together.  She wrote me all through basic training, and honestly, it was amazing.  She was so supportive and I can say she got me through a lot of hard times.  


While in my job training, I was able to text back and forth with my girlfriend, and it just felt like a long distance relationship gone right,  a lot of support, very endearing, minimal stress...I missed her, and things felt normal.  But then I would catch myself thinking about ""T"" from time to time... I vented to my family shortly before I left, about how strong of a crush I felt for another girl...(They absolutely ADORE my GF) and they agreed that being away from everything would probably put my true feelings into perspective.  


Talking with my GF every day was great, and kept me motivated...but one night, I get a text from ""T"" basically just asking if I'm doing alright, simple chit chat...and it just sparked an avalanche of emotion, I wanted to talk to her more...but she told me that she didn't want to cross boundaries with my current GF which I totally understood and respected her for being so respectful. 


So time passes by, eventually I end up sustaining some pretty gnarly injuries, after only being in for a year, and get sent home (Full retirement and all that jazz) So I'm getting ready to go home and start the next chapter of my life, and I know I'm going home to someone who really truly and genuinely loves me.  Our relationship picks right back up...she is so understanding of my physical limits, and mental issues as well; and has been the most amazing support I could ever ask for.  She's always so loving and affectionate, and I know this girl would be with me until the day I die if I asked her to...but that's the problem.  I don't feel the same way...I don't really know...I love her so much and care about her, but I don't feel an intense fire burning within me drawing me to her like a force unknown.  I don't want marriage in any way, the idea of legally being bound to someone that could potentially end up screwing me out of half my retirement forever turns me off...my parents just got divorced and it's financially ruined my father. 


We just don't click like we did in the very beginning...there's a lot of things that drive me insane about her; like her lack of drive, lack of independence, lack of interests in everything... It's like the color grey. Just very plain, doesn't stand out, but it goes so well with the flow it's hard to be upset with it.  I will elaborate. At 21 years old, she has a curfew (Very controlling parents) a tracker on her phone that her parents check, she is in school, but doesn't like her major, which she is doing because her mother pays for tuition so she has to do what she wants.  It drives me nuts that she doesn't have any control of her life and she is completely fine with it.  


So at this point I am home for a few months...im trying to push my GF into being more independent, and expose her to more things to maybe get some interests to rub off on her. When I get a random text from ""T"" saying that the next time im home, we should grab a drink and catch up...and once again my heart stops.  So we go back and forth a I tell her I'm home, and we schedule a night to hang out and get some drinks.  


I tell my GF and she's fine with this...she's a VERY jealous person, but understands that with my social issues...it's important for me to leave my solitary confinement from time to time.  She does not know that this girl had made me question my relationship, or anything about her, and I didn't know how to say anything about it so, I just told her it was a co-worker. 


We meet up...and my world officially flipped upside down. She is gorgeous. And The most career driven, mature, and fun conversations were had... I was talking to an adult, with a mission in life, and a plan to get there.  We hit it off, just as we had prior to me leaving.  It felt weird, but not in a good or bad way... I felt like I was cheating on my GF, because of how interested in this girl I was.  Nothing came of it... just a hug goodbye, and it was over. 


I didn't know what to think, I only knew that yes, I had a crush on a girl that was not my GF, and that it's normal to be infatuated with someone who is attractive and the idea of something new is exciting... Surely it would dissipate and I can continue trying to fix my relationship.  


Well that overcast grey was getting more and more cumbersome on my shoulders...just feeling like a routine was being engraved into the canyon of my life making it deeper and deeper, more difficult to manage.  Feeling like this is the rest of my life; forever. the same thing. every day.  This is marriage without the title. 


""T"" and I continued texting sporadically over the course of around a month when she asked to hang out again, since the weather was nice.  So I agreed, talked to the GF, who said okay, and to have fun... This was last week...and this is where the shit hits the fan... 


After spending pretty much all afternoon hanging out just talking about life, my experiences, her experiences, my likes, her likes, just getting to know each other... we decided to grab a bite to eat.  We sat at the table in a pretty cool restaurant for almost 4 hours...4 hours. There were moments when I asked if she wanted to go, and she would just look at me, get this little smile, kind of look down and shake her head... so we just kept talking, and talking...and a lot of topics came up...including some big hitters.  


She admitted to being pretty upset when she found out I had a girlfriend when we had first met; like when I mentioned my S/O she thought to herself DAMN. She had thought we had broken up before I shipped off, Since we had talked a bit about what was going on at the time, and she had been worried about me and thought about me often while I was away... 


So I knew she had feelings at some point too; which is crazy to know, and to be perfectly honest, made me feel SO warm and fuzzy inside that the things I felt were reciprocated.  Our conversations were light hearted, but so truthful and honest, I confessed to being attracted, and told her had I not been in a relationship, I would more than likely ask her out, to which she became awkward In that embarrassed blushing kind of way. and stated later on that if I didn't have a GF that she would want to date me... 


This was all in a friendly tone...there was no pressure, it was so relaxed, and just an honest conversation two adults having about their emotions.  While it was nice and I enjoyed it, there was one part that has me overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety. 


We talked about my relationship...and how things had been, to how they are now...and she asked why I am with her, because there ARE reason I am... And mostly I told her because I feel like I'm all she has...she's depressed and stressed with school and parents, and if I leave her, she will be completely and totally alone...Which would kill me... but then I realized that I am also PETRIFIED of being alone..and I feel like nobody in the world would ever love a broken, disabled guy like me who is limited in several ways. 


We started driving back to get my car which was parked elsewhere, since she drove, having knowing the area better.  We were driving off when I realized we were driving the wrong was, so I corrected her, we laughed it off, and she began kind of racing to get back on track.  I told her to slow down, so we could talk more, which she grinned and slowed down.  We got to the parking lot, she parked next to the car, and said damn...you were right...I should have driven slower... 


it make me feel like she really did enjoy spending time with me and maybe really does like me... We listened to music for another 45 minutes in the car; just dancing and singing along like a couple idiots in high school... Then It became a tad late...so we hugged goodnight and that was that...my head and heart have been fighting ever since. 


I am afraid I'm just looking for a safety net to jump to before breaking it off with my GF because I'm unfulfilled but too frightened to be alone, so I'm trying to find something; anything.  I know this isn't totally true, but my head is screwy. I am also scared that ""T"" may feel that's what I'm doing and if I were to leave my GF to explore this opportunity, I would get burned on both ends...


Which brings me to my final point...""T"" is NOT a princess needed to be saved.  She's a fighter, a career driven, independent woman who is absolutely gorgeous and brilliant.  She doesn't have a long emotional relationship history; usually doesn't date and has admitted to breaking things off when she felt things were getting too serious because she liked someone a lot; which scared her... I am not looking for lifelong commitment, but I enjoy companionship that has some stability... and I am very much interested in knowing what would happen if this girl were a bigger part of my life. 


What the heck is wrong with me, I am so sorry if I am an asshole, I know I don't feel the right things, and don't make good choices; If I had never opted to hang out with ""T"" none of this would be an issue but what if it's something that needed to happen... I don't know if im looking for advice, maybe this was just a vent...but if anyone has anything to say, I appreciate it :( Heart is just on a roller coaster right now. 


Sorry for the freaking book.

TL:DR 
Have an amazing girlfriend, but someone else has recently become much more appealing. r.i.p. emotional foundation. ";3;"Honestly I think what you’re doing now is considered an emotional affair, which is almost just as bad, to me, as physically cheating. You keep saying how you feel guilty, so you know you agree that what you are doing is wrong. Stop being with your girlfriend out of pity. She deserves someone who WANTS to be with her and you deserve to be with someone that you WANT to be with. 

I know that relationships go through ups and downs, but at the end of the day, if you are having THIS much anxiety over whether or not to stay with your girlfriend? That right there is enough to break up in my mind. You’ve lost the foundation. You have grown into different people. Of course you’ll always love her, but just because you love someone, doesn’t mean they’re your life partner.

I don't feel the same way...I don't really know...I love her so much and care about her, but I don't feel an intense fire burning within me drawing me to her like a force unknown.  I don't want marriage in any way, the idea of legally being bound to someone that could potentially end up screwing me out of half my retirement forever turns me off...my parents just got divorced and it's financially ruined my father. 


We just don't click like we did in the very beginning...there's a lot of things that drive me insane about her; like her lack of drive, lack of independence, lack of interests in everything... It's like the color grey. Just very plain, doesn't stand out, but it goes so well with the flow it's hard to be upset with it.  I will elaborate. At 21 years old, she has a curfew (Very controlling parents) a tracker on her phone that her parents check, she is in school, but doesn't like her major, which she is doing because her mother pays for tuition so she has to do what she wants.  It drives me nuts that she doesn't have any control of her life and she is completely fine with it.  


So at this point I am home for a few months...im trying to push my GF into being more independent, and expose her to more things to maybe get some interests to rub off on her. When I get a random text from ""T"" saying that the next time im home, we should grab a drink and catch up...and once again my heart stops.  So we go back and forth a I tell her I'm home, and we schedule a night to hang out and get some drinks.  


I tell my GF and she's fine with this...she's a VERY jealous person, but understands that with my social issues...it's important for me to leave my solitary confinement from time to time.  She does not know that this girl had made me question my relationship, or anything about her, and I didn't know how to say anything about it so, I just told her it was a co-worker. 


We meet up...and my world officially flipped upside down. She is gorgeous. And The most career driven, mature, and fun conversations were had... I was talking to an adult, with a mission in life, and a plan to get there.  We hit it off, just as we had prior to me leaving.  It felt weird, but not in a good or bad way... I felt like I was cheating on my GF, because of how interested in this girl I was.  Nothing came of it... just a hug goodbye, and it was over. 


I didn't know what to think, I only knew that yes, I had a crush on a girl that was not my GF, and that it's normal to be infatuated with someone who is attractive and the idea of something new is exciting... Surely it would dissipate and I can continue trying to fix my relationship.  


Well that overcast grey was getting more and more cumbersome on my shoulders...just feeling like a routine was being engraved into the canyon of my life making it deeper and deeper, more difficult to manage.  Feeling like this is the rest of my life; forever. the same thing. every day.  This is marriage without the title. 


""T"" and I continued texting sporadically over the course of around a month when she asked to hang out again, since the weather was nice.  So I agreed, talked to the GF, who said okay, and to have fun... This was last week...and this is where the shit hits the fan... 


After spending pretty much all afternoon hanging out just talking about life, my experiences, her experiences, my likes, her likes, just getting to know each other... we decided to grab a bite to eat.  We sat at the table in a pretty cool restaurant for almost 4 hours...4 hours. There were moments when I asked if she wanted to go, and she would just look at me, get this little smile, kind of look down and shake her head... so we just kept talking, and talking...and a lot of topics came up...including some big hitters.  


She admitted to being pretty upset when she found out I had a girlfriend when we had first met; like when I mentioned my S/O she thought to herself DAMN. She had thought we had broken up before I shipped off, Since we had talked a bit about what was going on at the time, and she had been worried about me and thought about me often while I was away... 


So I knew she had feelings at some point too; which is crazy to know, and to be perfectly honest, made me feel SO warm and fuzzy inside that the things I felt were reciprocated.  Our conversations were light hearted, but so truthful and honest, I confessed to being attracted, and told her had I not been in a relationship, I would more than likely ask her out, to which she became awkward In that embarrassed blushing kind of way. and stated later on that if I didn't have a GF that she would want to date me... 


This was all in a friendly tone...there was no pressure, it was so relaxed, and just an honest conversation two adults having about their emotions.  While it was nice and I enjoyed it, there was one part that has me overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety. 


We talked about my relationship...and how things had been, to how they are now...and she asked why I am with her, because there ARE reason I am... And mostly I told her because I feel like I'm all she has...she's depressed and stressed with school and parents, and if I leave her, she will be completely and totally alone...Which would kill me... but then I realized that I am also PETRIFIED of being alone..and I feel like nobody in the world would ever love a broken, disabled guy like me who is limited in several ways. 


We started driving back to get my car which was parked elsewhere, since she drove, having knowing the area better.  We were driving off when I realized we were driving the wrong was, so I corrected her, we laughed it off, and she began kind of racing to get back on track.  I told her to slow down, so we could talk more, which she grinned and slowed down.  We got to the parking lot, she parked next to the car, and said damn...you were right...I should have driven slower... 


it make me feel like she really did enjoy spending time with me and maybe really does like me... We listened to music for another 45 minutes in the car; just dancing and singing along like a couple idiots in high school... Then It became a tad late...so we hugged goodnight and that was that...my head and heart have been fighting ever since. 


I am afraid I'm just looking for a safety net to jump to before breaking it off with my GF because I'm unfulfilled but too frightened to be alone, so I'm trying to find something; anything.  I know this isn't totally true, but my head is screwy. I am also scared that ""T"" may feel that's what I'm doing and if I were to leave my GF to explore this opportunity, I would get burned on both ends...


Which brings me to my final point...""T"" is NOT a princess needed to be saved.  She's a fighter, a career driven, independent woman who is absolutely gorgeous and brilliant.  She doesn't have a long emotional relationship history; usually doesn't date and has admitted to breaking things off when she felt things were getting too serious because she liked someone a lot; which scared her... I am not looking for lifelong commitment, but I enjoy companionship that has some stability... and I am very much interested in knowing what would happen if this girl were a bigger part of my life. 


What the heck is wrong with me, I am so sorry if I am an asshole, I know I don't feel the right things, and don't make good choices; If I had never opted to hang out with ""T"" none of this would be an issue but what if it's something that needed to happen... I don't know if im looking for advice, maybe this was just a vent...but if anyone has anything to say, I appreciate it :( Heart is just on a roller coaster right now. 


Sorry for the freaking book.

TL:DR 
Have an amazing girlfriend, but someone else has recently become much more appealing. r.i.p. emotional foundation. ";3;"Yes, I think this can be considered an emotional affair depending on how you view it. I can sort of understand your situation. I did have crushes here and there but I never confessed them or entertained them.
Please end things with your current girlfriend, you are wasting your time and hers. It might not seem like the best idea, but trust me it is.

I [24M] Have a serious crush on someone [25F] who is not my GF [21F] and it's driving me crazy...;t3_8cl7wo;5;"Hey folks...thank you so much for checking this out...I am SO sorry for the book you're about to read, but I need to vent to a third party... 


I am a 24M.  I have had quite an experience with dating, and unfortunately, every relationship I have ever been in has lasted at least 2 years.  All of them ending badly... I don't do flings, or short term stuff, even though I have no interest in marriage or children.  


I am currently with my girlfriend of almost 3 years... Things with us started rather shaky, since she was significantly younger than me, and relatively young at the time, but we got along very well. (She left a pseudo abusive guy of 2 years to be with me).  When we started dating, we established through several fights, that there were things about each other that were problematic for our relationship, so we worked on them, and things did improve.  


Over time, however I began feeling bored, and unfulfilled, since she doesn't have any hobbies but sleeping, and I felt like I had nothing in common with her.  I voiced this, and she tried things for a few days, before reverting back to scrolling on facebook for 3 hours a day and naps.  We had been together for around a year at this point.  By now I was in a pretty bad place, and just felt like I needed to get away from everything; (exes making problems, feeling like I was at a dead end) so I decided to join the military... 


This did not go over well with the GF, she was very displeased, as is completely understandable. Tension grew, and things got bad.  Constant fights, me questioning why I wanted to be with someone at all; let alone someone I don't have anything in common with...Depression for both of us, but I was set to leave in 5 months, so I figured I'd see if we could figure things out in that time. 


Then it happened.  I was promoted at work, and while doing rounds at other offices, I met who I will refer to as ""T"".  T was a very funny, and very attractive girl, and the two of us got along SO great.  We had a bunch in common and could talk about our hobbies (martial arts, reading, various movies, shows and music), but we were completely professional.  After a few months, it made me question everything about my relationship...If I could feel something for someone else, should I just break it off, and pursue? is it just a crush? don't leave a good thing?  I even talked to ""T"" about my relationship from time to time (water cooler convos) since we had become friends outside of work, and she seemed genuinely interested in my life, but had never hung out, only text.


Well I was getting ready to ship off, and in my mind, the best thing to do was break off everything I had; for everyone's best interest.  I ""Broke up"" with the girlfriend before shipping out, but she promised she'd wait even if we weren't together.  She wrote me all through basic training, and honestly, it was amazing.  She was so supportive and I can say she got me through a lot of hard times.  


While in my job training, I was able to text back and forth with my girlfriend, and it just felt like a long distance relationship gone right,  a lot of support, very endearing, minimal stress...I missed her, and things felt normal.  But then I would catch myself thinking about ""T"" from time to time... I vented to my family shortly before I left, about how strong of a crush I felt for another girl...(They absolutely ADORE my GF) and they agreed that being away from everything would probably put my true feelings into perspective.  


Talking with my GF every day was great, and kept me motivated...but one night, I get a text from ""T"" basically just asking if I'm doing alright, simple chit chat...and it just sparked an avalanche of emotion, I wanted to talk to her more...but she told me that she didn't want to cross boundaries with my current GF which I totally understood and respected her for being so respectful. 


So time passes by, eventually I end up sustaining some pretty gnarly injuries, after only being in for a year, and get sent home (Full retirement and all that jazz) So I'm getting ready to go home and start the next chapter of my life, and I know I'm going home to someone who really truly and genuinely loves me.  Our relationship picks right back up...she is so understanding of my physical limits, and mental issues as well; and has been the most amazing support I could ever ask for.  She's always so loving and affectionate, and I know this girl would be with me until the day I die if I asked her to...but that's the problem.  I don't feel the same way...I don't really know...I love her so much and care about her, but I don't feel an intense fire burning within me drawing me to her like a force unknown.  I don't want marriage in any way, the idea of legally being bound to someone that could potentially end up screwing me out of half my retirement forever turns me off...my parents just got divorced and it's financially ruined my father. 


We just don't click like we did in the very beginning...there's a lot of things that drive me insane about her; like her lack of drive, lack of independence, lack of interests in everything... It's like the color grey. Just very plain, doesn't stand out, but it goes so well with the flow it's hard to be upset with it.  I will elaborate. At 21 years old, she has a curfew (Very controlling parents) a tracker on her phone that her parents check, she is in school, but doesn't like her major, which she is doing because her mother pays for tuition so she has to do what she wants.  It drives me nuts that she doesn't have any control of her life and she is completely fine with it.  


So at this point I am home for a few months...im trying to push my GF into being more independent, and expose her to more things to maybe get some interests to rub off on her. When I get a random text from ""T"" saying that the next time im home, we should grab a drink and catch up...and once again my heart stops.  So we go back and forth a I tell her I'm home, and we schedule a night to hang out and get some drinks.

TL:DR 
Have an amazing girlfriend, but someone else has recently become much more appealing. r.i.p. emotional foundation. ";3;"You should keep in mind that you cannot ride two horses simultaneously as that is not possible. Attraction towards opposite sex is normal whether you are in the relationship or not but that does not mean that you should act on it. 

You should make sure that you do not cheat on your girlfriend whether it is an emotional one or physical one. Control your feelings and do things to invest yourself into your relationship. Stay away from your crush until you get the confidence that you can handle yourself around her and you would not make your girlfriend jealous. Focus on your relationship with your girlfriend and these feelings will go away.

We got to the parking lot, she parked next to the car, and said damn...you were right...I should have driven slower... 


it make me feel like she really did enjoy spending time with me and maybe really does like me... We listened to music for another 45 minutes in the car; just dancing and singing along like a couple idiots in high school... Then It became a tad late...so we hugged goodnight and that was that...my head and heart have been fighting ever since. 


I am afraid I'm just looking for a safety net to jump to before breaking it off with my GF because I'm unfulfilled but too frightened to be alone, so I'm trying to find something; anything.  I know this isn't totally true, but my head is screwy. I am also scared that ""T"" may feel that's what I'm doing and if I were to leave my GF to explore this opportunity, I would get burned on both ends...


Which brings me to my final point...""T"" is NOT a princess needed to be saved.  She's a fighter, a career driven, independent woman who is absolutely gorgeous and brilliant.  She doesn't have a long emotional relationship history; usually doesn't date and has admitted to breaking things off when she felt things were getting too serious because she liked someone a lot; which scared her... I am not looking for lifelong commitment, but I enjoy companionship that has some stability... and I am very much interested in knowing what would happen if this girl were a bigger part of my life. 


What the heck is wrong with me, I am so sorry if I am an asshole, I know I don't feel the right things, and don't make good choices; If I had never opted to hang out with ""T"" none of this would be an issue but what if it's something that needed to happen... I don't know if im looking for advice, maybe this was just a vent...but if anyone has anything to say, I appreciate it :( Heart is just on a roller coaster right now. 


Sorry for the freaking book.

TL:DR 
Have an amazing girlfriend, but someone else has recently become much more appealing. r.i.p. emotional foundation. ";3;Outside looking in, it seems like you already know deep within what is the best for you. In all honesty, you should take time away from both ladies. Don’t settle for a banana for the sake of it being a fruit, when in reality you like blueberries.  it’s okay to be a little selfish and take a moment back to reflect what truly matters to you and your life ;1;0.33333333333333337;[[0.95824072]];[[0.38008569]];0.9997;0.175;0.7190000000000001;0.107;0.9259;0.23399999999999999;0.73;0.036000000000000004;-0.13;0.12094744094744095;0.11607142857142858;0.004876012376012373
I [24M] Have a serious crush on someone [25F] who is not my GF [21F] and it's driving me crazy...;t3_8cl7wo;5;"Hey folks...thank you so much for checking this out...I am SO sorry for the book you're about to read, but I need to vent to a third party... 


I am a 24M.  I have had quite an experience with dating, and unfortunately, every relationship I have ever been in has lasted at least 2 years.  All of them ending badly... I don't do flings, or short term stuff, even though I have no interest in marriage or children.  


I am currently with my girlfriend of almost 3 years... Things with us started rather shaky, since she was significantly younger than me, and relatively young at the time, but we got along very well. (She left a pseudo abusive guy of 2 years to be with me).  When we started dating, we established through several fights, that there were things about each other that were problematic for our relationship, so we worked on them, and things did improve.  


Over time, however I began feeling bored, and unfulfilled, since she doesn't have any hobbies but sleeping, and I felt like I had nothing in common with her.  I voiced this, and she tried things for a few days, before reverting back to scrolling on facebook for 3 hours a day and naps.  We had been together for around a year at this point.  By now I was in a pretty bad place, and just felt like I needed to get away from everything; (exes making problems, feeling like I was at a dead end) so I decided to join the military... 


This did not go over well with the GF, she was very displeased, as is completely understandable. Tension grew, and things got bad.  Constant fights, me questioning why I wanted to be with someone at all; let alone someone I don't have anything in common with...Depression for both of us, but I was set to leave in 5 months, so I figured I'd see if we could figure things out in that time. 


Then it happened.  I was promoted at work, and while doing rounds at other offices, I met who I will refer to as ""T"".  T was a very funny, and very attractive girl, and the two of us got along SO great.  We had a bunch in common and could talk about our hobbies (martial arts, reading, various movies, shows and music), but we were completely professional.  After a few months, it made me question everything about my relationship...If I could feel something for someone else, should I just break it off, and pursue? is it just a crush? don't leave a good thing?  I even talked to ""T"" about my relationship from time to time (water cooler convos) since we had become friends outside of work, and she seemed genuinely interested in my life, but had never hung out, only text.


Well I was getting ready to ship off, and in my mind, the best thing to do was break off everything I had; for everyone's best interest.  I ""Broke up"" with the girlfriend before shipping out, but she promised she'd wait even if we weren't together.  She wrote me all through basic training, and honestly, it was amazing.  She was so supportive and I can say she got me through a lot of hard times.  


While in my job training, I was able to text back and forth with my girlfriend, and it just felt like a long distance relationship gone right,  a lot of support, very endearing, minimal stress...I missed her, and things felt normal.  But then I would catch myself thinking about ""T"" from time to time... I vented to my family shortly before I left, about how strong of a crush I felt for another girl...(They absolutely ADORE my GF) and they agreed that being away from everything would probably put my true feelings into perspective.  


Talking with my GF every day was great, and kept me motivated...but one night, I get a text from ""T"" basically just asking if I'm doing alright, simple chit chat...and it just sparked an avalanche of emotion, I wanted to talk to her more...but she told me that she didn't want to cross boundaries with my current GF which I totally understood and respected her for being so respectful. 


So time passes by, eventually I end up sustaining some pretty gnarly injuries, after only being in for a year, and get sent home (Full retirement and all that jazz) So I'm getting ready to go home and start the next chapter of my life, and I know I'm going home to someone who really truly and genuinely loves me.  Our relationship picks right back up...she is so understanding of my physical limits, and mental issues as well; and has been the most amazing support I could ever ask for.  She's always so loving and affectionate, and I know this girl would be with me until the day I die if I asked her to...but that's the problem.  I don't feel the same way...I don't really know...I love her so much and care about her, but I don't feel an intense fire burning within me drawing me to her like a force unknown.  I don't want marriage in any way, the idea of legally being bound to someone that could potentially end up screwing me out of half my retirement forever turns me off...my parents just got divorced and it's financially ruined my father. 


We just don't click like we did in the very beginning...there's a lot of things that drive me insane about her; like her lack of drive, lack of independence, lack of interests in everything... It's like the color grey. Just very plain, doesn't stand out, but it goes so well with the flow it's hard to be upset with it.  I will elaborate. At 21 years old, she has a curfew (Very controlling parents) a tracker on her phone that her parents check, she is in school, but doesn't like her major, which she is doing because her mother pays for tuition so she has to do what she wants.  It drives me nuts that she doesn't have any control of her life and she is completely fine with it.  


So at this point I am home for a few months...im trying to push my GF into being more independent, and expose her to more things to maybe get some interests to rub off on her. When I get a random text from ""T"" saying that the next time im home, we should grab a drink and catch up...and once again my heart stops.  So we go back and forth a I tell her I'm home, and we schedule a night to hang out and get some drinks.  


I tell my GF and she's fine with this...she's a VERY jealous person, but understands that with my social issues...it's important for me to leave my solitary confinement from time to time.  She does not know that this girl had made me question my relationship, or anything about her, and I didn't know how to say anything about it so, I just told her it was a co-worker. 


We meet up...and my world officially flipped upside down. She is gorgeous. And The most career driven, mature, and fun conversations were had... I was talking to an adult, with a mission in life, and a plan to get there.  We hit it off, just as we had prior to me leaving.  It felt weird, but not in a good or bad way... I felt like I was cheating on my GF, because of how interested in this girl I was.  Nothing came of it... just a hug goodbye, and it was over. 


I didn't know what to think, I only knew that yes, I had a crush on a girl that was not my GF, and that it's normal to be infatuated with someone who is attractive and the idea of something new is exciting... Surely it would dissipate and I can continue trying to fix my relationship.  


Well that overcast grey was getting more and more cumbersome on my shoulders...just feeling like a routine was being engraved into the canyon of my life making it deeper and deeper, more difficult to manage.  Feeling like this is the rest of my life; forever. the same thing. every day.  This is marriage without the title. 


""T"" and I continued texting sporadically over the course of around a month when she asked to hang out again, since the weather was nice.  So I agreed, talked to the GF, who said okay, and to have fun... This was last week...and this is where the shit hits the fan... 


After spending pretty much all afternoon hanging out just talking about life, my experiences, her experiences, my likes, her likes, just getting to know each other... we decided to grab a bite to eat.  We sat at the table in a pretty cool restaurant for almost 4 hours...4 hours. There were moments when I asked if she wanted to go, and she would just look at me, get this little smile, kind of look down and shake her head... so we just kept talking, and talking...and a lot of topics came up...including some big hitters.  


She admitted to being pretty upset when she found out I had a girlfriend when we had first met; like when I mentioned my S/O she thought to herself DAMN. She had thought we had broken up before I shipped off, Since we had talked a bit about what was going on at the time, and she had been worried about me and thought about me often while I was away... 


So I knew she had feelings at some point too; which is crazy to know, and to be perfectly honest, made me feel SO warm and fuzzy inside that the things I felt were reciprocated.  Our conversations were light hearted, but so truthful and honest, I confessed to being attracted, and told her had I not been in a relationship, I would more than likely ask her out, to which she became awkward In that embarrassed blushing kind of way. and stated later on that if I didn't have a GF that she would want to date me... 


This was all in a friendly tone...there was no pressure, it was so relaxed, and just an honest conversation two adults having about their emotions.  While it was nice and I enjoyed it, there was one part that has me overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety. 


We talked about my relationship...and how things had been, to how they are now...and she asked why I am with her, because there ARE reason I am... And mostly I told her because I feel like I'm all she has...she's depressed and stressed with school and parents, and if I leave her, she will be completely and totally alone...Which would kill me... but then I realized that I am also PETRIFIED of being alone..and I feel like nobody in the world would ever love a broken, disabled guy like me who is limited in several ways. 


We started driving back to get my car which was parked elsewhere, since she drove, having knowing the area better.  We were driving off when I realized we were driving the wrong was, so I corrected her, we laughed it off, and she began kind of racing to get back on track.  I told her to slow down, so we could talk more, which she grinned and slowed down.

TL:DR 
Have an amazing girlfriend, but someone else has recently become much more appealing. r.i.p. emotional foundation. ";3;"Honestly, sometimes people want advice. Sometimes they want to commiserate. Sometimes they want license or validation to do what they feel. Almost like they are asking permission. 

If you can treat her with respect and do your best not to hurt her, it sounds like you've made up your mind. 

I wouldn't feel bad about that, even if it will be sticky and require some steely character. Maybe that is the thing worth saying? Do what you feel, but handle it with honor and integrity. 

If you do that, I think you'll have to ask other people less going forward. ";0;0.0;[[0.95596364]];[[0.38853973]];0.9997;0.175;0.7190000000000001;0.107;0.9553;0.24;0.76;0.0;-0.172;0.12094744094744095;0.15138888888888893;-0.030441447941447982
Boyfriend with a gambling problem- Help!;t3_8cxvj5;3;"My (25f) boyfriend (27m) of 2 years needs some serious help. Things with us have been pretty amazing for the 2 years we have been together. Within the last 6 months I have found out he has an addiction to gambling.  He's always tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal however recently I've realized it is a very big deal and very serious. He's owed me a large some of money for a little while as I had to pay our rent and he hasn't been able to pay it back-for a few months. It was annoying but didn't concern me that much as I knew I would eventually get it and he's been working two jobs to try and sort things out.

Shit hit the fan this last week however. He had lost his bank card and asked me to borrow 20 to be able to go for a meal with a family member. So I agreed however on the day I was being lazy and decided to just give him my bank card as I wasn't going anywhere anyway.  
He was gone for a few hours and I had asked him to get groceries on the way home. A little while later I thought wow this is taking forever what on earth is he doing! So I checked my online banking and he had taken out 4 different amounts of money totalling 100. So immediately being pissed off - I messaged him and asked how much money are you spending on groceries? Only to get a reply of 'sorry'

Let me start off my saying my heart literally felt like it stopped. I knew exactly what had happened. But pressed on- I asked what are you sorry for? 

He messaged me back saying he had taken 100 of my money and gambled it away and lost control. I immediately called him to which he didn't answer the phone and then called my bank to cancel my card- as I was panicking. 

He came back home hysterical and broke down saying he needs help and doesn't know what to do. I contacted his family and they have given me all of the money he owed and took. They are now in the process of trying to get him into some sort of help/ rehab program for it. 

I think this is rock bottom for him. I'm not sure what to do. I don't think that the way he has behaved is him as a person and I want to be supportive- but at the same time I'm very scared of what the future could hold for us. 

I'm just looking for advice on what I should do at this point. And perhaps if anyone has experiencing over coming this addiction advice on what they had to do. 

Part of me is hurt for what happened and scared this could be a major red flag of what is to come. But at the same time I do love him immensely and haven't felt this way about anyone ever before. 

Any advice would be very much appreciated . 

Thank you.

TL;DR- my 27m boyfriend has a gambling addiction and has stolen money from me. He's going to seek help for the addiction but I don't know if I should be supportive or scared.  TL;DR  **bold**  ";2;I dated an addicted gambler.  I left because he didn't want help. He lied to me constantly, when it came to gambling and money.  After I paid rent one month and the gas and electric the next month, I was done.  I thought he had hit rock bottom so many times, but he never did.  If he really does want to get help, support him.  But if this just keeps happening over and over, I say leave. Leaving my ex was the best thing I did for me.  We have been apart for about a year now.  I still talk to him a lot, but am so disgusted by his gambling problem that I just have zero sympathy for him.  Since then, I did met an amazing guy.  It hurt to leave my ex, but it is never going to get better unless he gets help.  Like i said, if your bf wants help, support him, if he doesn't, run.  The lying, cheating, and stealing will only get worse.  ;2;1.0;[[0.98888586]];[[0.62284333]];-0.917;0.08800000000000001;0.8;0.11199999999999999;-0.8526;0.153;0.632;0.21600000000000003;0.038999999999999986;0.005896307798481706;0.09230769230769233;-0.08641138450921063

TL;DR- my 27m boyfriend has a gambling addiction and has stolen money from me. He's going to seek help for the addiction but I don't know if I should be supportive or scared.  TL;DR  **bold**  ";2;"I think it's fair to be both supportive, but scared at the same time. You don't really know what to expect from all this, and I'm sure it's all probably happening very fast for you. 

But if I weighed out the pros and cons of this situation, it looks to me like there are certainly a lot more pros than cons. He's getting help now, and his family is supportive and willing to help lift him up to get him back to where he needs to be. He obviously still loves you: he was honest with you about what had happened, and it's clear he sees that he has a problem. 

My grandparents were abusive gamblers when they were alive. They lived across the globe from us, but my dad used to send them money often, and it was clear that they always spent it gambling. It was hard on my mom since my dad was the sole provider and my mom stayed at home, so that helpless feeling of not being able or knowing what to do about our situation weighed down heavy on her. They passed a year or two ago within a month of one another, but even then it was a tough time for the family knowing how much debt needed to be repaid amongst their children. 

The best thing I think you can do at this point is to do your best to be supportive of your boyfriend's recovery. Try your best not to push, but at the same time make sure he's getting all the help he needs. In order for your relationship to flourish, he needs to get back on track with his finances, even if that means he gets involved with how the numbers work regarding bills, saving, rent, budgets, etc. Maybe you could even work towards planning a nice trip someplace if you're able to get your finances in order. Give yourselves a goal to work towards, so that he can focus on recovery instead of his bad habits.

How do I [30F] get my twins father [32M] see that me getting upset about being called names isn't the issue. It's the name calling.;t3_8d0fr1;3;"We aren't together anymore but we see and spend time with each other regularly because of our kids. When we're talking or arguing sometimes he'll say things like ""you're a psycho if you think that"" or ""you have to be stupid to do that"". I think it's completely unnecessary to say things like that whether you mean it or not, and I often take it as him calling me those things. When i ask him not to do it he tells me not to be a snowflake and says things like that wouldn't upset me if I wasn't so sensitive. Usually him calling me a snowflake and telling me I shouldn't be upset makes me even more upset and then I start calling him names. Obvioualy that isn't okay but I get so frustrated! We want to get along but struggle so much lately. We know if we can't figure out how to change this we won't be able to be around the kids together and neither of us wants that. We're going to counselling soon (currently on a waiting list) but I'm doubtful it will help if I can't even get him to understand this. Am I wrong? Do I need go toughen up? If not, how do I get him to see that?


TL;DR I want my twins dad to understand why it isn't okay to call me names, whether he's trying to be mean or just half ass insinuating it.. Or is it okay? ";1;"Step 1: Don't call him names. That only reinforces to him that it's okay. Doesn't matter how frustrated you were. Your twins should understand why it's not okay for either of you to call the other names. 

Step 2: *""I really don't appreciate you calling me names. If that continues, I am going to have to distance myself from you. I don't want to do that, so can you please treat me with more respect. I will do the same and stop calling you names as well.""*

Then the most important part of that, stick to your word. If he continues disrespecting you, distance yourself. If he keeps doing it, distance yourself further. Keep doing that until the only place left to go is not speaking to him unless it's about the children only.

No, he shouldn't be calling you names.  And he *definitely* shouldn't be planning on using that tactic with the kids when they disagree with him, which is hopefully something the counselor will be able to convey.  But whether he's consciously aware of it or not, part of the reason he keeps doing it is because it changes the argument from whatever you were talking about to the name-calling.  You need to stop letting that happen and keep the focus on what you're actually supposed to be discussing.";2;2.0;[[0.97581717]];[[0.74756163]];-0.9369;0.096;0.769;0.134;-0.7003;0.025;0.887;0.08800000000000001;0.024999999999999998;-0.10208333333333333;0.1875;-0.2895833333333333

He sounds overly judgmental. Calling someone you at least once cared for by hurtful names indicates some judgmental tendencies. 

Even if you were a psycho, idiot, snowflake (?) - calling you names wouldn't help. And those are usually exaggerated words. 

You will have to stand up for yourself in therapy, and then to keep it going. How you think, feel, perceive things, judge them... you have to own all of that. Be ready to stand up for it, or maybe even hear something that makes you change your mind about some of it.

But that won't be in name-calling sessions, or shouldn't be. I find that a name-calling session, no matter how it triggers you, and no matter whether you can keep completely out of it or not... is better for learning about the other person. 

Bring some self-confidence to your therapy, but let him be aggressive at first, if that is how it goes. 

Be willing to see what he sees, but only if he stops being hurtful. 

Or hope your therapist has some skills. ";2;2.0;[[0.94845051]];[[0.73757169]];-0.9369;0.096;0.769;0.134;-0.8907;0.077;0.7979999999999999;0.125;0.009999999999999995;-0.10208333333333333;0.06166666666666666;-0.16375

On Friday I was reading headlines out of the local paper. There was study showing 7 drinks is healthy, local women are selling meth, and trump wants back in on the TPP.  I commented 'that will never happen' and he slams his hands down, he stands up, gets his coat, and storms out.
He's yelling I'm sick of hearing about politics, I'm sick of you having to comment on every little thing in the news and I'm never voting again! WOW.
I explained to him emphatically that I don't comment on politics,  I read one sentence. The day before I watched tv for 2 hours because the FBI raided Cohen and I never said a word to him! In fact I hadn't even watch the news for the last 2 months...because I was sick of it too.
He raged on me about 4 months ago over something his sister overheard me whisper to him. We're at a restaurant with his sister and friend who was buying us dinner.

My [18F] boyfriend [18M] has drastically become more busy and I'm finding it hard to not feel neglected. I want to be understanding, but how can I deal with these feelings?;t3_8cmvb4;2;"I'm sorry if this is a giant mess of a post but I'm really struggling to articulate the events and my own feelings. I also apologise if this sounds dumb, but it's my first relationship and I have no idea what to do. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year. In the first year of our relationship, we were inseparable, spending almost every minute of every day together. In the beginning of our relationship, he was also the more clingy partner, and because I find it hard to give my full trust to people, it took me a while to warm up to his level. He would always want to be texting or calling or face-timing if we were not physically together, would get upset if i did not reply straight away and replied a few minutes later (as he felt as if i had left the conversation rudely), felt sad when i wasn't holding his hand because i wasn't too used to it at first etc. 

Since around the 1 year mark, its sort of like the tables have turned. A few months ago, we started spending less time together, mostly because we had a long break before college started and he wanted to hang out with friends, play games etc. I missed him in those days, but I was completely fine with it and i also took time off to catch up with friends and go out. Then he took a casual job where he worked 9-5 for a few days a week just to earn some money. We progressively began to spend less and less time together, but it was all understandable. Now, since we don't go to the same college and live about 1 hr from each other, we barely get to see each other on a weekly basis. When college first began, we both made effort to travel to the other person's college when we had free time, so we could study together and just spend time with each other. There came a period of time where on weekends, where we usually met halfway to study at the city library, he did not feel bothered to come out to the city and so I travelled to the library closest to him, which ultimately meant travelling took around 1 and a 1/2 hours. I didn't complain and didn't feel bothered by the travel, mostly because I was more concerned about seeing him. Then, I would often find myself texting him and waiting a few hours for a reply, constantly checking my phone because previously, his replies were instant or as instant as they could be. I ruled out the possibility that he was busy as he was often ""active"" on facebook, sending snapchats, or tagging people on facebook. There was even a time where we were face-timing, and while he was watching a clip on youtube i messaged him asking him about something. Even after i heard his notification sound go off, he made the excuse that he did not see or hear my message after not replying for 10 minutes. It sounds really petty, but in comparison to the way that it used to be previously in our relationship, I can't help but feel as if something is not right. 

Now, we're both in our exam periods and it's been incredibly hard for me as these moments have accumulated for a few months. Due to his exams, we barely text and he often leaves me hanging even after he initiates conversation. It's gotten to the point where i no longer initiate text him a lot during the day because he often does not reply after a few messages. We had a talk the other day where he explained to me that he has been employed for four casual jobs which has cut down our physical time together to one afternoon a week. I totally understand his ambition, and know that its important to him that he has a job and spends time studying to do well in college. But I also feel very neglected and feel as if we are no longer as close as we used to be, and it honestly seems as if he has no will to make a little bit of time for me during the day. When i spoke to him about this, he said that he felt as if i would be understanding that we would not be able to meet up or see each other as often as we used to and yes i do i completely understand. I told him that i wasnt asking of much, i just wanted him to help me see that he was thinking of me throughout the day, as his lack of communication with me made me feel very distant from him. He argued that he felt as if he had messaged enough.

I really don't know what to do or how to feel. I have been having an internal battle with myself as I know that i should be respectful of his life and his ambition and that its childish and clingy for me to feel this way, but relative to the way that our relationship has always been I can't help but feel as if he's not the same person that I've been dating for the last year. 

TLDR: Boyfriend has become very busy with work and university and we barely get to spend time together, in comparison to the past where we were inseparable. He does not make an active effort to text or communicate with me and I feel very neglected. How do i deal with these feelings?  

";4;"Your feelings are justified: In *most relationships*, one afternoon per week together is *not sufficient* time to maintain a romantic bond. 

Relationships are commitments. It sometimes feels like a job because it is a sort of job. If you give no attention to your job, you get a poor performance review and eventually you're fired.

You're one small step from being a long distance relationship, which is a totally different arrangement than I'm sure you signed up for. Of course, people talk more often in LDRs than you guys do.

&gt; his lack of communication with me made me feel very distant from him. He argued that he felt as if he had messaged enough.

He's to the point where he's deliberately putting off conversations with you, and then tells you that he feels no need to communicate more.

In the grand scheme of things, all you need to consider is: Does this arrangement fulfill my relationship needs?

If the answer is ""no"", then you have to consider whether there's any hope of that situation changing. He's telling you it won't change.

";4;"I can’t imagine starting college in a serious relationship. I sort of agree with what the person said above re: relationships being like jobs, but you’re too young to think about it that way. A *marriage* is like a job; young love is not.  Not to sound too mom-ish, but your *only* job right now is doing well in school. Your preoccupation with him is obviously affecting your studies, in which case you really need to consider priorities.

My friend [26M] groped me [27F] after a drunken night out, and i'm not sure what to call it;t3_8d8p1j;6;"Last night, i went out with a group of friends to see a show. It was a pretty great night, until the end. I left with my friends Matt and Sarah around bar time. All three of us were pretty trashed, and we were ostensibly heading to find drunk food somewhere. We walked to Matt's house first, so he could let his dog out, and Sarah went inside to use the bathroom. I sat on the porch to wait, and suddenly, Matt swoops in, saying ""[my name], I've wanted to do this for a long time,"" grabs my face, and slams his mouth against mine.

I was stunned, and completely froze. I didn't want to kiss him -- I'm not interested in him romantically, and never got an inkling he was interested in me. But, due to the suddenness of the act, and my total shock, i didn't push him off of me like i wanted to. I think I was sort of taking the path of least resistance -- Sarah had just run in to pee, and would be back out any second.

So, he's kissing me (it's been like 5 seconds since he made the move) and grabs my left boob and squeezes, HARD. I yelped in pain, and at this point push him off of me, saying something along the lines of ""jesus, dude, wtf?"" I then brought up the fact that Sarah is into him (she is, and he knows), which was the first and only excuse I could think of in that moment that might get him to back off. He grumbled something, and then Sarah reappeared. I nixed our plans to find food, and Matt drove us both home (terrible move on all of our parts, considering how wasted he was.) About a half hour later, he texted, ""Hey!"" I didn't reply.

I'm not sure what to do, or how to feel. I definitely feel violated (he didn't even give me a chance to consent), but also feel like my lack of action diminishes how upset I'm ""allowed"" to be, which I know is dumb. It doesn't change that he shouldn't have fucking done that, but i'm just disappointed and a little ashamed that i didn't stand up for myself.

I'm also not sure if this rises to the level of sexual assault -- is it something slightly milder, like ""an unwanted advance,"" or simply ""shitty asshole behavior""? I'm not looking for a legal definition, but do want a way to classify it in more of a moral or emotional sense. I don't want to be hyperbolic and thus undermine survivors' stories, but it feels important to accurately name what happened so I can process my feelings about it.

I'm also not sure I should tell Sarah about it. I think she'd have my back, but this friendship is relatively new (we only really started hanging out 3 or 4 months ago), and we're going to be roommates next year. She'd believe me that it happened, I think, but it's really hard to hear that someone you trust and care about is kind of a scumbag. If she doesn't react well, living together for an entire year will probably be a bit of a bummer.

So, was I assaulted? Should I talk to Sarah? Should I talk to Matt? We're all in the same grad school program, and are part of a pretty tight-knit group of friends.

I'm usually a giant cranky feminist, and if one of my friends had told me this story, i'd have zero hesitation in calling it what it is. But for some reason, being the victim yourself warps your perspective and causes you to doubt your own experiences and perceptions. it's self-gaslighting, basically, which is so fucked. 

so yeah, it really, really helps to hear that my feelings are valid from people outside the situation (which was, i think, my main goal in making this post.) thanks for that, y'all. I'm going to talk to Sarah tomorrow, and Matt once I've had some time to process.

My friend [26M] groped me [27F] after a drunken night out, and i'm not sure what to call it;t3_8d8p1j;6;"Last night, i went out with a group of friends to see a show. It was a pretty great night, until the end. I left with my friends Matt and Sarah around bar time. All three of us were pretty trashed, and we were ostensibly heading to find drunk food somewhere. We walked to Matt's house first, so he could let his dog out, and Sarah went inside to use the bathroom. I sat on the porch to wait, and suddenly, Matt swoops in, saying ""[my name], I've wanted to do this for a long time,"" grabs my face, and slams his mouth against mine.

I was stunned, and completely froze. I didn't want to kiss him -- I'm not interested in him romantically, and never got an inkling he was interested in me. But, due to the suddenness of the act, and my total shock, i didn't push him off of me like i wanted to. I think I was sort of taking the path of least resistance -- Sarah had just run in to pee, and would be back out any second.

So, he's kissing me (it's been like 5 seconds since he made the move) and grabs my left boob and squeezes, HARD. I yelped in pain, and at this point push him off of me, saying something along the lines of ""jesus, dude, wtf?"" I then brought up the fact that Sarah is into him (she is, and he knows), which was the first and only excuse I could think of in that moment that might get him to back off. He grumbled something, and then Sarah reappeared. I nixed our plans to find food, and Matt drove us both home (terrible move on all of our parts, considering how wasted he was.) About a half hour later, he texted, ""Hey!"" I didn't reply.

I'm not sure what to do, or how to feel. I definitely feel violated (he didn't even give me a chance to consent), but also feel like my lack of action diminishes how upset I'm ""allowed"" to be, which I know is dumb. It doesn't change that he shouldn't have fucking done that, but i'm just disappointed and a little ashamed that i didn't stand up for myself.

I'm also not sure if this rises to the level of sexual assault -- is it something slightly milder, like ""an unwanted advance,"" or simply ""shitty asshole behavior""? I'm not looking for a legal definition, but do want a way to classify it in more of a moral or emotional sense. I don't want to be hyperbolic and thus undermine survivors' stories, but it feels important to accurately name what happened so I can process my feelings about it.

I'm also not sure I should tell Sarah about it. I think she'd have my back, but this friendship is relatively new (we only really started hanging out 3 or 4 months ago), and we're going to be roommates next year. She'd believe me that it happened, I think, but it's really hard to hear that someone you trust and care about is kind of a scumbag. If she doesn't react well, living together for an entire year will probably be a bit of a bummer.

So, was I assaulted? Should I talk to Sarah? Should I talk to Matt? We're all in the same grad school program, and are part of a pretty tight-knit group of friends.

I just don't fucking know, you know?

In practice? Eh, he's an asshole, he was drunk, and by 26 you should definitely know that sneaking up on a girl and surprising her by clamping your mouth onto her like a barnacle is not the way to go. I had that idea too when I was about 13, I think it came from movies. 

I guess the question is would you want to actually press charges on him? You could, it would be a he said she said situation that would probably destroy your ""tight"" little group. 

If not then call it whatever you want. I call it the guy being a drunk a-hole. Maybe talk to him when he's sober and let him know you're not having it. 

Lastly if you didn't want to kiss him, you definitely should have pushed him off right away. Taking ""the path of least resistance"" sends the wrong message to him and is a terrible move in our new, hyper-sexually sensitive culture.";0;0.0;[[0.96883163]];[[0.57078844]];-0.9697;0.096;0.769;0.135;-0.9041;0.078;0.7929999999999999;0.129;0.011999999999999995;-0.026473063973063968;-0.1135551948051948;0.08708213083213084

I've been with the same man for 7 years, and I crave no body else, but him. 

There are times when I happen to smell an amazing scented man and I get this fleeting moment of feeling turned on, but it passes fairly quickly and I take note to stay away from that person.

Last year I had to work away from my home for 4 months in a city my ex lives in. I had no idea she lived there. The last time we saw each other was about 4 and a half years ago. And we spoke about a year after that a couple times online over a week or so then never again.




I deleted my social media accounts and got a new phone number. My wife and I have been together for 3 and a half years. We dated for 2 and a half and got married last year. We knew each other through some friends for a few years before that. She didn't know much about my ex because we never spoke much about our exes. Not because either of us had anything to hide afaic but because it wasn't relevant to our relationship. She knew the ex's name and that we dated a couple years in college.




My ex befriended my wife online after she (my ex) ended up long distance dating a friend of my wife's. So they met a couple times when she came to visit her girlfriend. I didn't have a problem as we were in different paths in life now. My wife was incredibly upset with me for all of two - three weeks recently and I wound up getting super frustrated with her being distant and not saying anything about it. She made some super passive aggressive comment and I wound up asking her, ""what the f**k is your deal lately? I haven't done anything.""




Then I s**t you not, she starts crying and yelling at me telling me, ""I'm angry because you cheated and have the balls to lie to me everyday. You don't even seem like you're considering telling me."" These weren't her exact words but it's pretty close, I'm certain I went deaf for a moment when she said that to me.




She told me that my ex told her everything. Admittedly I was distant with my wife during our 4 months apart due to having tons and tons of work and being super stressed out at the time. My ex told her that she and I hooked up a lot over the 4 months I was there; that I came on to her and charmed her and preyed on her old feelings for me. Which was news to me. She said she felt terrible hooking up with a married man but that I used her emotions and promised her we'd could do this on the side every now and then. I asked my wife if my ex showed her any proof and she said that my ex deleted our messages out of guilt and she knows I wiped my messages.




I'm at a complete loss about what I should do. My wife is heartbroken and angry about an affair I never had and I'm devastated because my wife thinks I cheated on her. And she said she doesn't know if she wants to work through this. My ex is a liar, she wasn't a frequent liar when we were together and in our time as friends/friends with benefits in the years afterward. But she was a good one when she put her mind to it. I never bothered about it because they were usually tiny little things she didn't have to lie about until later. And when I did find out it was on purpose.




What should I do? My wife and I never had trust issues and at the time, she knew my distance was due to immense work stress. This is all new to me. My wife herself is an incredibly trusting person so I can see how someone might befriend her and slowly make her believe something like that. 




TL;DR Ex befriended and manipulated my wife into believing I had an affair, my wife is devastated and is thinking of splitting up";1;"&gt; What should I do?

Take action, don't just spew words to your wife.

1. Explain to your wife that you two have encountered a weapons-grade sociopath here, and that this is some pretty serious stuff.  

2. Say the wife can investigate whatever she wants, using whatever resources she wants.  Technology snoopers, message retrieval tools, etc.  You are an open book in terms of your phones, email accounts, message histories, whatever. She can hire whatever firm or slueth she wants to help. No holdback.

3. Schedule an appointment with an attorney and bring your wife. Explain to this lawyer what the woman did, and ask the lawyer if there is any legal remedy for what is going on here.  At least see if any sort of action for a PPO is available.  Make it clear to wife and lawyer that you are looking to (1) make this psycho gal feel some legal consequence for trying to cause such problems via lies, and (2) prevent any future instances of such bizarre conduct. If the lawyer thinks there is a legal basis for a claim and is willing to pursue it, file a lawsuit and swear out affidavits as necessary. When this gal gets served with court papers for tort claims or a PPO order, and then she has to go on record with her prior claims, she will disappear and run like hell, I expect.  Your wife will see that.

4. Tell wife she had better start thinking hard about how she decided to trust this gal without proof, rather than you. As there is no proof, and you are willing to provide access to all information, your wife has to decide who she is going to trust and believe, based on the available EVIDENCE, not just the say so of someone else.";11;11.0;[[0.95486586]];[[0.54611245]];-0.9837;0.087;0.789;0.124;0.3818;0.081;0.843;0.076;-0.04200000000000001;0.019271496477378837;0.10865384615384616;-0.08938234967646733

I never bothered about it because they were usually tiny little things she didn't have to lie about until later. And when I did find out it was on purpose.




What should I do? My wife and I never had trust issues and at the time, she knew my distance was due to immense work stress. This is all new to me. My wife herself is an incredibly trusting person so I can see how someone might befriend her and slowly make her believe something like that. 




TL;DR Ex befriended and manipulated my wife into believing I had an affair, my wife is devastated and is thinking of splitting up";1;"&gt; she doesn't know if she wants to work through this

Why do YOU want to work through this?  That's what I'm wondering.  You already had problems where you had to spend 4 months apart, and now she thinks you're lying without having any evidence to back that up.  That's insane.  I would say your wife is just as dangerous to you as your ex is.";-2;-2.0;[[0.94710964]];[[0.6011392]];-0.9837;0.087;0.789;0.124;-0.8909999999999999;0.018000000000000002;0.8170000000000001;0.165;0.11;0.019271496477378837;-0.35;0.3692714964773789

But if it bothers you . Sit down and talk about it . But don’t be confrontational about it . Tell her it sort of makes you feel uncomfortable or that maybe sending heart emojis should just be a special thing between you two .

The reason why she posts pictures on Instagram is so a bunch of male friends will tell her she’s hot. She’s doing this because she’s making sure if she dumps you, she has other options.

Tell her if she accuses you of being paranoid you’re dumping her. If she accuses you of being controlling then dump her. Tell her that trying to seek validation from other guys is nothing more than cheating. You’re the only validation she should want or desire.

Tl;dr girlfriend is Christian and I’m atheist.  She is constantly putting me down for my beliefs.  We love each other very much and I am looking for advice with how to take care of this issue. ";1;I was agnostic in the beginning and my wife is highly religious. She’s not so much church conformed but she’s strict on having faith. Our children want to hear bedtime prayers. I contently join in every night. But I’ve always had some kind of faith. God doesn’t promise a good outcome. Only man promises if you believe in the big book will you receive reward. But god never promised Jesus anything. He gave him his words and rewarded him in death but he lived a torturous life. The simplicity in that message is we simply should live by good words and form our path through life and in death we will be rewarded with whatever may be. Possibly reunited with our loved ones. Maybe if we desire a rebirth to start again until we feel a peace. One can never truly know. But if you hold your faith simply on what man has written in a story book throughout time based on their own views , hatred and beliefs then religion will never work for you. Because there’s only Ten Commandments. Not several chapters of life and judgement. The guild lines were simple. But the journey about how your practice them was never promised to be wonderful, perfect or even rewarding. That has to do with life hardships. Ones humans have created. But remind your girlfriend in the commandments it says not to judge thy neighbor. Simply don’t judge but the “house of god” doesn’t live by that rule they redirect it and live by the book they made to fit their benefit. Simply tell her she doesn’t truly follow god she follows mans word. If she truly wishes to follow god she needs to dig beyond what she knows. ;2;2.0;[[0.97418694]];[[0.61736219]];0.9358;0.14400000000000002;0.746;0.111;0.9954;0.249;0.655;0.096;-0.12;0.01811507936507936;0.2723636363636364;-0.2542485569985571

Is there anything I can do to make our relationship better or is it just a lost cause?  Should i just fake it?  Thanks for everyone’s input!

I sometimes attended church service on campus but had my doubts.  When we first started dating, she was not active in the church but considered herself Christian.

Belief isn’t a choice, it just is. If she’s blaming you for how you inherently are, that’s really not cool.

";1;Here's some perspective. I'm agnostic purely because we have no evidence of gods existence, much like we have no evidence to disprove his existence. Try to make her listen to reason. I get that you believe there is no god and maybe there isn't. I get she may believe there is one, but how do we really know? It would be a topic to discuss rather than get upset over. Sorry if im not helping, I just think you have a right to believe what you want just like she does, and it shouldn't matter about what happens after life, but it should matter about what happens in life.;2;2.0;[[0.9756155]];[[0.61061159]];0.9358;0.14400000000000002;0.746;0.111;-0.4946;0.07;0.8059999999999999;0.124;0.08699999999999998;0.01811507936507936;0.08;-0.06188492063492064
I [32M] Do Not Feel Appreciated By My [26F] GF, How Can I Get Her to Understand my POV?;t3_8d224y;4;"I had a fight with my g/f of almost 1.5 years today and I think this time it might be over. I don't think i've ever been this mad at anyone in my life but i blew up at her. I felt awful for yelling at her but at the same time she said some nasty things to me that just really hurt and set me off. She's going through a big change in her life right now so i try to give her a break,  but the last little while she's said some things to me that are unforgettable IMO. She's in the process of moving out from her parents so some of her issues are coming from the stresses of moving. 

As i mentioned above, she's moving and just today she got her lease agreement from the landlord. She sent it to me during the lunch hour but I was busy with work at the time, we conversed through FB messenger but i basically dropped what i was doing at work to have a look at the lease agreement for her and to give her my feedback. To give you an idea about her, she's the type that gets super antsy about things and we've had fights in the past where ""i didn't do something"" or "" I didn't get to something fast enough"". I didn't want to be the bottleneck of her signing the agreement and was genuinely excited for her so i didn't mind making this a priority. However, even after i got back to her in a decent time (before lunch ended) she didn't say a single thank you and just kind of took it as an entitlement that i'd look over all this for her. This made me feel slightly upset.

I tried not to think much of this and decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and dropped it. I met her after work to drive her home (i drive her home almost every day and i live on the other side of the city) and that's when she began shutting down on me. When she first got in the car, everything was OK, we kissed and even made some jokes about stuff but when we started talking about her move she seemed to get very quiet. 

I get the feeling that something was off so I test the waters and said something like ""you must be excited you're finally moving into your dream home!"". She didn't reply to this, just went completely silent and so a few seconds later i asked her if shes OK. She then just says nothing, i press her a little more and tell her i know when she's upset so i tell her to just tell me; and that's when she says ""I need a break from you this weekend"". In the past when we fight she generally says this so whatever. She also says that i was giving her attitude during lunch which i wasn't, i was busy with work stuff but i don't think i ever gave her any attitude when i looked back at the texts. Also, it's on text so i think it's hard to really gauge whether someone is giving you attitude? 

At this point, i don't know what i did wrong or what i did to piss her off, so i try to ask her more about what's going on and that she can talk to me about what's bugging her. She then just tells me to shut up and that i should know she's stressed from the move, especially being this is her first time. So this to me is weird as I've been helping her with all the moving stuff this entire time, I've done the following for her:

- helped her look for places
- arranged viewings for her and even drove her to the viewings
- looked at furniture and other household stuff together the last several weekends
- gave her my input/opinion on places and even gave her tips on what to do with utilities etc.

I tried re-assuring her that she wasn't alone in all of this and that i've been there for her this whole time with the move. It is at this moment where she says something like you've never helped me at all, all you've ever done is to tell me do this do that etc. She even went as far as calling me useless which is when i lost it on her. I can understand that someone is stressed, upset, but when you tell your significant other that you haven't helped a single bit and that you're useless it's crossing the line. It generally made me feel like crap and that i truly wasn't capable of helping her.

To be blunt i haven't felt appreciated from her for a good part of our relationship by now. I feel like i'm always the one doing the giving and running into things to help her or to make her day better. I often think if the roles were reversed would she do the same for me, and that answer is generally a no. She accuses me of being selfish but when in fact i've given almost everything i could to her be it advice, a listening shoulder, time away from my friends when she needs me, and even financially (i pay for 95% of our outings). 

I find she has no filter and it's easy for her to call me nasty names like asshole, or to say things like how she couldn't see being with me if she made more money than me and that she felt like i was a loser. The icing on the cake is from our last fight when she said she doesn't blame my ex for cheating on me and would've done similar. I don't know how someone can say all this nasty shit when all this time i've been a decent man to her. What the hell am i doing wrong guys or is she simply bat shit crazy? ";1;Bat shit crazy. Or, incredibly insecure and just takes it out on you. There’s no changing it now. She’s found that it’s acceptable to disrespect you, put you down, and take advantage of you. You could try distancing yourself from her, and let her know that you’ll spend more time when she respects you and your time, or just cut your losses and move on. It’s a good thing she didn’t move in with you from her parents house. ;2;2.0;[[0.95394055]];[[0.65873499]];-0.9866;0.10099999999999999;0.7709999999999999;0.128;-0.8553;0.1;0.7020000000000001;0.198;0.07100000000000001;-0.019630098898391582;-0.04259259259259263;0.022962493694201048

";1;In my opinion (24F) you are doing nothing wrong. Us women can be complicated at times, however, your GF sounds childish and unreasonable. If you’re supporting her (emotionally) the way you say, then she is just unappreciative of what you do. When someone’s actions seem “bat shit crazy”, believe what they’re showing you.  And bringing up shit that happened in a past relationship? Childish. Simply childish. It’s said that you don’t see someone for who they truly are until they go through hard times. If this is how she is now, what will it be like when shit really hits the fan? And people like that makes it hard for them to see your POV. They only see their own. Sorry it’s like this man! You should talk to her about everything you’ve said here and if she just brushes it off, she doesn’t respect you.

All transportation, social activities, and sharing expenses. He also had a young daughter at the time. I felt extremely guilty and worried about him, but you can't sacrifice your own well-being to take care of someone else. He ended up doing fine! He got some roommates. He found motivation to get out, make more friends, and do more things on his own. He worked harder to support himself. It brought out a whole new side of him, that was independent and self-fulfilling. (We actually ended up back together as a result.)

Please help!";82;"At 26 you are wasting the best years of your life on someone whose making them feel like less. Listen. Do not waste your time on someone less motivated than you. It’s not harder to leave someone like this. It’s easier. You know you have to. You know you want to. You know you should. 

Logistically speaking, if your lease is up soon (2-3 months) that makes this a little easier. Regardless, give him a month to find a new place to live. Do not help him. You are not helping him by making him reliant on you unless you plan to get back with this person or have him leaching on you forever. 

I would move in with family and friends while still going there every day to make sure he doesn’t do anything crazy. For a month. Don’t make it about seeing him tho. Make it about picking some things up, like mail. 

He may not be ready to move out when he has to but that’s not your problem and he will have to figure something out. Surprisingly to you, a friend will prob come out of the wood works and help him out. Regardless, it’s not your problem. Your problem is that you allowed this guy to use you (whether he knows it or not) and become dependent on you. Don’t make the same mistake again.

Think of it this way, people like him NEED people like you to force them into an undesirable situation so they can become self reliant and learn to sustain their own lifestyle. Tell him that you need someone who can support themselves and someone with drive and aspirations that wants to go somewhere in life. Explain that you need someone on the same life path as you and right now he just isn’t it.

Honestly it's toxic and it's the kind of relationship that has held me back from being social (i.e, he guilt trips me every time I want to spend time with friends and family) &amp; has prevented growth. I wish it was easy to just break up and call it a day, but my situation is complex. 

He relies on me for absolutely everything. We live together, but I'm the one who pays rent/bills. He doesn't have a car or a supportive family (came from a broken home--he rarely talks to his mom/sister). He's completely cut himself off from all of his friends. He gets spouts of depression from time to time. All he does is go to work, come home, smoke weed and play games. I want to move on from this relationship but I'm genuinely worried our breakup will put him in a bad position. If we breakup, I don't think he has anywhere to go. His family damn sure won't take him in, he doesn't have anymore friends and he definitely doesn't have enough money to get his own place. He doesn't even have a car to sleep in. The idea of him going homeless gives me so much anxiety, but I don't want to stay with him based on that alone. I deserve to be happy too, and right now I'm not.

Please help!";82;"I agree with others, set a date of 30 days and tell him you've thought long and hard about it and your decision is final. 

It really all depends on your living situation if there is a lease and how long is left on it. If only a little bit left then tell him you won't be re-signing and you're moving out. 

If this is your place then give him 30 days (or whatever the law is in your area) and put it in writing. Attempt to make him sign it. If he won't you take it to the county and have *them* sign it. 

But you don't want it to go like that. That is messy and it could feel like signing the relationship's death warrant and he could break all your stuff. Asking someone to move out is a hell of a lot trickier than just bouncing yourself. 

Have you begun the early steps of telling him you're not happy and that you've been considering a major change in your life / the relationship? That's the courtesy my girlfriend didn't afford me before I asked her to leave and it was all muddled.

Please help!";82;"You seem to have more money and more social support options. That, plus you being the one to drop the breakup conversation means that you should probably be the one to move out (temporarily). AirBnB is a good option if you don't have a supportive friend with enough space to host you for a few days/weeks - this isn't a 1 night sleepover.

You don't want to continue being in the same house after the breakup - it's super hard, sends mixed messages, and can prevent both or either of you from moving on effectively.

Make your arrangements quietly in advance, have the conversation, leave. 

If this is your home/apt with your name on the lease, put a timeframe on your absence. Then, either plan (openly) about how to break the lease and both find somewhere new, or - if you're the only one on the lease and want to stay - tell him he needs to have an alternate living arrangement, and his stuff out by or before May 1st (or whatever).";1;0.012195121951219513;[[0.94202154]];[[0.54481488]];-0.256;0.133;0.738;0.128;0.7285;0.078;0.856;0.066;-0.006999999999999992;0.10222863556196893;0.15549242424242424;-0.053263788680455317

Every single thing about your boyfriend and his situation is my boyfriend! 
It's so tiring and such a drag having to carry extra load of stress. I have to always motivate my boyfriend and constantly tell him to do things. 
I love him so much and he is so smart like really smart. I see so much potential in him that's why I keep pushing him.
My tip if you want to be with him still but want to see change. Just talk to him. Tell him what you want to see in the future. That's what I do. I always remind him from the background he came from and tell him that's not how I see myself or want to be. It really helps him get on track. 
If he gets mad at you for saying something. Don't feel sorry or show remorse. It's true. Tell him this can't be going on because it's dragging you down. Cry if you have to.

Please help!";82;"I used to be in the exact same position you are. I also had a relationship where my guy relied on me for EVERYTHING. Literally everything. Only difference is my guy didn’t even have a job. I found myself spending all my money on him, and he also made me feel guilty if I tried to go out with friends and family. I soon started to get depressed because I knew I did not want to be with him anymore, but felt like I could not leave him as he had nothing. How could I leave him when he didn’t even have a job? Well, I did. And let me tell you...it was the best decision I have ever made. I only wish I hadn’t waited so long to break up with him. And guess what, he survived. I was so afraid that he would be homeless and starving, but he figured out what to do once I cut all ties with him. The amount of weight that was lifted off my shoulders when I finally broke up with him was immense. And now I am in an extremely happy relationship where we BOTH contribute money/other things.

I'll keep it short &amp; sweet. I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years. In the past year or so, I've found myself extremely unhappy in this relationship. Honestly it's toxic and it's the kind of relationship that has held me back from being social (i.e, he guilt trips me every time I want to spend time with friends and family) &amp; has prevented growth. I wish it was easy to just break up and call it a day, but my situation is complex. 

He relies on me for absolutely everything. We live together, but I'm the one who pays rent/bills. He doesn't have a car or a supportive family (came from a broken home--he rarely talks to his mom/sister). He's completely cut himself off from all of his friends. He gets spouts of depression from time to time. All he does is go to work, come home, smoke weed and play games. I want to move on from this relationship but I'm genuinely worried our breakup will put him in a bad position. If we breakup, I don't think he has anywhere to go. His family damn sure won't take him in, he doesn't have anymore friends and he definitely doesn't have enough money to get his own place. He doesn't even have a car to sleep in.

I [24 F] crushing on 28 yo M, unsure how he feels. Advice would be very much appreciated!!;t3_8cpj8i;2;"Hi everyone! I am an 24 year old female who is crushing hard on a 28 year old male.

To sum up our situation: we are in graduate school together, were friends but started hanging out and hooking up a month ago. Since then we have been hanging out quite often. This past week we have hung out everyday and every time we hang out it is magical. We bike and explore the city for hours, try out really yummy and cool restaurants, go to beach, go on hikes, and other fun, adventurous things. We are playful and silly when we are together yet at the same time we can get lost in talking about life, the universe and other deep meaningful topics.

When were together it's like I'm a young child again and he brings out all the sides of me that I love about myself and makes me want to be a better person. He has told me a few times that I have positively influenced his life since meeting me and enjoys hanging out with me.

I have never met someone like him and I am falling pretty fast. My only worry is that I am unsure if the feeling is mutual. The main reason I feel this way is that one of the first times we hung out we were talking about our fears in life and I remember him saying he doesn't want to lead anyone on and that him and his ex broke up a year or so ago because he wasn't ready to be super serious. I don't know if this is how he still feels but I truly believe you only feel that you're not ready for a relationship when that person isn't 100% right for you, whether you consciously notice it or not.

I fall in love with people easily after I see all their amazing traits and I am easily excited and fascinated. He does sweet things for me, we go on dates and what not, but I don't know if he sees this as something casual or if he would want to start dating.

So my questions to you are:

What are your thoughts about this situation?

How would a guy show someone that they like them more than just a hookup/friends with benefits?

How soon is too soon to talk about what we are?


";1;"&gt; How would a guy show someone that they like them more than just a hookup/friends with benefits?

This is a conversation that should have taken place much earlier. You should've known before you started hooking up whether he wanted a FWB situation or a potential romantic partner. They're sort of divergent paths; couples almost never cross over from one to the other.

You can't really judge intent the way you can judge attractiveness via body language and other signs. The line between FWB and romantic partners is more of a sliding scale; some couples do a lot of flirting, while others are more-or-less ""strictly business"". 

So... sorry, but you guys need to have a long-overdue talk about feelings and intent.

We are in a long distance relationship for 2.5 years.  We dated for 1.5 years in the same city before that.  The past 2 years have not been great, as we seem to have grown apart to some degree.  I moved away for work and that started it.  She was resentful of that, and started being somewhat mean.  That led me to think about breaking up (and trying to a couple of times, without it sticking), and also flirting with other girls and looking at dating apps (not actually going on dates, just looking).  She knows this, from her looking at my phone and reading emails, and me coming clean.  I'm not proud of that, but must include for full disclosure as it partly explains why I am not sure what to do.

The first year and a half that we were together was great.  She is very social, loves to travel, gets along with everyone, and is a real ""life of the party"" type.  I tend to be more introverted, so it was a fun change (even her friends are way more party-centric than mine).  It really started to go downhill with the move, and with her seeing my ""cheating"" (as she calls it).  

Since then, I haven't been able to get things on track.  I feel like I've really tried (planning nice dates and trips, flowers, etc).  I thought that getting engaged would make things better, because she would know I'm committed and would remove that anxiety or uncertainty.  It hasn't.

She has called me stupid (and cursing variations of that) on a number of occasions, and a couple of times even hit me. I think she has anger management problems.  I also sometimes get the sense that she doesn't even like me, and is just ""settling"" for this because she things she is too old to start over and wants to have kids. 

We also are not aligned on where to live and finances.  She hates my current city and will very likely not like living here (though has agreed to move after the wedding), as its too small and not many jobs in her field.  She also comes from a wealthy family and has a lot of friends who are in finance or dating finance guys, so she thinks I am cheap/poor/unsuccessful (though I do fine).

So, why do you want to get married? There are large number of incompatibilities, a massive lack of respect, scant affection and domestic violence. 

So call her up or visit and break things off. use this as a list. Just do be firm quick and gentle.

Why go to the bother &amp; expense of a wedding then divorce? You both can do better.

That led me to think about breaking up (and trying to a couple of times, without it sticking), and also flirting with other girls and looking at dating apps (not actually going on dates, just looking).  She knows this, from her looking at my phone and reading emails, and me coming clean.  I'm not proud of that, but must include for full disclosure as it partly explains why I am not sure what to do.

The first year and a half that we were together was great.  She is very social, loves to travel, gets along with everyone, and is a real ""life of the party"" type.  I tend to be more introverted, so it was a fun change (even her friends are way more party-centric than mine).  It really started to go downhill with the move, and with her seeing my ""cheating"" (as she calls it).  

Since then, I haven't been able to get things on track.  I feel like I've really tried (planning nice dates and trips, flowers, etc).  I thought that getting engaged would make things better, because she would know I'm committed and would remove that anxiety or uncertainty.  It hasn't.  She gets mad at me or is crying at some point every time we visit, in a way that leads to sulking and being unhappy the rest of the day.  She has called me stupid (and cursing variations of that) on a number of occasions, and a couple of times even hit me. I think she has anger management problems.  I also sometimes get the sense that she doesn't even like me, and is just ""settling"" for this because she things she is too old to start over and wants to have kids. 

We also are not aligned on where to live and finances.  She hates my current city and will very likely not like living here (though has agreed to move after the wedding), as its too small and not many jobs in her field.  She also comes from a wealthy family and has a lot of friends who are in finance or dating finance guys, so she thinks I am cheap/poor/unsuccessful (though I do fine).

Long story short- I dont know what to do.

I feel like if I go through with the wedding, I'd be ignoring very obvious warning signs that its not going to work out.  People seem to say problems get worse after you are married, and that no one regrets calling it off.
She essentially said on one occasion that she would break up if she was 28 (though that could be written off as anger)...just something that stuck with me.

On the other hand:
-I recognize that I caused the downturn in our relationship.  I moved away, and I was unfaithful.  
-I feel that breaking up at this point would be incredibly mean and cruel.  She's been through an unhappy two years and toughed it out, and she's been planning a really nice destination wedding in Europe (venue booked, lots of details made, website, up, etc). Wedding is in early October
-The things i loved about her early on are still there- she is fun, smart, pretty and I enjoy spending time with her (when she is in a good mood).  It's just that she hasn't been in a good mood lately, and often seems like she doesn't like me (gets mad about the fact that i bit my nails, and eat too fast, and squint in photos....like, literally gets mad about those things)
-I'm also scared to break up myself.  On account of the long distance relationship, i haven't developed much of a social life in the new city.  And I'm older than the ""singles"" crowd.  I might not find someone as good again (objectively speaking).

Basically, since I caused the problems in the first place and I do love her, I feel like i cant get off the marriage train.

marriage is not a fixer solution, that was a mistake on your part. you shouldn't use marriage to prove yourself in a relationship, because it never works out well in those cases. if anything, it will probably create more stress because now she ""has"" to move to your city and uproot her entire life, when it sounds like she is unhappy with this relationship too (from what you have told us)

also, you may have not physically done anything on the dating apps, but in her shoes, that hurts like hell. finding out your SO decided to sign up on dating apps, then having them propose to you to prove that the commitment is real? it sounds like both of you are settling, just because you sunk enough time into this relationship. that's not a good basis for married life";4;2.0;[[0.97279155]];[[0.69353759]];0.9953;0.158;0.745;0.09699999999999999;-0.8313;0.076;0.8109999999999999;0.113;0.098;0.06246266233766235;0.14545454545454548;-0.08299188311688313

There are specific things you should be doing to earn back her trust; it’s tough to be able to understand what being betrayed by a partner does to a person. It is immensely (I speak from experience unfortunately) painful and often the betrayed spouse cannot reconcile their previous view of you with this person that treated them as dispensable and effectively had the capacity to be selfish to the point of forsaking the person they betrayed. That’s serious business and planning outings or shows of commitment fall incredibly short of showing that you can be trusted (you committed to her before, and had no issues breaking said commitment by being unfaithful—why would greater commitment prove to her that you wouldn’t betray her again?).

The upshot is this: It’s not acceptable for her to be abusive towards you, but she can be really angry with you and can have extreme difficulty being warm and open with you for years (expect 2-5 years before most healing had occurred). Now...to actually give this relationship a real chance, you must attempt reconciliation. That is basically your burden as the unfaithful partner; reconciliation takes *years* of some really serious and *consistent* hard work towards showing her it’s okay/safe to love and trust you (you burned her the first time so this isn’t guaranteed to work even if you do everything perfectly). You can’t expect a relationship to survive infidelity (and your looking through dating apps is definitely considered cheating) without sustained and appropriate (recommended by counselors etc) work on your part. 

If you don’t believe you can make this sort of effort, it’s in both your best interests to end the relationship now. This is the mature and adult thing to do; even if you are the one to suggest it (and it will definitely be additional pain for her if you do), it’s still the ethical thing to do in the long run.

Would this comment about poisoning a spouse bother you?;t3_8cy591;4;"my partner is the paranoid type and he makes comments that are often strange or off color.

However, this morning I became upset over something that seemed far worse than normal.  He doesn’t like a woman that I work with at all.  Her husband is dying.  I mentioned that it’s her second husband and her first died of cancer.   He said WOW so 2 husbands dying?   They should check to see if she is poisoning them.

I said NO!  They are in their 60s… come on.  Cancer and disease happens.

He said he doesn’t trust her or like her — 

He said ‘boy that must be nice.  get the life insurance and your husband “mysteriously” dies.”

I said look — that’s a scary comment. 

He said that I am scary and that I like to try to flip things.  I said NO but I would never say that.

He said you are right because “people who do these things NEVER talk about them.”

I said that is ridiculous.  He said that “I” am ridiculous because I am questioning him or turning his statement into something it’s not.
";1;"Really? I don’t think his comment is strange. He doesn’t like this woman, doesn’t trust her. Found out that not one but now two of her husbands are dead/dying.   

Seems like a reasonable conclusion to draw. Everyone has heard of the “black widow” women. Not saying that she is killing people but it’s crazy bad luck for two husbands to die on you. If I heard this, it would at least cross my mind.

If he didnt explicitly state that reddit was something private that he’d prefer to keep from you, then there’s nothing wrong with looking up your boyfriend’s profile! It’s kinda rude of him to be leaving those comments if you guys are in a relationship so confront him!! Tell him you aren’t comfortable with him leaving those comments. If he refuses to stop, denies it, or says you’re being clingy, then he isn’t worth your time! 

Even if you feel sneaky, he could be hiding that from you, which is hella sneaky. 

You are worth more than that, and it is ok to prioritize your own feelings sometimes.

Everything else in your post is irrelevant. Your boyfriend's behavior is irrelevant.

You believed you were unworthy and believed you were liable to be abandoned *long before* you met your current B/F.  I'm guessing at least since  age 6 or so.

Don't try to pin that on your BF, he jut reminded you of those narratives.

Fix your negative beliefs and narratives about yourself, or else this will be a recurring issue.

I don't know what to do. Should I tell him or not? ";4;"I do not think that he has done anything wrong by commenting on other women’s body as there are many men who do it but that does not mean that they are comparing them with their partners. 

If he loves you then I think you have nothing to worry but since it is bothering you I would say talk to him about it and hear what he has to say. If he loves you then I am sure he will make you reassure that you have nothing to worry and he loves you, there are full chances that he did it without thinking too much. First discuss with him what you have found out and then decide the next course of action.  

There is no need to assume the worst over him commenting on other women but it is your right to ask for the explanation.

I don't know what to do. Should I tell him or not? ";4;"Pretty much every man with access to porn looks at porn. Pretty much every human being has sexual thoughts about people who are not their primary partner. So, now you have evidence that your online boyfriend is like pretty much everyone else. I'm not sure how you think this conversation will go. You snooped for no particular reason and found something you didn't want to know. Now you want to burden him with that knowledge? And he's supposed to comfort you? Good luck with that. 

If your relationship problem is that you wish to control your partner's thoughts, then perhaps you are not emotionally ready for a relationship. I get that typing a comment is slightly different than simply thinking it, but most people comment on Reddit with the assumption that their words are being submitted anonymously, and that they can share their thoughts without any connection to their non-Reddit life. 

If your relationship has been conducted 100% online, has it occurred to you that you might try to have a real relationship with a person you can go out with? That could go a long way toward helping you with your feelings of insecurity.

I thought he would stop, but now he has asked me to his formal (dance). I didn’t even know how to respond. He may be thinking of this in a platonic way, but all of the other times he has asked me out obviously weren’t.

Uhm....maybe because you haven’t actually explicitly stated “I’m not interested.” You’ve simply avoided saying an outright no. 

Now, most everyone with some resemblance of common sense would get that you’re not interested but sometimes people are so invested that they convince themselves that you really do have “other plans” and it’s not that you’re just not interested. 

Be explicit. Tell him, “I’m not interested.” Otherwise, this guy is going to keep trying. ";9;9.0;[[0.95611923]];[[0.6987584]];0.9664;0.152;0.763;0.085;-0.6053;0.027000000000000003;0.87;0.10300000000000001;0.14300000000000002;0.015000000000000003;-0.031818181818181815;0.04681818181818181

How long should i [27M] keep my relationship going with my S/O [27F] of two+ years when, we match up with everything except our thoughts on kids/children?;t3_8czuou;3;"See the title. For quick context, she wants 1 or 2 kids in the future and I'm extremely hesitant to almost not interested in having kids.

This is something that's weighing a bit heavy on my mind lately. 

To start, this is not something we've never talked about, we had been friends for many years before we started dating and when we did start going out we established very a strong process of communication early on and things are really good in that department. 

We can always talk and early on we had serious talks about what we wanted, our futures, marriage, kids etc. and we pretty much align on all things but there is a pretty clear dissonance when it comes to kids.

We have our reasons but as I said at the start, she wants kids, and I range from hesitant to generally uninterested in kids. We talked about this and have continued to occasionally bring it up because we don't think it's an issue to ignore. 

The romance and love and dedication is all there in our relationship but I don't think she is ever going to, nor would I want to, change her mind about kids.

My issue is more that my hesitation means that I don't know if I will want to have kids in the future I just don't, it may make more sense for me to have kids when I'm at a different point in life and she's the kind of person I would want to have kids with if I ever reached that point but as of now I just don't know if that's ever a point and I've told her this/she knows. Not only that but I come from a single parent home so I'm a firm believer in not having kids unless you are sure you are committed to the challenge.

I've never tried to sway her mind. Her desires and dreams get the most respect from me but as you can see, this is a pretty serious issue and lately it's been on my mind more because I don't feel like my stance has changed since we've been going out. I've been having some restless dreams about it and now we've been going out for almost 3 years. This is longest I've dated anyone. I have very strong feelings for her and I know she has the same for me but I don't know if it's right to keep her ""waiting for me to change my mind"" about having kids.

I know it's unclear because I feel the same way, but if you really ask yourself you can get an idea, maybe it's just the fact that you can't bear the responsibility of raising kids?

How long should i [27M] keep my relationship going with my S/O [27F] of two+ years when, we match up with everything except our thoughts on kids/children?;t3_8czuou;3;"See the title. For quick context, she wants 1 or 2 kids in the future and I'm extremely hesitant to almost not interested in having kids.

This is something that's weighing a bit heavy on my mind lately. 

To start, this is not something we've never talked about, we had been friends for many years before we started dating and when we did start going out we established very a strong process of communication early on and things are really good in that department. 

We can always talk and early on we had serious talks about what we wanted, our futures, marriage, kids etc. and we pretty much align on all things but there is a pretty clear dissonance when it comes to kids.

We have our reasons but as I said at the start, she wants kids, and I range from hesitant to generally uninterested in kids. We talked about this and have continued to occasionally bring it up because we don't think it's an issue to ignore. 

The romance and love and dedication is all there in our relationship but I don't think she is ever going to, nor would I want to, change her mind about kids.

My issue is more that my hesitation means that I don't know if I will want to have kids in the future I just don't, it may make more sense for me to have kids when I'm at a different point in life and she's the kind of person I would want to have kids with if I ever reached that point but as of now I just don't know if that's ever a point and I've told her this/she knows. Not only that but I come from a single parent home so I'm a firm believer in not having kids unless you are sure you are committed to the challenge.

I've never tried to sway her mind. Her desires and dreams get the most respect from me but as you can see, this is a pretty serious issue and lately it's been on my mind more because I don't feel like my stance has changed since we've been going out. I've been having some restless dreams about it and now we've been going out for almost 3 years. This is longest I've dated anyone. I have very strong feelings for her and I know she has the same for me but I don't know if it's right to keep her ""waiting for me to change my mind"" about having kids. 

What's the right thing to do at this point r/relationship advice?

Before anyone chimes in with ""talk to her"" yes I know, I'm just sorting my thoughts out first, hence why I'm here. 

Thank you for any responses I get";1;"If you don't want kids and she does then this is pretty open/shut. You clearly have to end things, and stop delaying it. Do it today so she can get over you and have time to find someone else on the same page as her.     

Seriously, this is something that should have happened the moment you learned she really wanted kids and you knew you didn't.       

Get up right now and do it. ";1;1.0;[[0.96228336]];[[0.55198772]];0.9922;0.127;0.823;0.05;0.4172;0.075;0.861;0.065;0.067;0.16983333333333334;0.08373015873015872;0.08610317460317461

";1;"You can't make him feel anything - he has to do his own emotional work. You shouldn't aim your sex life at fixing his emotional issues either, those are apples and oranges and you are NOT his therapist.'

The fact that sex *was* great but isn't when you're living together is pretty telling. Are you the one doing the household tasks and reminding him to put his dishes in the sink? Are you mothering him? STOP THAT SHIT if you are, moving in together often causes sexual issues because both people fall into roleplaying - the guy becomes helpless and adolescent, the girl starts trying to keep things together by taking on the mother role. Sure, it's a comfortable dynamic, because its embedded into the culture, but inevitably sex becomes problematic for both of them.

This might be a lifestyle problem, and if you reframe the way your daily activities define your household identity, it could help.";1;1.0;[[0.96437323]];[[0.58891889]];0.9841;0.147;0.8079999999999999;0.045;-0.2165;0.13;0.755;0.115;0.087;0.17152777777777775;0.2375;-0.06597222222222228

I think he wants me to just ""take a hint"" and leave him alone but I think this method of breaking up is really immature because I don't know what I've done wrong (if I've done anything wrong at all). 

I really want to talk to him about our situation (to get some closure, mostly) but I only see him in public and it's hard to talk to him in a private place. He doesn't pick up his phone and he doesn't text back whenever I try reaching out to him. 

I'm not a very good conversationalist, even with him, and I think this is the main reason why he's been acting aloof. He probably thinks I'm uninterested, but that isn't the case at all. 

Starting conversations has never been my strong suit.

I am also guilty of ignoring him at times, but that's only because he's ignoring me and I'm not sure how to break the cycle.

Considering how young we are, I know that this isn't very serious. However, he's my first boyfriend and I want to end things on good terms. We're both shy people, so I understand why he'd be scared to talk things out, but I think talking about it will be the best way to solve this problem.

I [25M] have been with amazing girlfriend [25F] for over a year now. We get along great. She is my best friend. But I am not as attracted as I would like to be, and don't know what to do.;t3_8cqiqd;25;"Hi, 

I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now. We met online via a website where users can share works of writing and art with one another. It was through these online interactions that we were brought together. I was impressed by her amazing ability to write and her mine, leading to us eventually meet up. 

I wasn’t initially attracted to her. But, in regards to the person I wanted to be with, she checked off so many of the boxes, I felt it would be a terrible loss to just write her off because of my level attraction to her. As I said, we’ve been together for over a year now. We have great chemistry, she is extremely patient and understanding of me, very loyal and open-minded, and also, she is smart. Very smart. Her wit and intelligence is easily one my top 5 favorite trait of her’s – the other’s being the ones I previously named. 

With all the said, those initial attraction issues I had at the beginning haven’t completely faded away like I’d hoped. Even after a year. And This terrifies me. We spend a lot of time together. She is my best friend. I do feel someone like her is a rarity in my life. I can sometimes be very temperamental, anxious, and depressed and she gracefully puts up with all these varying sides of me. She has a degree in psychology and has also struggled with a great deal herself. Because of this, I feel she is equipped to provide support for me more so than many others would. I feel she puts up with more than many would because she can empathize and genuinely does care.

With all that said, I feel incredibly guilty. She’s nearly perfect for me, and extremely important to me. And yet, I can’t seem to fully appreciate the package she came in and that makes me feel, just, terrible. I look at other girls, and wonder what it’d be like to be with someone else. Not because I necessarily want to be with someone else, but because I want to know for sure that she is (or isn’t) the right one. I am not sure if that line of thinking even makes sense. 

I’ve read up a lot about people who have been in similar situations. The general consensus seems to be that I need to just break up with her. Break up because it’s not fair to her nor me. Because she deserves someone who will see her completely for how amazing she is, and I deserve to be without this constant nagging notion/weight on my shoulders. But, how do you break up with your best friend? Leaving someone that checks 9 out of the 10 boxes (the 10th being my level of attraction), feels like a mistake. It doesn’t feel like its that simple. It just doesn’t feel like the right thing to do – and yet, at the same time, it feels like it is the only option in this situation that I have. I hate this. Hate the fact that I’m here, writing this. If she knew I were feeling this way, she wouldn’t want to be with me anymore. Why would she? This is a weight on me, and I honestly just want a “fix”.

Is there any advice anyone can offer? She is an amazing partner and person. We get along great. She makes me laugh (a rarity among females), she makes me smile, I trust her completely – all of these traits, I know are rare these days, and yet, I am letting my sense of attraction to her override all of that. And it is a weight on me. I know level of attraction is important. But, - this - important?

";61;"There is a story in the film ""Paris, Je T'aime"" in which a man has fallen out of love with his wife and he is about to leave her when she tells him she is dying. Learning this he decides to stay with her and works to make her final days special and memorable, he spends all of his time with her doing all of their favorite things together and in the end he comes to a realization, he admits: ""By acting like a man in love again, I became a man in love again."" I bring this up because I think you might benefit from a change of perspective. I assume it is her physical attractiveness that you struggle with? What if you worked on trying to broaden your perspective of what is attractive? What if you made a conscious effort to see her individual beauty? If she checks off 9 out of your 10 boxes, it might be worth putting in a little more effort in altering your thoughts. Every time the thought that your not attracted to her enters your mind, try thinking instead about a physical trait of hers that you find beautiful. Maybe by thinking like a man that is attracted to her, you will become a man who is attracted to her.";120;1.9672131147540983;[[0.98278858]];[[0.6896513]];0.9985;0.20199999999999999;0.745;0.053;0.9865;0.185;0.76;0.054000000000000006;0.018000000000000016;0.21878078817733995;0.30703781512605044;-0.08825702694871049

Because she deserves someone who will see her completely for how amazing she is, and I deserve to be without this constant nagging notion/weight on my shoulders. But, how do you break up with your best friend? Leaving someone that checks 9 out of the 10 boxes (the 10th being my level of attraction), feels like a mistake. It doesn’t feel like its that simple. It just doesn’t feel like the right thing to do – and yet, at the same time, it feels like it is the only option in this situation that I have. I hate this. Hate the fact that I’m here, writing this. If she knew I were feeling this way, she wouldn’t want to be with me anymore. Why would she? This is a weight on me, and I honestly just want a “fix”.

Is there any advice anyone can offer? She is an amazing partner and person. We get along great. She makes me laugh (a rarity among females), she makes me smile, I trust her completely – all of these traits, I know are rare these days, and yet, I am letting my sense of attraction to her override all of that. And it is a weight on me. I know level of attraction is important. But, - this - important?

";61;"I've been on a few dates with a guy, and have the same lingering feeling as you do about your girlfriend.  All of the positive qualities you used to describe her and why she is so important to you are important aspects of a relationship.  However, one important factor you did not mention is the romance.


Is there an intimate connection between the two of you?  Not looking for anything graphic, but to put it bluntly: How's your sex life?  


If it's lackluster, that's not good.  On the other hand, if your waning attraction for her does not interfere with your sex life, then you might be okay.";29;0.47540983606557374;[[0.9745078]];[[0.50239349]];0.9985;0.20199999999999999;0.745;0.053;0.9413;0.183;0.792;0.026000000000000002;-0.00799999999999998;0.21878078817733995;0.13202479338842973;0.08675599478891023
I [25M] have been with amazing girlfriend [25F] for over a year now. We get along great. She is my best friend. But I am not as attracted as I would like to be, and don't know what to do.;t3_8cqiqd;25;"Hi, 

I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now. We met online via a website where users can share works of writing and art with one another. It was through these online interactions that we were brought together. I was impressed by her amazing ability to write and her mine, leading to us eventually meet up. 

I wasn’t initially attracted to her. But, in regards to the person I wanted to be with, she checked off so many of the boxes, I felt it would be a terrible loss to just write her off because of my level attraction to her. As I said, we’ve been together for over a year now. We have great chemistry, she is extremely patient and understanding of me, very loyal and open-minded, and also, she is smart. Very smart. Her wit and intelligence is easily one my top 5 favorite trait of her’s – the other’s being the ones I previously named. 

With all the said, those initial attraction issues I had at the beginning haven’t completely faded away like I’d hoped. Even after a year. And This terrifies me. We spend a lot of time together. She is my best friend. I do feel someone like her is a rarity in my life. I can sometimes be very temperamental, anxious, and depressed and she gracefully puts up with all these varying sides of me. She has a degree in psychology and has also struggled with a great deal herself. Because of this, I feel she is equipped to provide support for me more so than many others would. I feel she puts up with more than many would because she can empathize and genuinely does care.

With all that said, I feel incredibly guilty. She’s nearly perfect for me, and extremely important to me. And yet, I can’t seem to fully appreciate the package she came in and that makes me feel, just, terrible. I look at other girls, and wonder what it’d be like to be with someone else.

";61;"If you’re really looking for an answer: End the relationship. 

You’ve shared this romantic relationship for over a year and you are still not fulfilled. Usually, spending that amount of blissful, intimate (and I don’t mean just sexually) time together deepens and strengthens a relationship and fortifies the commitment.

It seems that after all that time together, the “one box” that isn’t checked off still has more importance and weight than all the other “9 boxes” combined do. There’s nothing truly wrong with that as you have every right to decide what is important to you - it just means that you’re not going to be happy leaving that 10th box halfway unchecked in the long run with this specific woman. Honestly, your attraction to her won’t magically grow after another year or two together, and you will essentially waste both of your time forging a relationship that is so precariously weighted in favor of an area she can’t personally fulfill for you.

It sucks. I know you probably genuinely care for her. But if she means that much to you, you have to do the right thing and let her go. If she ever finds out that you don’t find her that attractive and that you also daydream about what it’s like to be with the more attractive strangers you see elsewhere, it will absolutely crush her and destroy her self-esteem.

";61;"This is a very difficult situation to be stuck in. You are being neither superficial nor vain nor cruel; physical attraction is a very real biological response the body has. It is affected by society and social norms? Of course it is. I am of the opinion, however, that at some level we cannot control who we are attracted to, or what “type” we are etc. This is not something to feel bad about; it simply is reality. This is why it annoys me when, for example, someone introduces me to a guy who has a great personality, etc etc, but if don’t find him attractive for whatever reason, I’m somehow being judgmental/superficial. Sometimes you either are attracted or you’re not, and it’s that simple. 

Can you grow to be attracted to someone based on their personality, intelligence, talent etc? Of course. But this is not always the case.

";61;"I’m gonna suggest romanticism. Think about what you love about her as a person, then look at her and think about how that person is like a vessel for what you love. She may not be a supermodel (hypothetically, I don’t know your girlfriend and I’m sure she’s lovely no matter what), but she is kind, and smart, and funny, etc, and that makes everything about her more beautiful. 

I’m by no means a 10, but my boyfriend loves me because I am more than my physical appearance, we share a spiritual and emotional and personal bond that wouldn’t be replicated with another person, and wouldn’t even be replicated by an identical twin or clone if I had one. I feel the same for him.

Consider this situation: you have an option to be with someone that encompasses all your physical ideals of beauty, but her personality is awful and not at all something that makes you happy. Your girlfriend, although maybe not Aphrodite made mortal, is beautiful because you have a bond with her that can’t be replicated by anyone else.

At that point, would you rather still be with this person, or some other 55 year old woman who was once more attractive decades before?";4;0.06557377049180328;[[0.95603667]];[[0.58150281]];0.9985;0.20199999999999999;0.745;0.053;0.5413;0.06;0.94;0.0;0.08900000000000002;0.21878078817733995;0.3125;-0.09371921182266003
I [25M] have been with amazing girlfriend [25F] for over a year now. We get along great. She is my best friend. But I am not as attracted as I would like to be, and don't know what to do.;t3_8cqiqd;25;"Hi, 

I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now. We met online via a website where users can share works of writing and art with one another. It was through these online interactions that we were brought together. I was impressed by her amazing ability to write and her mine, leading to us eventually meet up. 

I wasn’t initially attracted to her. But, in regards to the person I wanted to be with, she checked off so many of the boxes, I felt it would be a terrible loss to just write her off because of my level attraction to her. As I said, we’ve been together for over a year now. We have great chemistry, she is extremely patient and understanding of me, very loyal and open-minded, and also, she is smart. Very smart. Her wit and intelligence is easily one my top 5 favorite trait of her’s – the other’s being the ones I previously named. 

With all the said, those initial attraction issues I had at the beginning haven’t completely faded away like I’d hoped. Even after a year. And This terrifies me. We spend a lot of time together. She is my best friend. I do feel someone like her is a rarity in my life. I can sometimes be very temperamental, anxious, and depressed and she gracefully puts up with all these varying sides of me. She has a degree in psychology and has also struggled with a great deal herself. Because of this, I feel she is equipped to provide support for me more so than many others would. I feel she puts up with more than many would because she can empathize and genuinely does care.

With all that said, I feel incredibly guilty. She’s nearly perfect for me, and extremely important to me. And yet, I can’t seem to fully appreciate the package she came in and that makes me feel, just, terrible. I look at other girls, and wonder what it’d be like to be with someone else. Not because I necessarily want to be with someone else, but because I want to know for sure that she is (or isn’t) the right one. I am not sure if that line of thinking even makes sense. 

I’ve read up a lot about people who have been in similar situations. The general consensus seems to be that I need to just break up with her. Break up because it’s not fair to her nor me. Because she deserves someone who will see her completely for how amazing she is, and I deserve to be without this constant nagging notion/weight on my shoulders. But, how do you break up with your best friend? Leaving someone that checks 9 out of the 10 boxes (the 10th being my level of attraction), feels like a mistake. It doesn’t feel like its that simple. It just doesn’t feel like the right thing to do – and yet, at the same time, it feels like it is the only option in this situation that I have. I hate this. Hate the fact that I’m here, writing this. If she knew I were feeling this way, she wouldn’t want to be with me anymore. Why would she? This is a weight on me, and I honestly just want a “fix”.

Is there any advice anyone can offer? She is an amazing partner and person. We get along great. She makes me laugh (a rarity among females), she makes me smile, I trust her completely – all of these traits, I know are rare these days, and yet, I am letting my sense of attraction to her override all of that. And it is a weight on me. I know level of attraction is important. But, - this - important?

Help?
";61;"You will never fill all 10 boxes. You just have to decide how much weight each box has.

I tried to be in a relationship with a man I wasn't attracted to. I eventually developed vaginimis (look it up, it sucks...) because I was so turned off by sex with him that my vagina literally got tense so often that it basically broke :(

Sorry for the way too much tmi. But my point is that sexual attraction is apparently a necessity for me. I NEED that box checked off, and you know what, that's ok. I'm not being conceited or shallow. I also don't need some sort of male model. What I'm talking about is physical chemistry and appreciating this person in a sexual way. Also recognize that sexual attraction and excitement does lessen over time but in my opinion it had better at least be there in the honeymoon phase. 

This is important enough to you that your on here asking strangers because it still bothers you. It's ok to want to be with a person your sexually attracted to, after all if your not how is it different than a platonic friendship?";4;0.06557377049180328;[[0.98378622]];[[0.64838153]];0.9985;0.20199999999999999;0.745;0.053;0.8775;0.11699999999999999;0.8109999999999999;0.07200000000000001;0.104;0.21878078817733995;0.08787878787878789;0.13090200029855206

";61;"I read the book below after a break-up and think it might give you some things to think about. I'd urge you to dig deeper and think about what makes you attracted to someone and what is missing here. Are you not physically attracted her? What specifically would she need to do to change that? Is it a personality characteristic? She should challenge you more, do more exciting things? Are you unhappy with some aspect of your life in general? Is she? Maybe you want to grow into someone else and feel like she's not the one to do that with you?

";61;"Perhaps your anxiety has you over analyzing the situation. You seemed to be focused on that one last box that isn’t checked. Instead try focusing on those other 9. 

Anxiety for me sometimes makes it hard to make a decision, I will have analysis paralysis. Just try letting all of that go and focus on how happy you are together.

";61;"Sometimes you have to break up to realize what you had.  I had this same scenario happen, and it ate at me until I decided I needed to break up.  So I broke up, and a couple days later I realized how much of a connection we had.  I begged her to take me back, and luckily she took me back. We’re still together today.  I understand your feelings, but I think you need to be very very hesitant about the choice to break up.  Think a LOT because if you do it and realize you made a mistake, you might be too late to get her back.  Try to think about what makes her special to you.  From what I can tell, she’s irreplaceable to you.  And that’s very very important.

And yet, I can’t seem to fully appreciate the package she came in and that makes me feel, just, terrible. I look at other girls, and wonder what it’d be like to be with someone else. Not because I necessarily want to be with someone else, but because I want to know for sure that she is (or isn’t) the right one. I am not sure if that line of thinking even makes sense. 

I’ve read up a lot about people who have been in similar situations. The general consensus seems to be that I need to just break up with her. Break up because it’s not fair to her nor me. Because she deserves someone who will see her completely for how amazing she is, and I deserve to be without this constant nagging notion/weight on my shoulders. But, how do you break up with your best friend? Leaving someone that checks 9 out of the 10 boxes (the 10th being my level of attraction), feels like a mistake. It doesn’t feel like its that simple. It just doesn’t feel like the right thing to do – and yet, at the same time, it feels like it is the only option in this situation that I have. I hate this. Hate the fact that I’m here, writing this. If she knew I were feeling this way, she wouldn’t want to be with me anymore. Why would she? This is a weight on me, and I honestly just want a “fix”.

Is there any advice anyone can offer? She is an amazing partner and person. We get along great. She makes me laugh (a rarity among females), she makes me smile, I trust her completely – all of these traits, I know are rare these days, and yet, I am letting my sense of attraction to her override all of that. And it is a weight on me. I know level of attraction is important. But, - this - important?

I [25M] have been with amazing girlfriend [25F] for over a year now. We get along great. She is my best friend. But I am not as attracted as I would like to be, and don't know what to do.;t3_8cqiqd;25;"Hi, 

I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now. We met online via a website where users can share works of writing and art with one another. It was through these online interactions that we were brought together. I was impressed by her amazing ability to write and her mine, leading to us eventually meet up. 

I wasn’t initially attracted to her. But, in regards to the person I wanted to be with, she checked off so many of the boxes, I felt it would be a terrible loss to just write her off because of my level attraction to her. As I said, we’ve been together for over a year now. We have great chemistry, she is extremely patient and understanding of me, very loyal and open-minded, and also, she is smart. Very smart. Her wit and intelligence is easily one my top 5 favorite trait of her’s – the other’s being the ones I previously named. 

With all the said, those initial attraction issues I had at the beginning haven’t completely faded away like I’d hoped. Even after a year. And This terrifies me. We spend a lot of time together. She is my best friend. I do feel someone like her is a rarity in my life. I can sometimes be very temperamental, anxious, and depressed and she gracefully puts up with all these varying sides of me.

";61;"Do you tend to look at things as a constant strive for the better things in life? Can that vision be affecting the way you're perceiving your relationship? Can you say you're appreciating what it is that you presently have rather than what you don't?  

How daunting is the lack of attraction?  Do you feel like you could have (or would prefer better) or has it gotten to a point where you are pretty much impotent in bed? 

I have learned (and should practise more often) that women learn and grow through Praise, and that if there is anything you wish to change, in aspects that could benefit to both her and your perception; is to praise those very qualities that are poor.  Give your woman love and she will grow further into that love, and thus lets say: if it is her body not being up to a sort of standard by what you perceive to be as ""attractive"", compliment her often and watch her tone and receptiveness change.  

This will take time, but worth while.  It would be a lot better than to tell her straight up you're not attractive to me anymore, which would be incredibly defeating and attract the very opposite of what you're ideally looking for, on all fronts.  

Book suggestion as well, could help:  ""Way of the Superior Man"", David Deida.  I read it often to keep myself in check.

";61;"You keep focusing on a moral imperative to avoid appearing shallow, but shallow is just a word that people use to insinuate perceptual realities. You want someone MORE PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE.

It doesn't matter what ""should"" happen, what HAS happened..... Nothing.... You simply became better friends with a woman who will tolerate you but you resent her or yourself for not having an active say. People don't like to feel that they settled, or had no say in their fate. You mentioned that nothing you actively initiated ever worked out.

You are now beginning to feel that sense of regret or confinement to a situation you hoped would work out on its own but never actually solved, physical attraction. Do her/yourself a favor, break up. But accept that you may have to punch up and not down in attraction.

";61;"You have to decide in the first place whether you would be able to be with her in the current situation where you are not enough attracted towards her or not. If you can stay then stay with her otherwise leave her as there is no way where you can increase your attraction towards her as it is a natural thing and no one can change but you can accept it if she is  an amazing girl. 

The best way I can suggest you, judge the relationship as a whole and list out the pros and cons keeping her as your girlfriend and if you think that there are more pros than cons then you can be with her but stop putting efforts to increase your attraction towards her as that is not possible.

I [25M] have been with amazing girlfriend [25F] for over a year now. We get along great. She is my best friend. But I am not as attracted as I would like to be, and don't know what to do.;t3_8cqiqd;25;"Hi, 

I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now. We met online via a website where users can share works of writing and art with one another. It was through these online interactions that we were brought together. I was impressed by her amazing ability to write and her mine, leading to us eventually meet up. 

I wasn’t initially attracted to her. But, in regards to the person I wanted to be with, she checked off so many of the boxes, I felt it would be a terrible loss to just write her off because of my level attraction to her. As I said, we’ve been together for over a year now. We have great chemistry, she is extremely patient and understanding of me, very loyal and open-minded, and also, she is smart. Very smart. Her wit and intelligence is easily one my top 5 favorite trait of her’s – the other’s being the ones I previously named. 

With all the said, those initial attraction issues I had at the beginning haven’t completely faded away like I’d hoped. Even after a year. And This terrifies me. We spend a lot of time together. She is my best friend. I do feel someone like her is a rarity in my life. I can sometimes be very temperamental, anxious, and depressed and she gracefully puts up with all these varying sides of me. She has a degree in psychology and has also struggled with a great deal herself. Because of this, I feel she is equipped to provide support for me more so than many others would. I feel she puts up with more than many would because she can empathize and genuinely does care.

With all that said, I feel incredibly guilty. She’s nearly perfect for me, and extremely important to me. And yet, I can’t seem to fully appreciate the package she came in and that makes me feel, just, terrible. I look at other girls, and wonder what it’d be like to be with someone else. Not because I necessarily want to be with someone else, but because I want to know for sure that she is (or isn’t) the right one. I am not sure if that line of thinking even makes sense. 

I’ve read up a lot about people who have been in similar situations. The general consensus seems to be that I need to just break up with her. Break up because it’s not fair to her nor me. Because she deserves someone who will see her completely for how amazing she is, and I deserve to be without this constant nagging notion/weight on my shoulders. But, how do you break up with your best friend? Leaving someone that checks 9 out of the 10 boxes (the 10th being my level of attraction), feels like a mistake. It doesn’t feel like its that simple. It just doesn’t feel like the right thing to do – and yet, at the same time, it feels like it is the only option in this situation that I have. I hate this. Hate the fact that I’m here, writing this. If she knew I were feeling this way, she wouldn’t want to be with me anymore. Why would she? This is a weight on me, and I honestly just want a “fix”.

Is there any advice anyone can offer? She is an amazing partner and person. We get along great. She makes me laugh (a rarity among females), she makes me smile, I trust her completely – all of these traits, I know are rare these days, and yet, I am letting my sense of attraction to her override all of that. And it is a weight on me. I know level of attraction is important. But, - this - important?

Help?
";61;"Been there done that. 

I was in a relationship for a year with a girl who was amazing and we had a ton of fun together. The thing is though I was never that physically attracted to her. After we had dated for three months she fell in love with me while I wasn't all that into her. It's really funny how that works, when you are seeing someone you're not all that into you act very indifferent. And indifference creates attraction.

It sounds really shallow and stupid but her not being attractive ended up being a dealbreaker in the relationship. Whenever she felt hurt or wanted to speak her mind I never really did listen and took her for granted since I didn't appreciate her as much as I should have. 

I broke up with her since the relationship wasn't healthy for either of us. Now three years later I've been together with a woman for 18 months who is exactly my type and we're deeply in love with eachother. While she's in a relationship with a guy who it seems she's happy with. I'm so much happier now than I've ever been in a relationship before.

So in other words, don't get complacent and drag the relationship on when you aren't into her. For both her and your sake I'd end the relationship since I assure you all you'll feel if you keep the relationship up is missery and regret it down the line.";1;0.01639344262295082;[[0.98251822]];[[0.67473519]];0.9985;0.20199999999999999;0.745;0.053;0.4918;0.12300000000000001;0.765;0.111;0.13699999999999998;0.21878078817733995;0.17430555555555555;0.044475232621784384

First tens months were amazing, constantly talking and always wanting to see him. I would get home from work, and moments later be travelling almost two hours to see him 10 o'clock at night. 

We moved in together, in a nice flat in London looking over the city. Nice area, nice community. Problems started to occur when he was into his hobbies, his habits and I noticed that I didn't... I didn't... And I started suffering with anxiety really bad.

I had anxiety over him and girls at his work, badly. No matter what he said or how many times he said it, I just couldn't believe he loved me and that I never needed to change. Me not having hobbies, or having the perfect body... I was perfect to him. I scream at myself now why this has got to here. 

4 years tomorrow we would have been together. Lived together over 3 of those. 

I love him so so much. So much. We have been butting heads for a while, and the affection has been less and less. 

But now we have broken up, all I want to do is hold him and never let him go. 

I know that time apart either means that we weren't right for each other and it hurts now but time will heal. But I don't want it to be over. I want so badly for us to just have that simplicity of happiness and trust and love with each other. Wth no other, but him.

I know it's hard but try not to focus on getting him back (and definitely don't believe those stupid Ex Boyfriend Recovery sites because a lot of are a scam and make huge sweeping generalisations). I know that sounds counterproductive, but putting out the aura of ""I will do literally anything to win you back"" seems romantic to the person thinking it,  but looks needy to everyone else and will probably drive him further way.

I think it's great that you're going to a doctor and seeking counselling, that's a really positive step! I think therapy will definitely help you to get to the underlying cause of the anxiety! It's just important to remember, you must do this for YOU, not him. There is a real possibility that you may not reunite with him. That is okay, and although it's sad, just remember that the positive work you are doing to improve your mental health and self esteem will make your next relationship better, regardless of who it is with!

The next thing I would suggest is take up a new hobby or join a class. It will give you something to focus on AND help to distract you from the breakup, making it easier to cope while you adjust to being without your ex for a little while! I'd recommend amateur theatre, there's loads of am-dram groups in London! It could also help boost your confidence - I know you have anxiety, but many theatre groups are very loving, welcoming spaces and they won't make you perform if you aren't comfortable with it! Checking out the local music scene is another idea, or finding an art class to join!

In the day to day as well, maybe set yourself challenges. This can be helpful both for combatting the post-breakup-depression and helping you to be productive in your hobbies. One thing that helped me was setting myself the task of learning one new song on guitar every week, you could do something similar like read a new book every week, go to the cinema with a friend every week, doodle something every day!

It's cliche advice I know, but trust me, it does work. Loving yourself is the best way to cope with a breakup. Take the love you want to direct towards your ex and project it out into the world, be extra nice to your barista, reconnect with old friends etc

[33/m] I think I was happier when I was single...;t3_8czuoi;2;"I met a wonderful girl recently. Long, wavy red hair. Bright blue eyes. She's got strong runners legs, a heart of absolute gold, and is ambitiously pursuing her doctorate. I love this woman.

Me? Three years ago I left Mormonism, my wife at the time cheated on me with my friend, and ever since I've been on a roller coaster journey of self loathing and discovery. I've dated a lot, casually mostly, with a couple of strong prospects here and there. But nothing like this red-headed beauty. Her positive attributes cannot be overstated. Three months in and we've bonded well, gone on adventures together, and we're continually discovering (sometimes uncanny) similarities.

So here's where I'm feeling friction. It was only within the last 6 months or so where I started to find my stride. I adopted a ""in a committed relationship with myself"" attitude and started taking care of myself. Naturally an introvert (INTJ), I took lots of solo trips, learned to love hiking and being outdoors alone, and I put lots of energy into the time when I had my two daughters. I was learning to be mindful of myself, to live in the present, and I felt a balance and peace that I'd never had before.

But now, with the introduction of this wonderful woman, I feel like that balance has been disturbed, and I'm not sure how to cope with it. We've set some boundaries (like she only cooks for me once a week, Tuesday/Thursday are my alone days, etc), and she acknowledges and respects my need for alone time. 

Despite our mindfulness, I'm noticing that my health is in decline and my waistline is increasing. I'm drinking more than I used to. I stress about relationship expectations and her needs/wants/desires. I don't want to hurt her feelings, and most days I'm not so sure about this whole monogamy thing, even though I feel like she's an absolute keeper. I know I'll regret letting her go.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not sure if I have trust issues from my divorce and exodus from Mormonism, if I'm too selfish with my time to be in a relationship, or if I even know what a healthy relationship looks like. Am I too introverted? If I see her only a couple of times a week, will she leave me out of boredom, or because I'm not fulfilling her the way she needs? And why, in the back of my mind, do I feel the need to be self-defeating or sabotage the relationship?

Ughghg, I'm sorry for the word vomit. I'm just having a sad/reflective day and hoping that someone else can relate or offer words of advice.

Love you, Reddit.

[33/m] I think I was happier when I was single...;t3_8czuoi;2;"I met a wonderful girl recently. Long, wavy red hair. Bright blue eyes. She's got strong runners legs, a heart of absolute gold, and is ambitiously pursuing her doctorate. I love this woman.

Me? Three years ago I left Mormonism, my wife at the time cheated on me with my friend, and ever since I've been on a roller coaster journey of self loathing and discovery. I've dated a lot, casually mostly, with a couple of strong prospects here and there. But nothing like this red-headed beauty. Her positive attributes cannot be overstated. Three months in and we've bonded well, gone on adventures together, and we're continually discovering (sometimes uncanny) similarities.

So here's where I'm feeling friction. It was only within the last 6 months or so where I started to find my stride. I adopted a ""in a committed relationship with myself"" attitude and started taking care of myself. Naturally an introvert (INTJ), I took lots of solo trips, learned to love hiking and being outdoors alone, and I put lots of energy into the time when I had my two daughters. I was learning to be mindful of myself, to live in the present, and I felt a balance and peace that I'd never had before.

But now, with the introduction of this wonderful woman, I feel like that balance has been disturbed, and I'm not sure how to cope with it. We've set some boundaries (like she only cooks for me once a week, Tuesday/Thursday are my alone days, etc), and she acknowledges and respects my need for alone time.

Went to an event last night, while I was riding back on a bus provided by the event, I saw a girl I’ve liked for a while sitting behind me. So before I continue, I must explain that in middle school, I was a huge nerd and while other boys practiced flirting I no-lifed competitive Team Fortress 2 and did homework a week early in order to have time to furl my addiction to TF2. In high school, I was borderline forced to get in shape due to playing really competitive soccer, and I've attracted more girls' eyes as a result. I still have a bit of a problem of not being able to think/speak clearly when I'm around an attractive woman. It gets even worse when she's interacting with me in amy way. 



Anyways, the girl I liked noticed that I was sitting in front of her and after exchanging pleasantries, she started touching my neck, overly reacting to stuff on Instagram and then proceeding to ask me if I thought she was “extra”, asking what school I went to/grade I was in despite knowing all of this already, and mentioning to her friends who were sitting near her how she liked my type of guy. Instead of replying to all of these absolutely obvious clues she was giving like any normal male human being, I instead opted to browse the days' soccer highlights on Reddit with my fucking earbuds in like an fucking idiot, even though my heart was borderline exploding. I tried my hardest to think of ANYTHING to say/do to not make it look like I wasn't interested in her, but my years of allowing my social anxiety to fester instead of dealing with it caught up to me. My mind was blank. She then flat-out asked if I had a girlfriend, and I, seeing a chance to get the ball rolling, said no. The ball rolled a bit too fast for me, however, when she asked why I didn't have a boyfriend and I said the first thing to pop into my head, which was that I wanted to finish school before being in a relationship, which is not true at all. I realized my mistake right then and there but it was too late; she took the hint that I was so desperately trying not to relay and began to talk to her friends instead. I wanted to say anything, but I couldn't. 






I saw her today and she didn’t even acknowledge my existence when we would usually say hi anytime we saw each other. Now I see the plight of every unfortunate soul over at /r/teenagers. Despite all the signals she sent, I am still not sure if she likes me. I do have her Snapchat, and I want to initiate a conversation and definitely apologize for acting how I did because I am 99% sure I embarassed her in front of her friends last night and she’s mad about that, but my best idea was to ask her about the fucking testing schedule at her school, not to mention that I start sweating a fucking river anytime I go to text heron the Snap.

This is the opposite of what you should do when you like someone. You should find out as soon as possible if they like you too so you can either move forward or move on.

Also I think you have some deeper problems than just messing up with this girl. Even if you started dating, wouldn't you have the same anxiety problems every time you hung out? You should work on your confidence and social skills for a bit. Then when it finally feels natural to talk to girls you like it will be much easier to date.

Another thought: you put this girl on pedestal too high. This makes you nervous and feel unworthy. If you started a relationship with her it would be unbalanced/unhealthy because you would be ""worshiping"" her instead of just hanging out with her. You need to start seeing girls as your equals/peers/friends.

Found pictures of my best friend in my boyfriends porn folder;t3_8d8y95;6;"Both 18M

So, while my boyfriend was in the shower, I decided to fuck around in our groupchat using his tablet. We swap phones and text friends weird shit all the time. Anyway, I looked through his pictures to find some weird meme to send and decided to look through his porn. Just curious. 

And then I saw two photos of my friend, who we'll call Jessica I guess.

Now, my boyfriend had a thing for her around November-December of 2016. They had an awkward not-quite-dating-but-he-kissed-her-twice thing for about two weeks until she finally told him she wasn't super interested. After that he pursued another mutual friend, and eventually organized a group call of pretty much everyone in our friend group, and asked if we were interested in a poly relationship. Everyone said no and I was just kinda like... Well, not interested in that, but if you wanted to just date me I'd really like to try it.

Nothing happened for about a month until we got drunk at a party and he kissed me. We've now been dating for a little over a year.

I've always felt like a last resort. I felt like if he hadn't been drunk, he wouldn't have done anything. 

Now not only did I find two photos of Jessica on his tablet, I found a photo of another acquaintance, which had been in his porn folder on his previous phone too. I decided to just ignore that one because I had no reason to be looking that time other than I just wanted to snoop. He also only had porn of women on his phone (we're both bi guys) and that didn't bother me until I started getting paranoid about the fact that he might rather be dating a woman.

When he got out of the shower 20 minutes later I was shaking. It was like I'd gone through the 5 stages of grief 100 times. I ended up sitting there, praying, calming myself down. When I said ""First of all, I wasn't trying to snoop..."" He looked caught, like he instantly knew what was up. I explained. I told him I deleted the photos immediately. I kinda wish I would have taken a photo of his tablet beforehand.

He explained that that was just his screenshot folder, and the pictures got lost in a sea of porn. It was titled screenshots, his old phones was just titled porn. So, that much was believable. I was crying and shaking and angry and just let it be and had him hold me.

To make it worse, those photos of her were from Valentine's Day. She had curled her hair and he made me follow him to track her down so he could compliment her on it. The only times he'd ever complimented me was just saying shit during sex. He said he was gonna use the pictures to make fun of the fact she looked like Elaine from Seinfeld.

He didn't have a single photo of me. He had two of her. In his porn folder. From Valentine's Day. He also ignored all my calls that day.
So was that was he was doing? Ignoring me to jack off to pictures of her?

He also suggested moving in together in all seriousness about an hour before it happened. I don't know what to do. This happened two months ago, and I can't talk to anyone I know about it in detail...";3;"You have two truths that you need to stop lying to yourself about. 

1. You were snooping through his phone. Even if that wasn’t your original intent, it was the intent to keep you looking.

That being said, move on. Find someone who treats you better than the girl who rejected him. Someone who meets your mental and emotional needs.

So, while my boyfriend was in the shower, I decided to fuck around in our groupchat using his tablet. We swap phones and text friends weird shit all the time. Anyway, I looked through his pictures to find some weird meme to send and decided to look through his porn. Just curious. 

And then I saw two photos of my friend, who we'll call Jessica I guess.

Now, my boyfriend had a thing for her around November-December of 2016. They had an awkward not-quite-dating-but-he-kissed-her-twice thing for about two weeks until she finally told him she wasn't super interested. After that he pursued another mutual friend, and eventually organized a group call of pretty much everyone in our friend group, and asked if we were interested in a poly relationship. Everyone said no and I was just kinda like... Well, not interested in that, but if you wanted to just date me I'd really like to try it.

Nothing happened for about a month until we got drunk at a party and he kissed me. We've now been dating for a little over a year.

I've always felt like a last resort. I felt like if he hadn't been drunk, he wouldn't have done anything. 

Now not only did I find two photos of Jessica on his tablet, I found a photo of another acquaintance, which had been in his porn folder on his previous phone too. I decided to just ignore that one because I had no reason to be looking that time other than I just wanted to snoop. He also only had porn of women on his phone (we're both bi guys) and that didn't bother me until I started getting paranoid about the fact that he might rather be dating a woman.

When he got out of the shower 20 minutes later I was shaking. It was like I'd gone through the 5 stages of grief 100 times. I ended up sitting there, praying, calming myself down. When I said ""First of all, I wasn't trying to snoop..."" He looked caught, like he instantly knew what was up. I explained. I told him I deleted the photos immediately. I kinda wish I would have taken a photo of his tablet beforehand.

He explained that that was just his screenshot folder, and the pictures got lost in a sea of porn. It was titled screenshots, his old phones was just titled porn. So, that much was believable. I was crying and shaking and angry and just let it be and had him hold me.

To make it worse, those photos of her were from Valentine's Day. She had curled her hair and he made me follow him to track her down so he could compliment her on it. The only times he'd ever complimented me was just saying shit during sex. He said he was gonna use the pictures to make fun of the fact she looked like Elaine from Seinfeld.

He didn't have a single photo of me. He had two of her. In his porn folder. From Valentine's Day. He also ignored all my calls that day.
So was that was he was doing? Ignoring me to jack off to pictures of her?

He also suggested moving in together in all seriousness about an hour before it happened. I don't know what to do.

So you snooped through his stuff that sucks, you shouldn't do that.

HOWEVER that is irrelevant now, because you found what you found and you know what it means.  

Best case scenario he is a super creep who jerks off to your friends and makes you insecure and feel bad about yourself.

Worst case scenario you think so little of yourself that you are going to put up with this and stay with a guy who clearly doesn't make you happy.

So Here are the rules.

1.  If you have to snoop, you should already have dumped them.  

2.  You deserve better then some asshat who jerks off to your friends and is nicer to them then he is to you.

3.  You do not move in with him, especailly because you are going to dump him, on account of you having self respect.

It sucks, but imagine if you guys lived together before you learned about how much he sucks. 

Your snooping while WRONG, saved your ass, don't let it make you think what you did was ok.  But also recognize that your need to snoop was your gut telling you to GTFO, trust your instincts more!";3;1.0;[[0.93677564]];[[0.58684534]];0.7755;0.109;0.7829999999999999;0.10800000000000001;-0.4923;0.11800000000000001;0.752;0.131;0.014000000000000012;-0.09350981620718464;-0.0007352941176470433;-0.0927745220895376

My [28F] boyfriend [31M] recently separated, still hung up on ex's everything. Did I make a mistake?;t3_8cvckx;2;"I need an impartial opinion here. My boyfriend and I met on tinder and started dating on new years eve. It was an intense relationship - we texted a lot before meeting, had stellar chemistry on our first date and wound up sleeping together. We established exclusivity three dates in. I met his best friends and mum (separately) within the first two weeks. I just got back from a two week overseas holiday with him. We've discussed moving in. We sort of own a pet together. Point is, we've moved fast. This isn't how I usually roll but it feels natural and unforced with him, so that's not the problem here.


He's been separated from his wife of 3 years (plus 3 years dating, together 6 years total) since November 2017. He was very upfront about this when we started chatting and claimed to have no baggage from it. I was mostly inclined to believe it, because he's described many instances in which she was physically and emotionally abusive to him. While he doesn't talk about her all the time (which would be an obvious red flag), he does talk a lot about the people or events surrounding her, and this is the source of my conflict.


You see, he misses everything about his old relationship, except his ex-wife - his in-laws, her friends, her ex-husband, and especially her son. Therein lies the problem, because although he had already moved on from his ex-wife by the time they separated due to the abusive nature of their relationship, he hasn't had the time to process the loss of these adjacent relationships.


How has this manifested? While he hasn't talked about his ex-wife unprompted, he has many stories about the people surrounding her - positive memories, interesting stories - and he has a neverending supply of these stories that he will share with me. I don't begrudge him this, but it's a reminder about his past relationships that I feel very uncomfortable with.


A large part of this has come up in the form of his relationship with his ex-wife's son (M). Some background information, M was the sole reason he stayed in the relationship for so long, so M is obviously someone he cares for a lot. However, he never formally adopted M, so when he and his ex-wife split, he felt there was no need to explain the situation to M, because they thought it would be cleaner to have his ex-wife tell M about it. Much of M still lingers in his life, however - PINs, wifi passwords, continuing to share his Netflix account with M despite the split.


My conflict regarding M had been simmering in the background since we started dating, in the form of small but pointed comments. When I asked for his wifi password (M's name repeated) he told me and commented how he ought to change it, to which I agreed. When I saw that he was sharing his Netflix with M I asked him whether he thought it was really appropriate, to which he said his ex would never let M have Netflix otherwise. I never wanted to nag him about it, because it seemed callous - again, he obviously cared about M a lot and he was still inwardly processing the breakup, despite claims otherwise.


All this came to a head about one week into our holiday. He had to sign out of his Netflix on all devices and mentioned how M already knew the password so it wasn't a big deal. I broached the topic about how this remaining contact made me uncomfortable the next day. He agreed that I wasn't being unreasonable, but given the opportunity he would like to continue seeing M, and that in an ideal world he would want a relationship with me and M, but he knew that if he had a relationship with M it would mean losing me. To me, this represented unresolved feelings about his ex. I said that the relationship felt like he was trying to replace something and questioned whether he was really over it. We decided that we would see how the rest of the trip went. It was a good trip, but since returning we haven't talked about it.


I can understand where he is coming from, and can empathise. However, that doesn't make it any easier when I feel like I'm competing with his child I don't even know. I want to tell him that he needs to cut contact with M but I also don't want to be setting ultimatums like that. I feel that, like his ex, he needs to cut contact with everyone associated with her for a while before reaching out again, but this seems controlling. The problem is that while he's over his ex, he isn't over everything else, so it feels like I'm competing with his ex anyway.


I hope that made sense. It feels very rambly and I don't really know what emotions I'm even feeling about this mess. I guess my questions are:
1. Am I being unreasonably jealous about this relationship with a child with which he has no legal relationship?
2. Did I fuck up by dating a recently separated man?


tl;dr dating a recently separated man with baggage, do I bail?
";2;"You’re being unreasonable. There’s no hint that he’s attached to his ex. Wanting to still be part of a minor’s life is totally normal and I’d say it would be a red flag if he’d been able to just cut those ties with her son without a second thought. 

You are being unreasonable. He will not return to her for her son. And you are coming off as a little callous for not understanding that her son isn’t her. I get the discomfort! 100%. Id feel the same way as you do. It’s valid. It’s not valid to ask that he not share his Netflix with this kid. It just poses zero threat to you. Zero. 

If he starts to blur the line with his ex that’s a completely different story but we don’t have evidence of that here. I would take a huge step back and understand that these feelings are rooted in your insecurity. You moved fast. You have a lot of commitment without the time to settle into real trust. And this is a symptom. There’s nothing wrong with how fast you’re moving. But you need to be wary of these gripes. There’s no threat here and he’s entitled to these small connections.

I want to tell him that he needs to cut contact with M but I also don't want to be setting ultimatums like that. I feel that, like his ex, he needs to cut contact with everyone associated with her for a while before reaching out again, but this seems controlling. The problem is that while he's over his ex, he isn't over everything else, so it feels like I'm competing with his ex anyway.


I hope that made sense. It feels very rambly and I don't really know what emotions I'm even feeling about this mess. I guess my questions are:
1. Am I being unreasonably jealous about this relationship with a child with which he has no legal relationship?
2. Did I fuck up by dating a recently separated man?


tl;dr dating a recently separated man with baggage, do I bail?
";2;I think you’re being completely unreasonable. You’ve stated he’s over the ex. What’s the problem then? The child is obviously like a son to him, and I would guess the kid probably sees him as dad. Why would you want to ruin that relationship? It seems extremely insecure and selfish.;3;1.5;[[0.9518096]];[[0.52034425]];0.9912;0.12;0.81;0.069;-0.8889;0.065;0.705;0.22899999999999998;0.215;0.11358004240657305;-0.225;0.3385800424065731
F27 and F28 I don't know what to do;t3_8ckpqp;2;"Me (F27) and my girlfriend  (F28) have been together for 2 years. I'm having second thoughts about our relationship everyday for the last couple of months. She tells me that she loves me, but I can't say it back because I don't feel it, I just smile. I mean, I'm not miserable with her. She makes me laugh a lot and we love to dance together. We have no addictions and we are settled down, but there are traits from her that truely annoy me. I will be honest here, she's physically beautiful, but she lacks all desire for learning, for discovering information on her own. She asks the most basic of questions everyday, several times a day and I can't stand it! I have told her NOT to make so basic questions anymore and to search the answer on her own, for example: How long is 6 feet times 6 feet? Or when I'm on my 1 year old laptop and she asks me again ""what make is your laptop?"" or ""how can I make a new email?"" or ""How can I search a person on facebook""? For f*cks sake she acts like a 90 year old and SHES SERIOUS about the questions. Or when she has her smart phone in hand, she's looking for something and I'm washing the dishes and she ASKS ME: What time is it? And what day is tomorrow?  

Again, she is 100% serious about these questions. They aren't jokes. Like, she can't look up information on her own no matter how freaking basic it is even though she is my age and grew up a little more privileged than I have. I can't stand stupidity. It's taken me 1 year to believe that she might not be 100% a regular person. She might actually have some kind of special need. She is a high model. A glamorous, gorgeous, beautiful woman from top to bottom who gets hit on every day by men and women (I'm not exaggerating). Second problem is that she's a very immature woman. Everything that she does, if it results in negative consequences, it is someone else fault no matter what. But the blame is NEVER on her even though it is 100% obvious that it's her fault. This is also a huge problem in our relationship. I own all of my mistakes and take responsibility for everything I do and partially do. She does not. Never. And finally, she thinks that because she is so amazingly beautiful, she should have everything she wants just given to her. With that I mean that she want me to buy her all the stuff she wants. There I have been and still am very clear that she has to make her own money and buy her own stuff. I already provide and pay fully for: the house, electricity, water and all utilities, gas, healthy food, gym, dance classes and everything that is used inside the house and repairs and more. She does not contribute to anything monetarily that benefits us both. I have lost almost all sexual appetite for her.

Can anyone give me some honest advice? Have you had a partner with similar problems?

In Brief: My girlfriend of 2 years makes really basic questions everyday that consume my patience. She does not take responsability for anything she does in life and she also feels like I need to provide for absolutely all of her needs and wants which I have clearly stated I don't believe in that. I lost all my sexual apettite with her and...I don't know what to do.";2;"Her non-action to even try to pay for what is her's proves that she would ignore any advice to be more responsible anyways.

To all my Mormoms and others with advice out there about dating in high school and who could help me in my current situation;t3_8ct2lh;3;To be honest i have no clue of how to tell if a girl likes you. Now im about to get into some personal stuff so bear with me. I am very insecure. I think i am fat even though i am 6 foot 3 and weigh 160 pounds. I think my face looks like the moon even though at the time of typing this i only have 2 blemishes. I am also not a very fast person mainly because of my ankle promblems. I grew so fast that there is close to none cartilage in my ankle causing bone to grind against bone. To add to that i also have asthma so yay .🙄  But for me the scariest thing about dating is my peanut allergy. It is a class 5 peanut allergy which is very high. I have not had a reaction in 16 years and my doctors say im like a timebomb. Meaning the next one i have is going to be serious. What this means for me is that if someone is going to date me and or end up marrying me the would have to give up anything involving peanuts. This scares me to death because i see articles online about a boy or girl’s girlfriend/boyfriend kissing them and they go into anaphylactic shock and die. It scares the living crap out of me. But moving past that its my personality i also worry about they most. I do my best to make people happy and laugh and i usually succeed but im afraid it tends to scare people off and that i come off as too intense. I am constantly trying to change the personality i have and hide it but whenever i do it just makes me sad. anyway all i am asking is for advice on my situation and if i should change my personality. thanks for taking your time and reading this.;1;"Even though im not a mormon (lol) i've got to say your worries are normal for a person your age (i'm 17), and I had the same insecurities. I'll tell yoy this one thing: never force yourself to be someone you're not. Its great that you love to make people laugh and make them be happy, but don't worry about being intense unless someone tells you so or brushes you off. If none of that has happened, then people dont see yoy as intense (imo). Also, from experience, overthinking can lead you to limit yourself bfore even doing anything, so let the natural flow of things flow and dont pay so much attention to it, if people dont brush you off as intense.

As for the peanut allergy, I honestly wouldn't see it as much of a problem in a relationship. If the other person really likes you for what you are, peanuts will be the least of their problems.

As for the dating part, that's the only aspect I dont know much of. Im also very insecure about a lot of stuff amd still haven't got the chamce to even date. It worries me yes, but I won't let it affect me, or at least I try to.

I [28/f] am not sure if I'm being strung along by [32/M] after dating for a few weeks;t3_8d6c39;3;"We've gone out at least 10 times in the past 3 1/2 weeks. We text every day, and he's been very attentive and despite working 2 jobs and having a ton of time-consuming hobbies, he always makes time for us to hang out at least 3 times a week. And they're always very active dates, we go out and do random/fun things. He makes fairly far-in-advance plans with me, such as inviting me to a big fishing trip with his brothers over a month out, and asking me to the be the 5th person in a group season pass to Six Flags, which in my head told me he was expecting us to still be seeing each other throughout the summer. He's very openly affectionate in front of his friends, and brought me to his birthday dinner at his mom's house. He asks me questions about myself, he's very open about his past and future goals (he said he’s a big family guy and wants kids very badly and can’t wait until he can), etc. He always go through with his word, so if we have plans, they always happen and he never cancels. I've met several of his friends who have referred to me as his girlfriend with him never correcting them. I've also met most of his brothers, and have been friends with his younger brother for over 10 years (which is how we met). 
I really felt things were going in the way of a relationship, so last night I decided to just ask. I asked if he was seeing anyone else, or sleeping with anyone else. He responded no. I let him know that I like him, and that I wasn't trying to pressure him in any way, I just wanted to know where he felt this was going, because I was looking towards a relationship at some point, and not interested in just fooling around, and wanted us on the same page.

He told me he liked me too and then told me that while he does want a relationship, right now he wants to continue seeing me and see where things go, and ""if it happens, it happens."" Which totally threw me for a loop, because I really thought we were heading there.

Am I being too hasty by being immediately discouraged, and feeling now that he's possibly stringing me along until he finds someone that he can know immediately that he wants to commit to? 

Is it possible that he likes me, and wants a relationship, but thinks we should continue dating for awhile to ensure we're compatible long-term before committing, or is he just stringing me along? I know his last relationship was extremely rough, as it ended in really big family drama of his family telling him, ""It's her, or us. If you choose her, you're out."" He chose his family, although he admitted he sometimes wonders if he made the wrong choice as he knows they can be dysfunctional. This was about a year ago though, so he's been out of that relationship for awhile, but I wonder if that might be a reason why he wants to take it slow, because I would imagine that could be a pretty traumatizing experience for a relationship.

Anyway, sorry if I sound like an idiot. I just want some second opinions on if I'm wasting my time, or if I should give it some more time because maybe he's being genuine and does want this to continue and POSSIBLY progress into a relationship, if we continue clicking well. 

My current feeling is to continue seeing him for another month, and after a month letting him know that considering I'm looking for a committed relationship, that I need to keep my options open, and that we should end it if he isn't ready. There would be no hard feelings and I would totally understand, I just want up-front communication. Anyway, thoughts?

I'm completely on the guy's side (though I'm a chick) let whatever is supposed to happen, happen. You're testing out the waters, both of you, and I don't see any reason to make things ""official"" and rush into complications three weeks down the line, unless you wanna trap him in a marriage ASAP. 

I understand that you don't want to find out 6 months down the line that he's not the one, but how are you going to find out IF he is that one if you jump to conclusions?

He makes fairly far-in-advance plans with me, such as inviting me to a big fishing trip with his brothers over a month out, and asking me to the be the 5th person in a group season pass to Six Flags, which in my head told me he was expecting us to still be seeing each other throughout the summer. He's very openly affectionate in front of his friends, and brought me to his birthday dinner at his mom's house. He asks me questions about myself, he's very open about his past and future goals (he said he’s a big family guy and wants kids very badly and can’t wait until he can), etc. He always go through with his word, so if we have plans, they always happen and he never cancels. I've met several of his friends who have referred to me as his girlfriend with him never correcting them. I've also met most of his brothers, and have been friends with his younger brother for over 10 years (which is how we met). 
I really felt things were going in the way of a relationship, so last night I decided to just ask. I asked if he was seeing anyone else, or sleeping with anyone else. He responded no. I let him know that I like him, and that I wasn't trying to pressure him in any way, I just wanted to know where he felt this was going, because I was looking towards a relationship at some point, and not interested in just fooling around, and wanted us on the same page.

He told me he liked me too and then told me that while he does want a relationship, right now he wants to continue seeing me and see where things go, and ""if it happens, it happens."" Which totally threw me for a loop, because I really thought we were heading there.

Am I being too hasty by being immediately discouraged, and feeling now that he's possibly stringing me along until he finds someone that he can know immediately that he wants to commit to? 

Is it possible that he likes me, and wants a relationship, but thinks we should continue dating for awhile to ensure we're compatible long-term before committing, or is he just stringing me along? I know his last relationship was extremely rough, as it ended in really big family drama of his family telling him, ""It's her, or us. If you choose her, you're out."" He chose his family, although he admitted he sometimes wonders if he made the wrong choice as he knows they can be dysfunctional. This was about a year ago though, so he's been out of that relationship for awhile, but I wonder if that might be a reason why he wants to take it slow, because I would imagine that could be a pretty traumatizing experience for a relationship.

Anyway, sorry if I sound like an idiot. I just want some second opinions on if I'm wasting my time, or if I should give it some more time because maybe he's being genuine and does want this to continue and POSSIBLY progress into a relationship, if we continue clicking well. 

My current feeling is to continue seeing him for another month, and after a month letting him know that considering I'm looking for a committed relationship, that I need to keep my options open, and that we should end it if he isn't ready. There would be no hard feelings and I would totally understand, I just want up-front communication. Anyway, thoughts?

";1;"You sound exactly like me. I need my alone time, and if I ever get it taken away unexpectedly, the disappointment is HUGE. And then I'll start feeling extremely bitter and frustrated, and will start becoming cold towards my partner. NOT HEALTHY. 

What I did in my last relationship was sit him down and explain that in order to feel my best, I needed alone time to ""re-charge"". That I loved him, but there is just a part of me that needed time for self-reflection in order to feel calm and happy. Of course, the real reason was because I wanted to stuff my face and watch the Office uninterrupted, but it sounds better if you have an actual ""reason"". XD I also explained to him it's like this with everyone. I tell him if I'm with my best friend for more than a day, I start feeling that I need my alone time. So he doesn't take it personally. Its with literally EVERYONE, but he's the only person I could spend the most amount of time with without needing alone time, but that eventually, alone time will be needed.

What I do now is start out my relationships with ""Hey just so you know I'm the type of person that needs pretty frequent alone time, at least a few hours a week, so if that's a problem, please let me know now."" And so far, everyone has been cool with it.

My girlfriend (23F) wants to move back to her hometown(1.5 hours away) has been hiding it from me (26m);t3_8cut3v;4;"Me: Male, 26.
Girlfriend: Female(duh) 23.
We've been together for 2 years.

Here's the situation.  My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years and everything has been great, until recently.  When she moved here it was to get away from her hometown because she had relationship issues (was going back and forth between 2 guys and didn't know what she wanted so she had to get out).  It's about 1hr 30mins away from here.  Most of her family and almost all her lifelong friends still live there.  When we got together she moved in with me and my roommate into our apartment.  We are now in a duplex on the bottom floor with the same roommate.  The problem is that she's incredibly homesick.  She doesn't have many friends up here that she can hang out with, and she's a big family girl and loves being around her family.  Our sex life had begun to dull (not in frequency, but she stopped initiating, didn't dress in lingerie anymore, etc.) and I could tell something was wrong. 

 I've never wanted to be that guy, so judge me if you must, but I went through her phone after talking to her about our intimacy issues and her kind of brushing it off (alarms going off in my head, we used to be all over each other).  I found out that she was talking to a couple of different friends from her hometown saying that she wanted to move back.  She had planned on staying with her mother (whom lives up here and she had moved in with when she first arrived) for a little while to save up money (no rent or bills and such) before she moved back.  She told one that she was planning on leaving one afternoon while I was away at a weekly game night with some friends ( all she has here is clothes, all the furniture is mine).  When I saw this it tore me up inside.  I confronted her and asked her why she would do such a thing and she said she didn't know what she was thinking, and wasn't actually going to do it.  We spoke about it, she's bad at talking about her feelings but I told her that I would help her work on it, and that I hoped she would be more honest with me.  She agreed, and she didn't leave last Saturday while I was away.  I thought all was going to be okay as she seemed a little happier after we spoke.   However, I noticed she changed her password on her phone, I saw her use it from the side and it was different than it had been a couple days before (drawing password, noticed her fingers moving differently).  It raised suspicions, so I asked her.  She told me it was because she didn't want me going through it and seeing anything else that would make me sad again.  I believed she meant the stuff I already had seen and I didn't press any further.  

Today unfortunately, or for the sake of this advice fortunately I guess, I saw her unlock her phone and I found out her new password.  After she fell asleep I checked her phone again (yes I know, I'm a POS. ) and found NEW messages from today while she was at work and had been talking me.   They were to the same people, her bestfriend (24?F) and her boyfriend (her other best friend 25?M)  about getting a place with them down there, and moving in with her mom to save money. There was also a new message to a different friend(M age unknown(one who previously hit on her while he knew she was with me so I'm not a fan)) about looking for someone to watch our dog while she saved up money.  The dog is mine, I paid for her. So I confronted her again, and again she said she didn't know why she couldn't talk to me about moving away and why she was trying to do it behind my back.  

I love her so much, and would do anything for her.  I've told her I'm willing to move down to her hometown with her, provided we end our current lease and find someplace to stay (her/my parents or a friend or something) while we save money to help us get a place when we go down there.  She's told me that she was willing to do those things, loved me, and would rather move with me than without me.  She has also agreed again to talk with me about her feelings, talk about our plans to end our lease and move as well as to stop hiding things from me.  She left her phone on the dresser and didn't touch it since we spoke, so she hasn't changed the password again and knows I know it and could look at more messages she was hiding if I wanted.  

My question is twofold.  Assuming she was telling the truth, what are some things we could do to help her open up to me more, and talk about her feelings?

Second, I'm beginning to lose trust in her words.  I spoke to her about this the first time 4 days ago, and found the new messages today.  Can I trust anything she's saying, or should I be thinking about what I should do when she leaves?

Sorry for the lengthy post.  It's the first time I've felt strongly enough about someone to post online and ask for advice ( I've asked a couple irl friends for help as well).  I love this girl and want things to work out but I'm scared.  Thanks in advance for the help.  It means a lot.";2;"First and foremost, accessing someone's phone/email/social accounts/etc is just not an okay thing to do. I understand the mentality of it - I did it in past relationships - but it really does violate trust. You're 26 and she's 23, you both should be more than capable of sitting down and talking about your feelings and relationship.

At this stage, I think the best move to make is to honestly apologise for accessing her phone (and owning up to it if you haven't. Ask her if she's okay to sit down and just talk things through/get on the same page. It important that you can be calm and open to communicate - sometimes tea and biscuits can be nice too!

It sounds like there's a couple of issues at play:

- She's clearly unhappy with her current situation: is that just from being away from family/friends? is something not right in the relationship?
- She's clearly interested in wanting to return back to her hometown: does she want her own place/space? does she want you to come along but is worried to ask you? is she okay with the idea of it being a long distance relationship? if she what would be a good way for you to see each other (call nighly/alternate weekends/etc)? Who should look after to dog if you do live in separate places?
- Is there anything else on her mind or acting as a stressor in life?

As for how to get a partner to open up it's two-fold. You need to convey that her happiness is a priority, and it sounds like she's not happy with the current situation. You also need to be open and understanding that she may have a very different opinion on what is a good solution, and that you may need to support something that you don't think is the ideal outcome. 

Being able to have these sort of serious relationships is really important. Be honest with your feelings and try to keep them more positive oriented. Be open and accepting of the other person's feelings, even though they can be tough to here. Try put together a list of actions - ideas of where to go from here. If she wants to move back to her town and would like to share a place with you then what does that entail, what sort of timeframe works, what sort of place should you look at, etc. If she wants some space to herself, you might offer to help her move, or agree to call each other every other night or spend alternating weekends with each other. If she's worried about something else in the relationship and/or in general, is there something she things would help?

Finally (and sorry I know this is super long!) you've gotta trust that she can communicate this to you. If you really feel she's holding something back, just say hey I've noticed this pattern of behaviour/emotional change and I just want to let you know I'm here if you would like to talk. Accessing peoples finds or going around there back erodes the ability to trust a partner and ultimately blocks you out from communicating well with each other. 

It sucks being scared about relationships and scary when you don't know what's happening. If you want things to work out though you have to accept there's a chance they wont, and focus on being open with each other.";3;1.5;[[0.97703765]];[[0.73009935]];0.9981;0.125;0.825;0.05;0.9986;0.21100000000000002;0.722;0.067;-0.06899999999999999;0.08815173796791446;0.12589660339660338;-0.03774486542868892

When she moved here it was to get away from her hometown because she had relationship issues (was going back and forth between 2 guys and didn't know what she wanted so she had to get out).  It's about 1hr 30mins away from here.  Most of her family and almost all her lifelong friends still live there.  When we got together she moved in with me and my roommate into our apartment.  We are now in a duplex on the bottom floor with the same roommate.  The problem is that she's incredibly homesick.  She doesn't have many friends up here that she can hang out with, and she's a big family girl and loves being around her family.  Our sex life had begun to dull (not in frequency, but she stopped initiating, didn't dress in lingerie anymore, etc.) and I could tell something was wrong. 

 I've never wanted to be that guy, so judge me if you must, but I went through her phone after talking to her about our intimacy issues and her kind of brushing it off (alarms going off in my head, we used to be all over each other).  I found out that she was talking to a couple of different friends from her hometown saying that she wanted to move back.  She had planned on staying with her mother (whom lives up here and she had moved in with when she first arrived) for a little while to save up money (no rent or bills and such) before she moved back.  She told one that she was planning on leaving one afternoon while I was away at a weekly game night with some friends ( all she has here is clothes, all the furniture is mine).  When I saw this it tore me up inside.  I confronted her and asked her why she would do such a thing and she said she didn't know what she was thinking, and wasn't actually going to do it.  We spoke about it, she's bad at talking about her feelings but I told her that I would help her work on it, and that I hoped she would be more honest with me.  She agreed, and she didn't leave last Saturday while I was away.  I thought all was going to be okay as she seemed a little happier after we spoke.   However, I noticed she changed her password on her phone, I saw her use it from the side and it was different than it had been a couple days before (drawing password, noticed her fingers moving differently).  It raised suspicions, so I asked her.  She told me it was because she didn't want me going through it and seeing anything else that would make me sad again.  I believed she meant the stuff I already had seen and I didn't press any further.  

Today unfortunately, or for the sake of this advice fortunately I guess, I saw her unlock her phone and I found out her new password.  After she fell asleep I checked her phone again (yes I know, I'm a POS. ) and found NEW messages from today while she was at work and had been talking me.   They were to the same people, her bestfriend (24?F) and her boyfriend (her other best friend 25?M)  about getting a place with them down there, and moving in with her mom to save money. There was also a new message to a different friend(M age unknown(one who previously hit on her while he knew she was with me so I'm not a fan)) about looking for someone to watch our dog while she saved up money.  The dog is mine, I paid for her. So I confronted her again, and again she said she didn't know why she couldn't talk to me about moving away and why she was trying to do it behind my back.  

I love her so much, and would do anything for her.  I've told her I'm willing to move down to her hometown with her, provided we end our current lease and find someplace to stay (her/my parents or a friend or something) while we save money to help us get a place when we go down there.  She's told me that she was willing to do those things, loved me, and would rather move with me than without me.  She has also agreed again to talk with me about her feelings, talk about our plans to end our lease and move as well as to stop hiding things from me.  She left her phone on the dresser and didn't touch it since we spoke, so she hasn't changed the password again and knows I know it and could look at more messages she was hiding if I wanted.  

My question is twofold.  Assuming she was telling the truth, what are some things we could do to help her open up to me more, and talk about her feelings?

Second, I'm beginning to lose trust in her words.  I spoke to her about this the first time 4 days ago, and found the new messages today.  Can I trust anything she's saying, or should I be thinking about what I should do when she leaves?

Sorry for the lengthy post.  It's the first time I've felt strongly enough about someone to post online and ask for advice ( I've asked a couple irl friends for help as well).  I love this girl and want things to work out but I'm scared.  Thanks in advance for the help.  It means a lot.";2;"Wait. She’s back in touch with an old male friend who hit on her, secretly texting and actively looking to move without telling you? 

It’s over man. 

Have an honest discussion and break up. She already has in her mind. 

For me, the looking at her phone is minor compared to what she’s hiding. ";2;1.0;[[0.94895965]];[[0.59417139]];0.9981;0.125;0.825;0.05;0.765;0.14400000000000002;0.82;0.036000000000000004;-0.03299999999999999;0.08815173796791446;0.01666666666666666;0.0714850713012478

Does my coworker [30M] like me [28F]?;t3_8dbr33;2;"Hey guys, I met this guy at work a few weeks ago. He's new to Canada because he's here on a working visa from Europe. While he was working with me, I noticed him looking at me, and he would look at me with sort of a soft expression on his face.  Then he would casually brush his elbow or arm against mine sometimes and he talks to me more than our other co-workers. 

Then a few weeks later (which was a week ago) he told me that he was quitting because he found the city too expensive and he was going to a smaller town, which is understandable. He doesnt like cities much either because he prefers the country. On his last day he gave me a hug and said it was nice meeting me and to take care. He didnt say this to our other do-workers, he just told them it was nice working with them. But his reaction to me was a little different. He also talked in a softer tone with me than with others and he was always curious about what I was doing at the moment. He also helped me do work and he would stand close to me while we did our task. I think he is cute too but I don't think we would work out because he is from another country. I'm waiting for him to add me on Facebook and see if we can at least have an online friendship. Do you think he liked me or thought I was attractive?

[24/m] Two months into knowing each other, my first ever girlfriend (26/f) is already saying she loves me.;t3_8cuf2p;5;"Hi everyone. So yeah, this year was the year for me to have my first ever relationship with someone. Before then, I had not even held a hand romantically or kissed etc. Before this relationship, I had always considered myself unworthy of someone romantically. Exactly a month after we became official she dropped the L bomb. I talked about what love means to me and how it is just too early for me to say because we haven't even had an argument yet. I want us to see the worst of each other before I weigh it up and then proclaim where my heart still is.

She actually isn't bothered by this. She knows all about my lack of experience here. I just really don't trust myself with a serious relationship yet. My dad left me and my mother when I was 8 and I still dwell and worry I'll turn into him. I *want* to say love back but I just can't trust myself yet and frankly it bothers me that someone would drop the L bomb so soon into a relationship. She'll be meeting my family and close friends this week as I'm heading back to my home town with her. 

Is saying ""love"" a month into a relationship always too soon? How much trust do most people even have in themselves to keep up a relationship? ";2;"Love is such a personal thing. Since it means something different to everyone, there is really no right or wrong time to say it. 
Maybe after a month, she did feel it. 
I also don’t think you need to have a fight in order to know whether or not you love someone. You will know when it is right to say it, whether it’s tomorrow, 6 months, a year. You’ll know when it’s right. 
Your relationship is not your parents relationship. If you don’t want to end up like your dad, you won’t. You can’t get stuck on your parents mistakes and make them your own. 
Enjoy your relationship, have fun with your girlfriend, and let whatever happens, happen. Just don’t forget that relationships take work. It is so easy to call it quits at the first sign of trouble. Communicate openly, and don’t be too wary of just jumping in. It’s okay to be scared or hesitant, but don’t let it hold you back.

";2;"My boyfriend said ""I love you"" to me after two weeks of knowing each other. We moved really fast, and we are 1,5 years in and we are still together. Everything is happy.

But onto your question: love is personal, you say it when you feel it, and the other should not feel obligated to say it. It's good that you held off, and it's good that she understands. I don't think it's too soon, you say it when you feel it, and you accept that the other might need more time, and you accept that they love you.

[24/m] Two months into knowing each other, my first ever girlfriend (26/f) is already saying she loves me.;t3_8cuf2p;5;"Hi everyone. So yeah, this year was the year for me to have my first ever relationship with someone. Before then, I had not even held a hand romantically or kissed etc. Before this relationship, I had always considered myself unworthy of someone romantically. Exactly a month after we became official she dropped the L bomb. I talked about what love means to me and how it is just too early for me to say because we haven't even had an argument yet. I want us to see the worst of each other before I weigh it up and then proclaim where my heart still is.

She actually isn't bothered by this. She knows all about my lack of experience here. I just really don't trust myself with a serious relationship yet. My dad left me and my mother when I was 8 and I still dwell and worry I'll turn into him. I *want* to say love back but I just can't trust myself yet and frankly it bothers me that someone would drop the L bomb so soon into a relationship. She'll be meeting my family and close friends this week as I'm heading back to my home town with her. 

Is saying ""love"" a month into a relationship always too soon? How much trust do most people even have in themselves to keep up a relationship? ";2;"It sounds to me like you both may have a very different understanding of what ""love"" is. If you got hit by a bus tomorrow and became a quadriplegic, would she be willing to take care of you for the rest of your life? Maybe she would. If this is the case, than I would say: yes, she loves you. Or, does she just throw the word around only in terms of her current emotions? 

Either way, you were right not to return the expression until you have the conviction to to do so. 

A few months into dating my (now) wife, she stated that she loved me over a nice dinner, in a five-star restaurant, on Valentine's day. Not wanting to destroy her, and ruin the evening, I returned the expression of 'love'. At the time, our relationship was just getting into the 'serious' phase, but I still felt it was too soon. On the way home, wanting to be completely honest and open, I opened up about how I felt about what I said, and that I really wasn't ready to make that statement. Everything ended up fine and now we are happily married with two kids. 

I suppose, the moral of the story is: just be completely honest with yourself and with her. She may be the one, and she may not.  

And, just in case I wasn't clear: in my opinion, saying ""I love you"" one month into a relationship is definitely too soon.";3;1.5;[[0.98697908]];[[0.63593918]];0.3165;0.12;0.7659999999999999;0.114;0.9857;0.154;0.815;0.031;-0.11699999999999999;0.09635416666666667;0.2160455486542443;-0.11969138198757764

(15/F) Getting mixed signals from my crush (16/M) Please help!;t3_8d2ius;3;"Hello!

I’m new to Reddit and not entirely sure what I’m doing, but please give me some advice!

I’m 15 and have a huuge crush on this guy (16, in my grade) ITs kinda trivial lol but please bear with me :D

Anyways the other day I admitted to having a crush on him a few years ago but didn’t say anything about my current feelings for him. Yesterday he texted me really late at night...

....................

Him: What do you think it would be like if you confessed years ago and if we were dating?

Me: oof idk tbh. I think you probably would have rejected me

M: if we were dating I think I’d be a lot more affectionate but mostly the same as now

H: I wouldn’t have rejected you. And I like your affection

H: I would have said yes. Idk I feel like we could work.

.......................

I didn’t really know what to do and panicked and changed the convo....

We’ve become really close these past few years and pretty much know everything about each other. We text each other every spare minute we have too. Like it sounds like he likes me but he’s also close with a ton of other girls too. Sometimes he’ll choose to walk another girl to class or she’ll call him when we’re hanging out...

I’m really worried he’s been just leading me on and my self esteem won’t be able to take that blow...

Guys are stupid. Especially young guys. I'm a guy (older) and trust me it is true. 

If you don't think he is some asshole trying to mess with your head, give him a few (one probably won't do it) chances to make a move. Maybe even move the opportunity along.

he also keeps saying he is afraid it wont be like the first time, but dude you know what you did why we broke up  the first time and now you're feeling like you shouldn't share things i need to know to move forward with me..... its never going to be the same, but, you're giving up already because you feel some type of way.

If I were you, I'd cut it off at the knees with this guy and consider yourself lucky. Both of you did things you shouldn't have (he lied to you, you went to someone else in order to force a confession from him instead of having an adult conversation with him) and now you're at a crossroads where neither of you will be able to go back to a place where you'll be ok with one another unless you're both willing to put all of this behind you. That's a chore all on it's own, and I don't think that's something that necessarily needs to happen here. 

I'd try for a break to give yourselves some time to miss each other and to have this adult conversation at a later date when both of you have had time to think about what's happened and are able to come back to this with a clear mind. The other option is to finish it now and save yourself the hassle, but it sounds like neither of you are willing to let go of each other in a healthy way.

This guy that liked me [20/M] totally scared me away, but now I'm having second thoughts [21/F];t3_8cqp7e;5;"Hi everyone, I'm 21/F looking for advice. 

I just had a bad breakup a few months ago after a really serious relationship that left me heartbroken and really stressed. I've kinda been a huge mess since. It took at least three months for us to finally decide we were done for good. 

About a month after the breakup, my friend made me a Tinder, even though I wasn't ready for something like that. I wasn't ready to date someone again so soon, and have my heart potentially broken again so fast. But she matched me with a bunch of guys and I ended up matching with this guy from my high school that I had never met before. He's 20 and still lives in my town.

We started talking, and I told him in the beginning that I wasn't ready for a relationship. He was in a similar situation. Things were nice the first month. We talked a lot, we hung out a few times, and I started developing feelings for him; however, I tried to hold back because I didn't want to get into a new relationship so fast. We had only been talking for about a month.

Eventually he confessed that he really liked me, and that he wanted to be in a relationship with me. He asked what I considered us to be, and when I said ""just friends,"" he said he thought we could be something more. I didn't know how to take it, but it totally stressed me out and it started to scare me away from him. He would get super flirty and say weird things. It was a little creepy sometimes, to be honest. He wanted to see me all the time. He was just trying way too hard. Eventually the feelings I had for him faded, and it got to a point where I just couldn't do it anymore. I had to tell him how I was feeling: I still wasn't ready for a relationship, and it felt like he was under the impression that we would definitely get together when I was ""ready."" I did tell him that I wanted to continue being friends, and he agreed.

However, after the conversation ended, he unfriended/unfollowed me on all forms of social media that he had me on, and deleted all of the songs I showed him off of his Spotify playlist. He basically kinda erased me from his life. It really hurt. He acted like we had just broken up after dating for years, but we were never actually together.

Eventually he texted me and said he just needed time to clear his mind. I said I understood, but I was hurt that he essentially erased me from his life. He said he was just really hurt, and that he had feelings for me that were too strong. He said that he wanted to be friends, and that he was going to start looking for someone else.

And now I'm having second thoughts. He's a really cool guy and I have a lot in common with him. He's really nice in person; most of the relationship-y stuff happened through text. I feel like I screwed things up. I feel as though I built it up in my head that he was weird and I didn't want to date him, but I think I just didn't want to date anyone at the time. My friends told me to just stay away from him, but I don't know what to do; I really enjoyed playing games with him and talking to him about stuff. I think I'm just at a point in my life where I'm super stressed and I don't know what I'm doing after I graduate college in two months. I don't know if a relationship is the best idea right now. But part of me also says ""Screw it, I should just try it.""

Anyways, am I crazy? Should I just leave things as they are? Or should I try something with him? I don't know what I want anymore.

TL;DR: I liked this guy, he liked me, but he scared me away because he wanted a relationship and I didn't, but now I'm having second thoughts, and I wanna know if I should do something about it. ";8;"&gt; I really enjoyed playing games with him and talking to him about stuff.

So in other words, you miss him as a friend.  I think your gut has the right idea here: you told him you weren't comfortable with where he was trying to take things, and instead of backing off, he laid the pressure on even harder.  To his credit, when he finally accepted it wasn't going to happen, he gave himself the space he needed to get over his feelings, but that's all the more reason not to go interrupting that process for him when you still don't seem to feel the same chemistry he did.  Focus on figuring out what you want to do with your life in general, and then you can go looking for someone who fits into that.";7;0.875;[[0.98154068]];[[0.54789425]];0.9838;0.126;0.775;0.098;0.7481;0.10099999999999999;0.865;0.034;-0.039000000000000014;0.10392950440364236;0.16785714285714287;-0.06392763845350052

Don't confuse the comfort of companionship when you are feeling down with genuine feelings toward this guy.

In my experience, that feeling in your gut is always worth listening to, and it said he isn't what you wanted. Don't second guess yourself now.

Our heads think too much, don't let your head get involved too much in matters of the heart (well unless you find yourself falling for a known murderer or something, then listen). The heart wants want it wants, and it sounds like you think you *should* like this guy or that he *deserves* a chance, and have almost convinced yourself to ignore your heart, but that feeling won't go away.

There are lots of good people out there. There are lots of people who are disappointed, lonely, or in need. Love isn't charity, love done right is a beautiful selfishness where both people get exactly what they want and don't feel like it is a compromise.

You will never make an amazing relationship out of a mediocre one. If you are even having this conversation, he isn't the guy for you.

I think I'm just at a point in my life where I'm super stressed and I don't know what I'm doing after I graduate college in two months. I don't know if a relationship is the best idea right now. But part of me also says ""Screw it, I should just try it.""

Anyways, am I crazy? Should I just leave things as they are? Or should I try something with him? I don't know what I want anymore.

TL;DR: I liked this guy, he liked me, but he scared me away because he wanted a relationship and I didn't, but now I'm having second thoughts, and I wanna know if I should do something about it. ";8;"First, the worst thing you can say to a guy who has bared his heart to you is ""creepy."" He did the absolutely right thing, erasing you, to avoid more hurt.

In future, just b/c somebody wants you, even if you don't want them, the word creepy is mean spirited and inappropriate. Human desire is natural, and a person who expresses it is terribly vulnerable.

Girl [20] and I [20] met 4 days ago. We hung out all day yesterday and she spent the night. We really hit it off, but now she says she doesn't have any feelings for me.;t3_8cffke;8;"So I met this girl last week, and we hung out friday. We had plans to go out on saturday, but not really as a date. She casually mentioned she was single, and I asked if she wanted to make saturday a legit date. She said yes, and that whole night we were flirting on snapchat.

Come saturday, we spend the whole day together. We hit it off, and opened up to each other about our mental health problems (both of us have depression, and I also have anxiety). I felt a real connection with her, one I haven't felt with anyone else in my life before. 

That night we had sex. Now I was a virgin up to this point (sad, I know). I got hit with bad depersonalization (an anxiety/depression symptom where you feel disconnected from yourself, like you're watching your life as if it's a movie) while we were having sex. I'm really attracted to her, but I was so nervous I just couldn't finish. I got her to orgasm, at least I think. She may have been faking, I don't know. It was embarrassing as fuck. My whole life I was expecting to have the opposite problem.

We cleaned up and went to sleep, cuddling throughout the night. This morning we were making out, and that elevated to sex once again. This lasted maybe 4 minutes before I completely lost my erection. Needless to say we stopped. As she was getting dressed, she told me she doesn't have any feelings. At all. This fucking hurt. Here I was thinking I had finally found someone who I could be in a relationship with, only to have it blow up in my face. Thing is, she told me she just got out of a short(er) relationship a week and a half ago. 

 I'm not mad at her or anything. I want her to be happy, and if that means not being with me, then that's what I want for her. I know what depression is like, and I know what it feels like to have no feelings. 

I guess I don't have a specific question. i kinda just want to get this off my chest since I have nobody else to talk to about it right now. I think part of the problem is that we took things too fast, before real feelings had time to develop. We were both trying to fill a hole. If things had gone on for longer, the inevitable would have just hurt more. I still feel like shit, but at least I'll get over it sooner (I hope).

Thanks for reading this far, for anyone that did. And ****, if you're reading this, I wish you the best.";17;"I agree with some of the comments that you may have given away too much too early. My ex boyfriend was bipolar and anorexic, but he waited until the point where we were seriously considering dating to tell me. The first few dates are supposed to be fun. Once you build up chemistry/trust, before you become official it's VERY important to talk about any personal parts about yourself that may effect the relationship. But that's for date, like... 5 or 6.

Live and learn. Try going much slower. Girls DO like emotional men and appreciate honesty, but if you bring it all on her shoulders upfront, it may seem like you like her for the emotional support and not who she is as a person. Girls want a boyfriend they can support, not someone they've got to be the therapist to. Big difference.

Also, don't listen to guys who say girls WON'T date someone with depression. We absolutely will. We just want to make sure the reason you like us is for US, not what we can help you with. A lot of those guys use their girlfriends as emotional punching bags, which is why girls are told to stay away from guys who bring on too much right away.";7;0.411764705882353;[[0.95385457]];[[0.69636891]];-0.9575;0.10300000000000001;0.767;0.129;0.9917;0.21600000000000003;0.755;0.028999999999999998;-0.213;0.003860544217687083;0.1269849758085052;-0.12312443159081812

I'm really attracted to her, but I was so nervous I just couldn't finish. I got her to orgasm, at least I think. She may have been faking, I don't know. It was embarrassing as fuck. My whole life I was expecting to have the opposite problem.

We cleaned up and went to sleep, cuddling throughout the night. This morning we were making out, and that elevated to sex once again. This lasted maybe 4 minutes before I completely lost my erection. Needless to say we stopped. As she was getting dressed, she told me she doesn't have any feelings. At all. This fucking hurt. Here I was thinking I had finally found someone who I could be in a relationship with, only to have it blow up in my face. Thing is, she told me she just got out of a short(er) relationship a week and a half ago. 

 I'm not mad at her or anything. I want her to be happy, and if that means not being with me, then that's what I want for her. I know what depression is like, and I know what it feels like to have no feelings. 

I guess I don't have a specific question. i kinda just want to get this off my chest since I have nobody else to talk to about it right now. I think part of the problem is that we took things too fast, before real feelings had time to develop. We were both trying to fill a hole. If things had gone on for longer, the inevitable would have just hurt more. I still feel like shit, but at least I'll get over it sooner (I hope).

Cheating is the one thing that will forever change a relationship, and usually not for the better. What happens if things suddenly start to work out between you and your husband, yet you've already cheated - it's just going to be one big mess that the both of you will never recover from.

So keep addressing it. Keep communicating with him. Make your feelings clear to him. Don't let every discussion devolve into an argument. Find a calm time to discuss this like rational adults. If you said you've discussed this, but the both of you can't understand each other, then it's time to bring in professional help. Strongly consider seeing a marriage counselor, and see what can be done to improve communication and solve the issue in your marriage.

If your husband isn't open to fixing this, or if he refuses to see a counselor, then you end the marriage properly, **without** cheating. Finalize everything, and only then can you consider seeing other guys.";3;3.0;[[0.93643291]];[[0.59048685]];-0.8975;0.071;0.757;0.172;-0.4072;0.08;0.8170000000000001;0.10300000000000001;-0.078;0.16450216450216448;0.09936507936507938;0.0651370851370851

Regardless of who is right here, it shows that your communication isn't clear and needs a lot of work. You both need to do better at this. Talk about it and see why you are failing to have a clear message for things this important.

This seems very manipulative of her. As if she is trying to make you feel guilty for not giving her exactly what she wants, despite not returning the favor with you.

The solution here is talking, not giving into her demands and manipulation. Set clear goals for these meetups. Don't leave anything to interpretation. Then once you've got that worked out, discuss these horribly toxic reactions she is having. Let her know how they make you feel, and ask her if she is willing to stop doing that for both your sake, and hers. Let her answer dictate your next steps.

We had the same argument again today and I said it's pointless me driving up just for one night and a waste on fuel and stuff. I know I shouldn't have said that. But it's not that I don't care about her at all, she means the world to me but we will be seeing each other in two weeks.

She has suggested we take a break from talking a few times so she can focus, and today our conversation has died off and we haven't spoken all day. She's now changed her whatsapp profile picture of us which I feel like is just her way of saying 'well fuck you then'.

I feel like I am in the wrong and feel like a bad boyfriend for not offering to drive up...";5;"When I first went to college, I had a bf. It was an hour away drive to my home town, where my bf at the time lived. I dumped him because I had to put all the effort into seeing him, even though he had a well enough paying job, his own car, super cheap rent (he was 25 and lived with his parents ) and had the time to come see me, but the one hour drive was never worth it to him. I was going to stick it out longer until I met this girl in my class, she talked about how her bf-who had no car and lived 3 hours away from our school in a car- rode the bus all day every Friday , so that he could come down to the school EVERY single weekend, and rode the bus back up to his home every Sunday. He loved her so much that he was willing to do that. I realized that I could not put up with my bf who couldn't even be bothered to meet me half way. It came to a head when he was supposed to come for a Halloween party that I'd been planning for a month, and he ended up calling me 4 or so days before the party and saying that 'hes going to be sick' and wouldn't make it to my party. I had even made arrangements with other friends of mine who still lived in my home town who were coming so he could freaking car pool to see me, but it just didn't matter enough to him to do that. And this is after I told him that he does not put in nearly even half the effort I do for our relationship, but that he was going to have to step up now cuz I'm in college, and he wanted me to be the bread winner of the relationship after we got married. After I broke up with him he 'made an effort' (lol) to win me back ... By trying to finally at least meet for dates at the 'halfway' point between where we lived. But it took him 15 minutes to get to the 'halfway' point and it took me 45 minutes to get to the 'halfway' point. 

Your gf is probably seeing that she's surrounded by other girls in relationships, with bfs who make a much greater effort and sacrifice to see them. It can breed resentment, and also make you second guess how into the relationship the other person is. Im not saying that you don't make any effort, or anything like that, and she isn't 100% in the right (God knows I wasn't always when I was in that relationship too) , but take a look at what you've got going on, and then try and put yourself in your gfs shoes.

Am I [23m] in the wrong because I'm not travelling up to see my gf [22f];t3_8cyxjk;6;"This is our background - 

We are a long distance couple (3.5 hours drive), she is in uni and is in her last year, so she's really busy with a lot of work and stress at the moment. But it's worse because of the fact she isn't on track and has to cram alot to get it all done. I drive and she doesn't have her car with her at uni. 

We have recently been having issues with arguing due to the distance. A couple of months ago the arguments were really bad when we had a 'long' 3 week break between seeing each other. And now we are 1.5 weeks into a 4 week break apart. She was really worried that we'd start arguing again because of what happnened last time and suggested meeting in the middle. I said yes ofc we can do that we can book a hotel or something or just meet halfway for a day out. 

Get to this point and we have argued loads already about what we're going to do and that she literally can't do 4 weeks again because the stress of the arguments will cause her to fail and not be able to focus on work etc... She's said she can't meet in the middle anymore due to work and money. I've said ok that's fair enough we will just have to try to deal with it and not argue.

I feel like I am in the wrong and feel like a bad boyfriend for not offering to drive up...";5;"This girl is just breaking from stress. It’s not your fault. I can say this with a fair amount of confidence because I was in the same place not long ago. All of the stress she has,,The combo of her school, missing you, and whatever else is going through her head is making her confused and desperate. Again, this is not your fault. she is probably just begging for some relief, any kind, from any little bit of stress, but is too confused as to how to find it. 
Her stress levels are effecting your relationship and how she perceives it (hence leading to arguments)
I think the best thing you can do for her right now, (if you want to, this is really going above and beyond) is to try and help her relax. Suggest some relaxation techniques (meditation and hiking work for me but everyone is different). Talk to her calmly and supportively (which I’m sure you already do). Maybe surprise her with a visit if you want (I say surprise so that she doesn’t stress out about prepping for your arrival, but tell her in advance if you think it’s best) but if you are also under a lot of stress, you don’t have to go visit  her - take care of yourself first.
There’s nothing wrong with you if you’re not up to it. And if she is hurting your mental/emotional health, step back! You gotta take care of yourself first. Don’t let her abuse you in anyway. 
I would suggest a few visits with a therapist for her - I only went a few times but I learned ways to manage my stress and stay in control, it was super helpful.  Therapy isn’t just for people who’ve had trauma- it can help you if you’re just really overwhelmed too.

Apology Question;t3_8czvqk;3;"M[37] dated this girl F[35] for two months (short I know). She just got out of a 2 year relationship and we immediately went away together. We have known one another for years, so it wasn't too surprising.

Two months in she was booking trips and events months in advance. It definitely felt like I was a rebound guy but I went with it. Everything was amazing though. The chemistry and everything felt right.

We broke up in a horrible fight which she said at the time that she rushed into a new relationship too quick. It came out of the blue. She called me on her 10min car ride into work, knowing I wasn't going to be able to talk to her for the rest of the night. I got angry and said some mean things over text to her for 1 night. I apologized via email the next day. I like to talk through problems and she just gets angry and disappeared.

We had no contact for 2 weeks and then we had a text fight where she now blames me for everything and that I was an ass the last week we were together. She was very emotional and said 100 times that she is extremely angry with me. She then tells me she wants space and is too angry to even meet me to talk (which I kept asking for). 

We did no contact now for another 3 weeks and that was my path forward. However, I'm now wondering if I should send her an apology letter or something. Or, should I wait for her since she broke up with me? If she really is blaming me for everything (which I think she just said in an emotional rage), I want to apologize for the things I did wrong (and I did do things wrong, but nothing as far as lying, cheating or anything like that). I know what I did wrong in her mind.

I'd say no. It's been a while and you had a twice-as-bright;half-as-long intense high-speed rebound, and then it snapped and she got angry and you got angry and I'd just let it lie. No use stirring up drama again.

Even if you did apologize, it'd be a weak non-apology since you don't think you did anything wrong (and I agree, you don't have anything to apologize for). So just leave it.

If she really is blaming me for everything (which I think she just said in an emotional rage), I want to apologize for the things I did wrong (and I did do things wrong, but nothing as far as lying, cheating or anything like that). I know what I did wrong in her mind.

She's a Scorpio and i'm a Pisces for those who know what that's like..haha

I just don't want to regret letting this one go if I could just admit defeat and move on. ";2;"You can send an apology, but what good do you think it will do?

Boyfriend promised a proposal... and then didn't?;t3_8d9kmm;2;"Some back story- boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 and 1/2 years. We have been living together for three of those years and have a 1 year old son. 

So a several months back my dad was given about a 12 months/18 months to live, obviously we've been all taking it kind of hard about all the stuff he's going to miss. 

Right after the news, my boyfriend brought up the idea of getting married. This is a topic that I usually tread lightly with him, because when I was pregnant we were bombarded with many religious family members who wanted us to get married and now the whole topic is just kind of annoying to us since everyone assumes that since we have a kid, that we're /supposed/ to get married. I would love to get married, but it's never been a requirement for me since I love him anyway and we've got a great life, ring or no ring. 

Anyway- I told my boyfriend that I would like to get married, and that night we went online and picked out ideas for rings, and asked if I would want my dad to be involved in our wedding. I said I would, even though that would kind of fast track planning things. He said okay, and then said that he felt bad but if we was going to afford the ring, we might have to downsize our plans for our anniversary a few months down the line. That's fine by me. He also says he feels bad that it won't be a surprise. Thats also fine by me. I HATE surprises. 

Anyway he asks my parents for their blessings, told my best friends his plans to do it on our anniversary, tells his parents of his plans, and wasn't really trying to hide it from me at all. He knew I knew all of these things. 

Well about two weeks before our anniversary my dad brings up the engagement in front of both my and boyfriend and when we got home that night suddenly he is really upset that my dad mentioned it. I tell him not to worry about it, after all it wasn't a surprise, and he knew that it wasn't going to be, nor do I really want it to be. 

Anyway, our anniversary comes... and nothing happens. We still did the smaller anniversary plans, but I know he doesn't have a ring yet. I don't bring it up that night, I just try to enjoy the evening even though I'm really bummed. 

I haven't said anything to him but all the people he told have been asking us why he hasn't yet and he doesn't have an answer. His parents even almost congratulated us in front of everyone on Easter until his mom saw I didnt have a ring... It's been almost three months, and he won't talk about it and I don't dare bring it up. I feel bad though because my dad had his hopes up to be around for a wedding that looks more and more like it isn't going to happen. Should I mention it to my boyfriend? I worry doing so will only push it back even more. 

Any insight? Advice? I'm kind of at a loss. ";3;"&gt; I worry doing so will only push it back even more.

If he can't even talk to you about what's going on, then marriage is kind of a non-starter anyway.  Tell him if he's not ready, or if everyone else's excitement started making him feel weird, or he's still anxious about not having the ""right"" ring, or whatever else has thrown the timeline off from what you thought it was going to be, you're not going to be mad at him: you just want to know.

Only he really knows what is going on, and in order for you to get what you need, he needs to be the one to give it to you. 

Everyone is waiting for you to do it, and we all know that the question needs to come from you instead of anyone else. Keep the conversation open, and be ready to listen. You need to know what is going on with him as soon as possible, otherwise you're going to miss a chance that you might regret.

One day, I received a message and she asked me who that was and I told her nobody.  I got another text shortly thereafter and she asked me again.   I  told her it's nothing.

Is it possible to still be crazy about each other after being together for a long time. By long time I mean 10 or more years. Is it normal not to want to be together with that person intimately anymore?

I can't say that I wouldn't be able to live without him and I'm not interested in anything physical with him. It feels like a chore and sometimes I just want to cry and be alone.";6;"Sounds to me like you’re finished with the relationship.

It’s okay.

Some relationships aren’t meant to last a long time. You’re young and been with the same person for the last 10 years. It’s understandable if you want to break it off and see what else is out there.

Its an odd one this in that there is no ambiguity yet you are asking the question. You don't want him, don't care if he's around, it feels like a chore and you want nothing physical. This has to end.

I’m not sure how to answer that question, as my longest relationship has been 4 years, and I was much older than 13 when it began...

One thing I can say is that relationships evolve as time passes and you and your partner grow up. Ten years is a long time, but wow - you were legitimately a child for half of the relationship! Even at 23 I still kinda felt like a child finding out new things. I assume he is the only guy you’ve ever been with?

In terms of the indifference you sometimes feel for him as well as the lack of physical attraction, you may have reached a place where you’re only still with him because you’re so comfortable together. It’s familiar and safe, and I’m sure you associate him with many big milestones in your life. 

My honest opinion? You’re 23 - have some fun! Find someone who excites you, who gives you butterflies, who you can’t keep your hands off of. Your twenties go by very fast. Normally I’m not one to encourage or discourage a breakup unless it’s terrible, but i think you owe it to yourself to take advantage of your youth and not just be with someone because you’re used to them. It could be an exciting new chapter!";2;0.33333333333333337;[[0.9651589]];[[0.6442371]];0.5382;0.134;0.735;0.131;0.9855;0.18600000000000003;0.737;0.077;-0.106;0.03465909090909091;0.12083964646464646;-0.08618055555555554

For me i had my first real relationship at 21yo, We are currently almost a year in, and fortunately for us it has been a perpetual honeymoon phase.

We love each other more each day, go crazier for each other, We have never fought. We still laugh so much as the first day

After I fell in love, I fell even deeper in love. Thats what happened to me.

As for you, I regret to say its over, but as they said, dont let the weight of time just make you keep dragging the relationship

I moved to a new city to be closer to my bf since we were in a LDR for a year prior. We lived separately and our future plans (moving in together, engagement etc.) kept getting pushed back because of his circumstances. Just like you, the relationship wasn't fulfilling me. I did everything I could for him and did not get the same attention in return. The breakup was a long time coming and it happened in 2 parts. 2 weeks prior to our official breakup I tried to break things off. Cried to him about how I wasn't happy and I couldn't keep living by his rules without getting anything in return. We were fighting constantly and saw each other less than when I lived 2 states away. 

He told me that I shattered his world by doing this to him. I know it has only been 3 weeks but those words still give me chills. It would've been our 2 year today. 

It sucks, no way around it and even though most days I am sad at the realization that I kinda now have no one in this new city and how badly I broke this kids heart I am also less stressed. I'm not constantly worrying about someone else's life and feeling unhappy. People have told me I do seem happier and lighter. 

There will be those sad, depressing moments but, you have to take care of yourself first. Good luck! ";3;0.23076923076923075;[[0.97209702]];[[0.62719986]];0.5023;0.098;0.825;0.078;-0.9561;0.08900000000000001;0.7559999999999999;0.155;0.08600000000000001;0.3125;-0.04042424242424241;0.3529242424242424

I felt terrible, giving her the advice to just tell him right then and there after I gave the advice, that she doesn't feel the same way and that she can't give them a second chance (lots of stuff happened in between timeline lol).

Feel free to post your own stories if you feel the need. ;13;The hardest part is knowing what you have to do and knowing you'll be better for it and then seeing them looking happy because they are completely oblivious to what's going to happen. I wish there was a way to just shut off my feelings and do the deed without caring. ;1;0.07692307692307693;[[0.97418709]];[[0.64716213]];0.5023;0.098;0.825;0.078;0.7699;0.163;0.79;0.046;-0.09699999999999999;0.3125;0.4666666666666667;-0.15416666666666673
Need to know the best solution!;t3_8czmxa;2;I (21M) have been speaking to this guy (17M) for almost 8 months now and I need to know what to do next. From August until December we got really close however whenever I tried organising a date or to even FaceTime/Call he always made an excuse, in October he admitted he was scared and would try his best to which I said was fair enough and I would try encourage him so we can meet and hang out. In December he suggested a break because we both had problems in life we needed sorting it however throughout January every time we spoke the next day we’d always end up arguing and falling out. February we were speaking fine and everything was good until one day we just clashed and fell out for a few days. Mid February we agreed we need a proper break since the one we had after Christmas just made us bitter too each other so from 21st Feb-21st March we’d have no contact at all and block each other on social media but keep each others numbers so we can get back in touch the month later (we decided this over a phone call). A week before we were supposed to get back in touch he spoke to me on Grindr and said how it’s a ‘coincidence’ and he’ll delete his account and I’ll not see him on it again. The next day he remade a Grindr account got back in touch and we agreed to add back on snapchat and talk again. He told me how absence makes the heart grow fonder and I too believed that’s what happened however as time has progressed I still like the guy but I don’t have as strong feelings as I did at the start. Over easter I felt like we got closer, even started sending kisses in our texts again but then one day he stopped sending and said ‘they’ve gone with the wind’. Every time we speak one minute things look great then the next they look like we’re about to argue again and the way he keeps acting confuses me more and more... what should I do about it? And if there’s a way to make everything as good again like before Christmas how can we get there?;2;"You guys either need to stop this whole thing or if its worth it, really talk it out.

Get him face to face and try to make clear what you are to each other what your feelings are for each other and most importantly how you see your future.

My online friend (23M/Usa) said i loved me (20F/Canada) but I don't know if I should try because of the distance.;t3_8cuk9w;3;"So i have known this guy for about 5-6 years. Right now, he's in the US army and i'm a student in Canada. We mostly talk on ig &amp; messenger &amp; we do video calls only very rarely. The vibe in our friendship had always been one of jokes; it always felt very bro/buddy-like to me (except that i'm a girl lol). He would joke about me sending nudes &amp; I would joke about him jerking off to weird pictures. Also, we're planning to meet irl for the first time this summer, while we're both on vacation.

Last year, while i was in a relationship with a guy, he started telling me ""i love you"" more often. It was kinda weird but since he knew i had a bf i thought it was also him joking. However, about a month ago, not too long after i broke up with my bf he started taking it to another level and talk about ""how he loves me so much"", "" wants to take me out for dinner"", ""marry me"" etc... At this point, i don't think i could have convinced myself he was joking so I straight up asked if he liked me and he said yes. 
When he asked about my feelings I replied that if he lived closer i'd probably be in love, but since he's not i just like him. After that, we started being more real with each other, asking questions, flirting, ""joking"" about us having sex... 
And so he's a really sweet &amp; funny guy and i think i would be able to fall deeper in love with him if i let myself.

BUT

- The long distance is a real turn off for me. I don't think I want/can to handle it and when i told him, he said he didn't want a long distance relationship either... BUT, he also said he's planning on making me his wifey when we see each other this summer...

- I'm wondering if he's actually in love with me. I know for a fact that he slept with many girls but he always says that he loves me a lot and that the other girls ""are just a fuck"". I've been in love twice but i don't think he has ever been in love with a girl (he dated girls at 14 &amp; 16 for no longer than 6 months). Is he being serious? Why would he want me, a girl from another country? Maybe he's just attached because we've known each other for so long? 

- Only my BFFs and ex-boyfriend know about him, but no one knows how he feels towards me. Also, my parents are very strict and if they found out about him, they would probably disapprove of the relationship. (i don't know how much he talks about me to his friends &amp; family) 

So yeah I'm wondering what i should do until and when we meet in real life, during the summer. Give it a try? Reject him? I do like him very much

";1;I don't know, you only get a few people you connect with like that in a lifetime.  Is there any way in the foreseeable future you and him could live closer?  Our military usually only keeps people signed up for two years unless they re-enlist or want to make a career out of it.  Does he?  You'd have to have the same vibe with him in person as online.  Timing is key.  I've heard some amazing LDR stories and also about how it can be really tough.  The thing about being from another country really doesn't matter since you Canadians and us are really pretty similar culturally as far as I can tell.  I think I'd have no problems meshing culturally with anyone from one of the old British colonies anymore than a fellow American.  Likely he feels the same way.  Good luck with whatever you decide.  5-6 years is a lot of time, so whatever you all decide, be kind to each other.  In my experience these online friendships/relationships can be really meaningful.;1;1.0;[[0.97409076]];[[0.58095993]];0.997;0.159;0.795;0.046;0.946;0.126;0.831;0.043;0.03;0.1869614512471656;0.10301978114478116;0.08394167010238443

";1;"Well I get that feeling. I think you shouldn't fret too much about it until you actually meet him in the summer and see what both of you feel then. It's not unusual that people love someone online, but when they meet irl they don't feel that 'click'. So if that would be the case, you're freaking out over nothing.
But if you guys do have a genuine connection in person too, then you'll know instantly if you want to go for it or not. There are not many people you are that close with so you could potentially get something great out of it. I have an online friend who's been dating this girl online for 3 years. They visit each other a few times a year now and they're perfectly happy and making plans to move in with each other at some point. So it is possible but only if it's true love and if you're willing to work for it. I believe personally in things like that, so I'd go for it or at least give it a try. If the distance proves to be too much in the end, you could break it off and still remain friends. But if you let this chance slip, you'll probably wonder 'what if' in the future. I mean, just see how it goes so you don't regret your inactions later. And the girls he slept with, well I've slept with quite some guys too but they were 'just a fuck' for me too. I don't feel anything for them and I still want to be with the one I love and work on something beautiful.";1;1.0;[[0.98260655]];[[0.59421621]];0.997;0.159;0.795;0.046;0.9957;0.209;0.765;0.027000000000000003;-0.06899999999999999;0.1869614512471656;0.13705357142857147;0.0499078798185941
I had sex with the guy I liked after going through a tough break up and cried throughout;t3_8d3u81;17;"About two months ago I (18F) was dumped by my ex (20 M) and I found out about 1 week ago that he had been cheating on me for weeks with a seventeen y/o girl. Naturally, I took the breakup very hard and he went about it completely shitty. Him and his new girlfriend would harass me and rub it in my face that they were together now and itd break my heart every time. Finally I blocked him and tried my hardest to get over him.

After two months I finally decided to get out and meet new people and dive head first in hopes that itd help me get over him. My best friend set me up with her boyfriends best friend and we gave it a shot and went out for sushi. He's incredibly smart and wonderful, a genuine man. We laughed for hours and it felt so nice to feel that connection with someone once again. After that we became inseparable but there was always a feeling of guilt in the back of my mind. At certain times I felt like I was cheating on my ex even though we were no longer together and I'd get sexual flashbacks of him and I at odd times. Itd make me upset and id get mad at my ex because he fucked me up so bad that I couldn't even enjoy my time with the guy I'm seeing.

Fast forward to today, I was on cloud nine with my new man and we were laughing and enjoying each others company. I was finally ready to have sex with him and I was genuinely excited because I knew how big of a step this was for me and I was glad to share It with him. we started going at it and my face was on the bed and he was behind. I was having a wonderful time until my ex creeped into my thoughts. I got those flashbacks and I remembered how it used to be him how he took my virginity and how he told me he loved me.

Man do i want to just slap myself after rereading what I'm writing. 
I began to cry silently and the bed muffled it. It wasn't a big sob or anything it was just the sniffles and a few tears. Mind you this is all while I'm getting my back blown out. I got angry and frustrated because I was enjoying myself and I was doing amazing and I hated how he was still there when I didn't want him to be. I hate him. I hate how he left me so broken. After crying for a bit and acting like nothing happened my man flipped me over and kissed my forehead. The pain instantly went away and I realized that I'd be fine. 

I don't know what to do or what to make of this. I'm tired of him coming back in my thoughts when I don't want him to. I want to fall for the man I'm seeing without having to worry. What should I do?

I began to cry silently and the bed muffled it. It wasn't a big sob or anything it was just the sniffles and a few tears. Mind you this is all while I'm getting my back blown out. I got angry and frustrated because I was enjoying myself and I was doing amazing and I hated how he was still there when I didn't want him to be. I hate him. I hate how he left me so broken. After crying for a bit and acting like nothing happened my man flipped me over and kissed my forehead. The pain instantly went away and I realized that I'd be fine. 

I don't know what to do or what to make of this. I'm tired of him coming back in my thoughts when I don't want him to. I want to fall for the man I'm seeing without having to worry. What should I do?

";57;"TELL me why, behind thee, 

I see always the shadow of another lover?

Is it real 

Or is this the thrice-damned memory of a better happiness? 


Plague on him if he be dead 

Plague on him if he be alive 

A swinish numbskull 

To intrude his shade

Always between me and my peace

";57;It’s completely normal at your age for your emotions to take over during sex. There’s some interesting research I read a couple years ago that said that nothing creates a stronger emotional bond with your partner than sex. So that’s probably what’s happening. Sex helped you become emotionally bonded to your ex, and having sex brought back those memories. Try not to think about your ex if you can, spend some time cuddling with your new bf and be patient. Things will get better, it just takes time.;4;0.07017543859649122;[[0.95409628]];[[0.64315154]];-0.9535;0.15;0.6920000000000001;0.158;0.2865;0.062;0.879;0.06;-0.010000000000000007;0.07900953213453213;0.18376623376623374;-0.10475670163170164

";57;"I'm in/was in a similar situation as you, OP. My ex severely neglected me, shit talked me to his friends, cheated on me, broke up with me twice, and came back in my life a 3rd time thinking he could have me and do whatever he wanted when I'm not around, only to ghost me over an assumption. It was devastating. I broke myself trying so hard to make things work with him. We had even lived together but he dumped me like a piece of trash and treated me horribly at the end of the relationship. I was too broken to function properly, I used to drive around for hours after work chain-smoking almost whole packs of cigarettes. I couldn't sleep.

Then I met someone completely by accident. He's amazing, just like your new man. Fantastic in bed, sweet, affectionate, funny, mature, etc. My ex still creeps on my mind, I sometimes am still hit with memories. He will cross my mind for awhile yet because of the memories we made and the way he broke me. I'm over him, but not over what he did. Every second of every day I struggle immensely to trust my new SO because my ex left such deep wounds. But my new SO knows this and he's made it clear he is absolutely up to the task of gaining my trust.

If you think this pain will impact the relationship and you two are as open as me and my SO are, maybe you can think about opening up about your pain. That you're over your ex, but the wounds he left will take awhile to heal and that may make some days or parts of your new relationship more difficult than they'd otherwise be.

Everything you're experiencing is normal, OP. It'll absolutely get better.";3;0.052631578947368425;[[0.98766222]];[[0.71584575]];-0.9535;0.15;0.6920000000000001;0.158;0.6811;0.147;0.705;0.14800000000000002;-0.007000000000000006;0.07900953213453213;0.022327441077441085;0.05668209105709104

";57;And that's why you don't jump from one relationship to the next. You need time and space to get closure. You need to learn how to be comfortable in your own skin, as a single person. Codependency is the last thing you want in your life. I am sorry this happened to you but take some time off, tell the guy the truth, you can't be in a relationship right now and just hang out with friends without getting romantically attached to anyone.

Don't worry if your ex creeps into your head once in a while. He was a part of your life and unfortunately, we can't just shift+delete the ugly parts of relationships. On the plus side, this experience will help you grow.

Just give it some time and one day you'll realise that you don't even think about him anymore.

";57;"My heart goes out to you. I think I understand the situation and maybe I can give some insight. There's no need to beat yourself up. I'm glad everyone is so encouraging. You seem to be very sweet and self-aware. 

I've helped hundreds of couples and hundreds of people through break ups. This is my experience with memories and how the brain functions. Your belief system determines how you perceive the world and you store some as memory. When you create a memory, you attach emotion to that memory and you also categorize it. Losing your virginity is usually a milestone event which comes with a high amount of emotion. Since you had one partner coupled with this high emotion, it creates a very strong memory. Memories involve all the senses. Having sex triggers the memory of your ex because he was the only one in that category. As you continue to create new memories in this category, you will be able to drown out the memories you don't wish to have. The more you let yourself cry and talk about it without holding back, the more energy/emotion of that memory is released. Holding back only keeps it in you. Free yourself. You have our support and you're welcome to be you, always =)

Time and experiences will help. In my opinion, forgive the ex. Not because what he did is justified, but to free yourself. He's young and dumb and even though it may be hard to admit, you're better for the experience. You know a little more about the contrast of human behavior. Your current guy sounds great. Don't think about not thinking about your ex, focus on the present. When you find yourself wandering, try to just come back to the present. Understand that your brain is just jumping to the first thought in a category, much like the first link in a google search.

Your brain, the subconscious part, only understands how to go towards something. It doesn't understand language, just sensory input like imagery. Example, you might think I don't want to be fat. Well your subconscious only understands the ""I"" and ""fat"" so that's the image often created. It can trigger you to partake in the behaviors to actually become fat. Use the positive inverse, I want to be skinny. It's the same idea, but MUCH much more powerful. You wouldn't go to Starbucks and say you don't want a latte. You don't want a macchiato. You don't want a frap. You need to consciously go towards what you want and your brain will follow.

You are loved. You deserve it. Pobody's nerfect, but we all strive to be better. I'd love to stay updated and you can reach out at any time. Good luck and enjoy life! I wish you wonderful days. =)

We laughed for hours and it felt so nice to feel that connection with someone once again. After that we became inseparable but there was always a feeling of guilt in the back of my mind. At certain times I felt like I was cheating on my ex even though we were no longer together and I'd get sexual flashbacks of him and I at odd times. Itd make me upset and id get mad at my ex because he fucked me up so bad that I couldn't even enjoy my time with the guy I'm seeing.

Fast forward to today, I was on cloud nine with my new man and we were laughing and enjoying each others company. I was finally ready to have sex with him and I was genuinely excited because I knew how big of a step this was for me and I was glad to share It with him. we started going at it and my face was on the bed and he was behind. I was having a wonderful time until my ex creeped into my thoughts. I got those flashbacks and I remembered how it used to be him how he took my virginity and how he told me he loved me.

Man do i want to just slap myself after rereading what I'm writing. 
I began to cry silently and the bed muffled it. It wasn't a big sob or anything it was just the sniffles and a few tears. Mind you this is all while I'm getting my back blown out. I got angry and frustrated because I was enjoying myself and I was doing amazing and I hated how he was still there when I didn't want him to be. I hate him. I hate how he left me so broken. After crying for a bit and acting like nothing happened my man flipped me over and kissed my forehead. The pain instantly went away and I realized that I'd be fine. 

I don't know what to do or what to make of this. I'm tired of him coming back in my thoughts when I don't want him to. I want to fall for the man I'm seeing without having to worry. What should I do?

I've tried many times to make amends over the years to no avail, and eventually gave up trying. The fact that she's decided on her own to speak to me again is a decision she made by herself: I'm mostly just doing my best to listen and be a good sister to her now that we're speaking again.

There really isn't much you can do in this case aside from cutting her out of your life as much as possible. Whatever issues she has with you is on her, and are issues she needs to deal with on her own. If and when she deals with them, then consider letting her back into your life but if not, your life won't be at a loss without her.

";8;"I’ve been there as the younger sister and agree that it’s so hard and painful. As a parent now I agree with the other poster who said it can be so traumatizing for the oldest child when a new baby arrives... It’s likely your parents didn’t help her handle that transition well and its festered over time. 

I would try not to take it so personally.  She’s nasty to you because she wants your dad/parents to (finally) love her. It’s messed up but she sees you as the barrier to being loved (and that’s really sad.) Try to remember that she’s in pain. You can choose to love her anyway.

Regardless, I would definitely avoid her for now and hope that time will soften her - life usually has a way of humbling people right around your sister’s age. My sister and me had ups and downs but over time we came to understand and love each other as we became less driven by painful memories and ingrained behaviors - and more forgiving and understanding (late 20’s for me, early 30s for her). 

A good therapist might help accelerate this process if you can find/afford one and she’s motivated to heal the relationship (big if!) and understand your family traumas better.

Good luck and much love to you. You can’t force it but I always root for sisters! The world often treats women like garbage and pits us against each other, but we can and should do better for each other, especially and forever sisters. Patience + love. Mostly patience though and a willingness to be forthright (and not emotional) if/when she is finally ready to confront her behavior.";1;0.125;[[0.96698838]];[[0.75279768]];-0.9778;0.091;0.768;0.14;0.9964;0.248;0.6679999999999999;0.084;-0.213;-0.19417440960123888;0.08996512746512747;-0.28413953706636635

This doesn't sound like a problem with you being empowered so much as her assuming you are always about to make some mistake.

In the Boy Scouts, there is a teaching technique called EDGE. The EDGE method involves:

* Explain, where you tell the learner what they will be taught and how.  
* Demonstrate, where you show the learner just how to go about it, step by step.  
* Guide, where the learner gets their hands on the task, under supervision of the instructor.  
* Enable, where the learner is left on their own to do the task.

This last one confuses some people. But at some point, the instructor has to let the learner do the task on their own, repeating it until they are comfortable. They can go back to the instructor if they have questions, but the instructor has to stand back. Guiding is over.

It sounds like your girlfriend doesn't know how to move on from guiding. Perhaps if you explain it this way, and say she has to give you a chance to do this on your own, and catch yourself on your own, or you won't be able to do it on your own. Telling you ahead of time is cheating, in a way; you fail the life test. :-)

";12;"She might be hotter than you but that does not mean that he will cheat on you with her. If he loves you then he will not do anything to ruin the relationship but since it is bothering you this is enough to communicate with him over this so you will get reassurance from him that you have nothing to worry and he will not do anything with her. Talk to him and trust him if he says he loves you especially if you have no reason not to trust him. 

He will meet many girls who are hotter than you but that does not mean that he wants to do things with them. He is with you for a reason so you scored higher than his ex so be proud that you have much more better qualities than his ex.

";12;"Two things here: 

1. She's only as hot as you let her be. Your boyfriend is with you for a reason, and whatever that reason is, it's probably a lot better than just 'being hot'. 

2. Sounds to me like you don't trust your man at all. Sure, don't trust his ex, fine. But if you trust your man not to do anything, then you wouldn't be worrying like this. If you know your man loves you, then you also know that he'll keep his hands to himself, have fun on his camping trip, then come home to you. They broke up for a reason. If you're going to continue dating this guy, then you need to get on board with the fact that you're probably going to see this girl often enough so at some point you're going to need to be ok with them being around each other a lot.";0;0.0;[[0.96501986]];[[0.68134387]];0.204;0.099;0.821;0.08;0.8842;0.13699999999999998;0.7979999999999999;0.064;-0.054000000000000006;0.0931818181818182;0.25916666666666666;-0.16598484848484846

Boyfriend [22/M] broke up with me [19/M] and I'm struggling to get over it...;t3_8d0d7m;2;"I don't know what to do. This is the absolute worst pain that I've ever felt and it hurts so much.

We were together for 8 months and I thought that we had a very solid relationship. When we first started dating he was absolutely head-over-heels for me. Our first date was so perfect and special I wouldn't have changed a thing. Throughout the entire relationship he made me feel so loved. It seemed so genuine and he would always tell me that we'll live a long and happy life together. That we'll live together one day and get married. 

We've had a few issues the past couple of weeks about him not talking to me as much and not spending enough time with me because of school. He's graduating in May as an engineer so this semester has been rough on him, and I noticed a lot of changes in him. He wouldn't say I love you very often, he removed me from Instagram. This all started happening about two weeks ago. But he told me that he'll always love me and that nothing would ever change that, so my naive self believed him.

He ignored my calls and text messages all weekend, despite having talked on the phone on Thursday.  He's NEVER done something like that before and I was worried about him. He said that he's been going through some personal issues that he hasn't spoken to anyone about and that he didn't want to talk about it. But that between work, school, his senior engineering project, and the issue, he wants to go on a break until he graduates in May. I was reluctant about it but agreed, because he kept making it seem like we would get back together when school was over. He said that he'll visit me for my birthday (which is the week after graduation). He kept saying how much he loves me and that I’m still his princess and that this will only be temporary.  

I messaged a best friend of his asking if she had spoken with him recently and if everything was okay with him. He wasn’t acting like himself and I wasn’t sure what was going on. During our phone call on Thursday, he said that he had a break down at school from the amount of stress that he was under. I thought that he wasn’t responding/wasn’t online at all because he might have done something stupid with the amount of stress he was under. I thought he was acting weird because his “issue” was that he was depressed.

She didn't even click on the messages but he knew about it. I'm assuming she took a screenshot of her lock screen and sent it to him, because it didn’t show that the messages were read (it was over Facebook). Thirty minutes later he messages me telling him to stop messaging his friends or he's going to block me. I asked him why he has been ignoring my messages and calls for the past three days and he told me to leave him alone and that he’s broken up with me. That he doesn’t owe me anything. I told him that he told me we were only going to be on a break until school was over, and he responded by saying that he doesn’t love me anymore. That all of his feelings are gone. I asked him why he told me that he would never stop loving me last week if that wasn’t the case, and he gave me the stupid answer of “I don’t know they’re just not there anymore.”

I feel so lost and hopeless and confused. I was his first serious girlfriend and his first love, and he was my first love and he took my virginity from me. I genuinely thought that he wanted to be with me, but I don’t know what to make of all of this. It was so hard to find someone that I liked as much as I liked him. It took me almost two years to find a boyfriend as amazing as him, and for some reason he changed into a completely different person. He became so cold to me and I don’t understand why he had to be so harsh about it. I feel played and that I won’t be able to trust another guy with my feelings in the future. This is the third time that I’ve gone through a breakup similar to this, and they were just as messy.

TLDR; Boyfriend of 8 months was incredibly sweet and loving and it seemed like nothing was wrong. He asked for a break on Thursday because of stress from school then he ignored me all weekend. Broke up with me today and told me he doesn’t love me anymore.";1;You're still so young. This just happened to me on Thursday and I'm 30 and was living with him. I know it doesn't hurt any less for you and you have all of these unanswered questions bc he just said he loved you and now suddenly he doesn't and I'm sure u have that awful feeling in the pit of your stomach- heartbreak is brutal. Here is what I know for sure- he loves you. Regardless of what he says, right now he's pushing you away. So the last thing you want to do is bother him. Think of it this way, if your parents are annoying you and you ask them to leave you alone and they don't- it only makes things worse right ? So for YOUR own sanity,  go completely silent- don't bombard him with texts begging for answers, and don't call him. Give it a week. I bet he will change his tune and reach out to you- and if he doesn't, you are a lucky girl bc men who react this way will do so for the rest of their lives. And you don't want to live with that. ;3;3.0;[[0.9810654]];[[0.62795524]];-0.9958;0.07400000000000001;0.779;0.147;-0.9166;0.073;0.7929999999999999;0.134;-0.011999999999999985;0.11596270242103572;0.0052346776030986406;0.11072802481793707

I [27M] felt weird when I was alone with my friend [26F]. Is this sexual tension?;t3_8d3jif;2;"Hi [r/relationship\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice), long story short, I just recovered from a terrible few months of suicidal depression where I had no human contact and I lost a lot of my already lacking social skills during that time. After I got back up from my feet, I started socializing again and a few days ago, I was hanging out with one of my friends whom I've not seen in a while.

We were having dinner and a 420 session with just the two of us . I kind of felt weird after dinner when we were just sitting down and talking. Our conversations were just basically about how busy we were, asking about our exes \(we both broke up with our exes semi\-recently due to ldr\) and she asked me if I could come cook for her again. We watched a show afterwards sit out the high.

To try and describe this funny feeling I had: Something inside me told me to make a move on her while another thing inside me is telling me that it's not a smart idea. And no, this doesn't feel like the normal urge you sometimes get when you talk to a girl at a party, it felt really strong and I felt like I ""cut the tension in the room with a knife"". Is this, sexual tension I'm feeling? If it is sexual tension, how do I know if it's mutual, and if it is mutual, how do I act on it?

I [18/f] was kissed by my friend [26/M] who I've known since I was 15. Any advice?;t3_8d2scd;3;"I previously posted a really long, detailed version of the backstory leading up to the kiss (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8cu0rf/i_18f_was_kissed_by_my_guy_friend_and_tutor_26m/). Looking for new advice due to the message he sent me last night (I opened it this morning). I received lots of positive responses and I would like to thank everyone for replying. Now, I'm seeking advice on the updated situation. Thank you all for helping me along :)


In short, I met the guy who is 26, when I was 15 (he was 22) through a volunteer program we did together. He's handsome, smart, and kind and as a result, I developed a crush on him although I still saw him as my mentor/someone I look up to. I ended up going to the same college as he did and he's now a grad student at the same college. We lost touch over my senior year summer but rekindled our relationship when we randomly ran into eachother on campus one day. After catching up over a cup of coffee, I redeveloped feelings for him, although I brushed it off as an infatuation. 

Fast-foward a couple of weeks, he becomes my tutor (not paid, just a friend helping out a friend) in CS and our friendship blossoms as a result. Then yesterday, suddenly, he kisses me while we were sitting in a secluded spot on campus. It was a super chaste kiss, even tentative. It totally caught me off guard though and I quickly fled the scene without saying anything after conveniently receiving a phone call from my mom. I have to stress that he has always been extremely professional and has never over-stepped any boundaries. Plus, he's never shown any indication that he likes me/is flirting with me. 

I refused to check my phone for the remainder of the night but gave in to my anxiety in the morning. He didn't call me a single time, just sent a long text message. Not sure if him not calling is a respectful move or a red flag though. The text message basically started off with a sincere-sounding apology. He said he was extremely sorry that he kissed me without my permission and that it was uncalled for and innapropriate. He also said that he felt a bit out of control and that he didn't rationally think through his action before he did it, to which he apologized again for. He says he hopes that I can forgive him but absolutely understands that I need space. Then he said good night. The message was a lot more formal in tone compared to our other ones. He didn't mention anything about having feelings for me, once again respectful or red flag? So now I'm even more confused. Seems like he kissed me because the moment felt right. Either that or he's hesitating to admit to any feelings because he's afraid it'll push me away? 

Anyway, not sure what my next step should be. My heart is all giddy because of my crush on him and I want to text him back to tease his feelings for me, if he has any, out of him. But my mind is telling me to not respond because it's extremely creepy for a 26yo, nonetheless a successful and handsome grad student, to be interested in an 18yo girl who's basically still a teenager. I would consider myself mature for my age but still.  

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you all! Don't know what I'd do without the all the redditor's unbiased opinions. 

TL;DR: My [18f] guy friend and tutor [26m] who I've known since I was 15 and now go to college with, decided to kiss me randomly during one of our tutoring sessions. He messaged me after I fled the scene that he was extremely sorry and that his actions were inappropriate. He also said it was an impulsive decision and very ""spur of the moment"".  ";1;You need to talk to him and let him know you like him too and that you are down to pursue a romantic relationship with him.  He isn't psychic and your reaction after you kissed him probably made him think he fucked up and you rejected him and think he's a predator of some kind.

Any advice?;t3_8d2scd;3;"I previously posted a really long, detailed version of the backstory leading up to the kiss (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8cu0rf/i_18f_was_kissed_by_my_guy_friend_and_tutor_26m/). Looking for new advice due to the message he sent me last night (I opened it this morning). I received lots of positive responses and I would like to thank everyone for replying. Now, I'm seeking advice on the updated situation. Thank you all for helping me along :)


In short, I met the guy who is 26, when I was 15 (he was 22) through a volunteer program we did together. He's handsome, smart, and kind and as a result, I developed a crush on him although I still saw him as my mentor/someone I look up to. I ended up going to the same college as he did and he's now a grad student at the same college. We lost touch over my senior year summer but rekindled our relationship when we randomly ran into eachother on campus one day. After catching up over a cup of coffee, I redeveloped feelings for him, although I brushed it off as an infatuation. 

Fast-foward a couple of weeks, he becomes my tutor (not paid, just a friend helping out a friend) in CS and our friendship blossoms as a result. Then yesterday, suddenly, he kisses me while we were sitting in a secluded spot on campus. It was a super chaste kiss, even tentative. It totally caught me off guard though and I quickly fled the scene without saying anything after conveniently receiving a phone call from my mom. I have to stress that he has always been extremely professional and has never over-stepped any boundaries. Plus, he's never shown any indication that he likes me/is flirting with me. 

I refused to check my phone for the remainder of the night but gave in to my anxiety in the morning. He didn't call me a single time, just sent a long text message. Not sure if him not calling is a respectful move or a red flag though. The text message basically started off with a sincere-sounding apology. He said he was extremely sorry that he kissed me without my permission and that it was uncalled for and innapropriate. He also said that he felt a bit out of control and that he didn't rationally think through his action before he did it, to which he apologized again for. He says he hopes that I can forgive him but absolutely understands that I need space. Then he said good night. The message was a lot more formal in tone compared to our other ones. He didn't mention anything about having feelings for me, once again respectful or red flag? So now I'm even more confused. Seems like he kissed me because the moment felt right. Either that or he's hesitating to admit to any feelings because he's afraid it'll push me away? 

Anyway, not sure what my next step should be. My heart is all giddy because of my crush on him and I want to text him back to tease his feelings for me, if he has any, out of him. But my mind is telling me to not respond because it's extremely creepy for a 26yo, nonetheless a successful and handsome grad student, to be interested in an 18yo girl who's basically still a teenager. I would consider myself mature for my age but still.  

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you all! Don't know what I'd do without the all the redditor's unbiased opinions. 

TL;DR: My [18f] guy friend and tutor [26m] who I've known since I was 15 and now go to college with, decided to kiss me randomly during one of our tutoring sessions. He messaged me after I fled the scene that he was extremely sorry and that his actions were inappropriate. He also said it was an impulsive decision and very ""spur of the moment"".  ";1;"You are a college student. The mean age of successful relationships puts the guy 5 years older, with a standard deviation of roughly 2. 

He probably felt something intangible if you've had this crush that you thought you weren't showing. Now he feels like he misread all the signals and doesn't know how to find his way back to safe ground. 

Whatever else may come, I kinda think you owe him and yourself a decent conversation. 

Maybe it starts with ""I wanted to kiss you back, but I freaked..."" or some such. Either that or, ""you are right, this is inappropriate. I like you. Maybe too much. We shouldn't see each other for awhile."" 

Pick your poison, but it is most definitely your move. Good luck.";1;1.0;[[0.9727083]];[[0.55420039]];0.9967;0.155;0.787;0.059000000000000004;0.9373;0.166;0.778;0.055;-0.015000000000000013;0.09215784215784216;0.1707217261904762;-0.07856388403263405

I (22F) with my ex(about to be 26,M): in need of advise on how to interpret the last few events of our spastic relationship so I can learn how to handle my anger better *SUPER LONG*;t3_8d7i81;2;"tl;dr:
Relationship with bipolar ex was a whirlwind 6 months in a transitory period of my life. He was sweet and very intelligent but tendencies that irritated me and eventually led to him crossing boundaries. I need advice on how I could have handled the situation better (as I have a tendency to be quick to anger) and if I was right to cut it off so “quick”. 

Body: 
Alright u/relationships, I’m here seeking your expertise and to be hit in the head with some truth. This sub tends to not have much tolerance for relationships lacking communication, its advice has nurtured my own skills and has motivated/directed my energy to putting work into this past relationship. I’m hoping I can learn and process the events that transpired yesterday with your guys’ collective advice. Onward to the... dilemma/event/story.

Background:
I met my ex, lets call him C, on tinder in July around my bday. whoop whoop. I initially wasn’t taken with him and actually had a small fling with someone else before meeting up with him 3 months later. C kept my interest by talking business and recommending books for me to read that I really enjoyed. 

Once the fling fizzled out, I decided to meet with him in person around October. We met twice before becoming taken with one another and shortly after got into a relationship. The second date, (now around November) C accompanied me to find a room to rent and ended up engaging the leaser and getting me the place. I saw for the first time his energy and was attracted to how he at ease he was at talking (hahahaha this becomes a problem later, read on!). The conversation lasted three hours and touched on a plethora of subjects; it was sublime. 

When we left, C asked if I would like to head to his place to continue talking and after my objection of not wanting to have sex so quick, emphasized wanting to get to know me. I agreed and from there the relationship took off.  I helped C move into a new place 2/3 days later and stayed with him for a full week before moving out to my place. Moving out of my parents to my own place is a whole other story of its own (skip next paragraph if you dont want the details).

But short version: abusive parents kicked me out of the house late November, went through my things and recorded me as I picked up my stuff for “legal purposes”. I contained my anger, but at one point I had to run out to C to calm myself. He said that the fact I could stop myself so quickly when I recognized the consequences of my anger  was a sign that we could make this relationship work. 

I met his friends really quickly and grew to love them and form my own friendships with them... which of course I no longer have. His two roommates were his best friend from college and the friend’s cousin, the three were part of a larger, tight friend group that frequently spent time together. In January, I had to temporarily stay at his place and made sure I was the best guest there was. I paid half C’s share of rent and contributed to household supplies. My OCD also made sure the place was spotless and that the boys were all fed. It was a fun time for sure. 

Things started spiraling last month in March. I got a new job that required me to work 10 hour days. My commute is an hour and a half (by public transportation) so that means I have no time to really do anything else. Conveniently, C lives 5 mins from my work, and I live 15 mins from his work. I would hop over to his place and spend the night with him to make my commute easier, or vice versa we would stay at my place so it would be easier for him to get to work. 

C, for all his bipolar tendencies, was a sweet man. He was patient and never quick to anger. Our time together was conversational. Both of us are hardworking potheads that like to discuss life’s  paradigms and solve problems together. 

However, It was hard to be productive around him as C could not stop talking. It was constant. When I asked for space or silence, he had a very difficult containing himself and would begin a conversation. We developed a system where if one of us said JKS, then that meant take a breath, the other needs time apart. We had several conversations on this and I thought I was seeing improvement. C was adamant that he wanted to become a better person so we worked together to set better habits. I thought I finally found someone I could have a synergistic relationship with. Ok background done...

Sorry for all that, I know this is long. I put in a lot of effort to understand this man and I want to make sure I set the context aptly enough to gain further insight. I know I have things to work on, mainly enforcing my boundaries, but some insight on how to do that would be helpful. 

The Events That Les to the Break Up:
I will try and cut this up into short paragraphs describing the several events that transpired and led me to cut off one of the best relationships I ever had. 

1)This one is mostly my fault, but C’s reaction to it should have been a major red flag for me... or should it have? You tell me. I actually am unsure of how bad this one is as C used to hold it over my head frequently and it warped my perception of the events. 

C was out of state for work for a week and I had not yet started my new job. I invited a guy friend I knew from hs over to come smoke and hang after his shift ended around 4 I notified C that a “friend” was coming over to hang for an hour to catch up as I hadn’t seen him in several months. 

He came over again the next day while my brother and one of Cs roomies where there. I let C know again that a “friend” was coming over. He inquired into the sex of the friend and when I said male got very upset. I told him that he had nothing to worry about, the only connection the dude I had was making out a couple times several years ago. Since then we have elected to just be friends and have stayed as such. 

C could not let go of the fact that I invited a guy friend over and not inform him specifically that it was a male. I apologized and told him that I was unsure how he would react if i told him it was a guy friend. That was my mistake and I realize that I should have been upfront from the beginning. My actions were undoubtedly shady in that moment.

We talked and worked out that I should be more explicit when communicating with him and I thought things were good. I even invited my friend and his group to come over and pregame before a rave so my bf could meet him and subdue his anxiety. 

2)Several weeks later, I went to his place after a stressful day of work one night seeking comfort and rest. I explicitly asked C if I could come over to sleep as I didnt think I could make the commute safely. He excitedly agreed and was so kind to pick me up from work. After smoking a bowl, I headed upstairs to get ready for bed. C accompanied me up and sparked conversation as I was going through my routine. I got into bed and asked for silence. C got into bed with me and cuddled for 5 mins before starting to talk. I shhhhed he fell silent. 

Not more than 5 mins later, he starts kissing my head which leads him to want to make out with me. I tell him no and try to go back to sleep. After he repeated this cycle a couple more times I sat up and tried to talk with him to make him realize how manic he was in that moment. He excused his actions by saying he loved me so much he couldnt help himself when he looked at me. He just had to kiss me. 

I told him that was not ok but the convo somehow turned into three hours of me having to explain how that was not ok. 

3)In the same week, I was invited to go dancing with a friend and various others she decided to invite after work. I let C know my plans and told him about her. I had met her months back and hadn’t really gotten to know her. All I knew was that she was fun to be around and she happened to like girls. No biggie, the friend group she was with was all lesbians as well as I found out later when I met them. I did tell C explicitly, like we discussed, and went full disclosure on how we met. 

C’s paranoia got the better of him and as I got home from work to get ready to go out, he asked straight up if I was cheating with her. I had not seen this girl in months, I hardly talk with her. She randomly reached out and asked if I was free. I don’t go out much and don’t really have girl friends to go dancing with so I was down! I wanted a night free of boys so I wouldn’t have to worry about getting hit on ironically enough. His direct jump to cheating made me angry and I was curt in my reply back to him. I didn’t text him for the rest of my night. 

These events formed the catalyst that inspired a week long break from seeing one another. I asked him to be introspective and figure out what he wanted for himself, with his life, because I thought his mania stemmed from his insecurities. If he were to find other things to do like working out or tinkering with something, instead of talking then perhaps he could curb his impulses and gain some confidence. Dope we took the week off, talked, and things resumed. 

4)C has exs that cheated on him and as such has a huge paranoia I would do the same to him.. even though i literally texted &amp; snapped him all the time and was at his place every weekend. When would I ever have the time?? And as you can see, he has projected that paranoia several times in our relationship. 

Three weeks ago, one tuesday night, as we were both getting ready for bed, some random dude snapped me and engaged in convo for 15 mins. He was annoying and I was replying back to rebuff him because I was being immature and wanted to get a rise out of the random dude for daring to bother me so late. Yes I see the illogicality of that last statement and it is what made C upset. He shut down and got a little abrasive. We went to bed after I apologized and blocked the rando. 

I couldnt fall asleep cause C snores so freaking loud and went to sleep downstairs. This was normal for me as I am a light sleeper and had a hard time falling asleep. C woke me up around 5:30 to ask if I was cheating with the dude I blocked. I was tired and groggy, and I snapped at him. I yelled out in anger that I refused to manage his emotions and how could he think to wake me knowing we both had long days ahead of us. Why couldnt he have addressed this in the morning, why did it have to be right that second? I couldnt contain myself anymore. We JKS’d for a day and I decided I couldnt put up with this any longer. I broke up with him on Wednesday and discussed a bit why I was. 

4b)Thursday, I reached out to him after mulling over all the happy memories we shared and asked if we could set a date to reach out and talk again. I didn’t want to lose someone that was so impactful in my life. I stated that I wanted him to take the time to form better habits and think about the boundaries I set. 

4c)For a week and a half, his roommates worked with him to go to the gym and get the house clean, he started going out on the weekends. (I found this out later as we were not talking.) I reached out to the roomies to check up on C because I was miserable. I was a wreck, I knew I would not be able to take the whole month without talking to him, suffering in the ambiguity. That day, I texted him asking how he was and we resumed talking. Things were ok, we were doing what we needed to independently and it was nice to go back to the fun convos we had. I felt stable. 

He asked to see me this past Sunday and I agreed because I loved that boy so much. We spent a great day having sex, walking in the park, eating junk food, and enjoying each others time. He seemed more composed and apt to let me talk. C even left to go home and give me space for the night. It was great! 

This is where I went made my most egregious mistakes. 

5)Monday I ask C to pick up some ganja for me because I knew he needed some and was likely to go for himself. He offered to pick me up after work and hand it over and then drop me off at bart so I could commute home. When he came to pick me up he stated he needed gas so we stopped along the way. During that time, something switched in his head and he stated he wanted to drive me home to workout with me. 

I should have stuck to the plan but I wanted him to make a decision and follow through with it. He was so indecisive and eventually I got fed up and told C to go to his house where I would lyft to bart. I angrily stalked off and texted him when I got home to cancel plans we had that Sat. His indecision added 20 extra mins to my commute :/ I was pissed. But reflecting back on that, I should have told him to stick to the plan and went home. I was wrong in how I reacted to him and I wish I was more patient with him. I went to the gym and worked out my anger and apologized to him for my impatience.

6)His abusive boss sent him home mid-day yesterday so I asked if we could lunch together. Towards the end, I was feeling sleepy so I asked if we could cuddle and nap for 20 mins before I went to work. We slept for 5 mins before he began talking. I shhhed him. 5 mins later he starts kissing me. I got upset but knowing what happened the night before, I curbed my emotions and asked him why he thought it was ok to kiss me when I asked to sleep. He again told me that in looking at me all he could do was kiss me. He seemed very upset and down, but I pushed forward establishing my boundaries. He apologized and thanked me for being patient with him.

7)The alarm rang shortly after and I sprang out of bed. I told C I would put my shoes on in the car because I would otherwise be late to work. We went downstairs and as he was literally walking through the door frame, he turned around and started to tell his roommates about last night when he drove off from the gas station possibly with the spout thingy still attached. I urged him to hurry up with a quick “babe. come on babe”. 

C was able to stop talking and told them he would tell them later. In the car, I was so upset. We had just talked about him being more aware around me and the fact that he forgot not more than 2 mins later was ridiculous. 

In the car, he said he was sorry but I was at my ends limits. Maybe I was asking too much of him? The way he lived his life was so different than mine. We are both college grad working full time jobs but after my 10 hour day, I still go to the gym and cook dinner. He claimed he was burnt out and did not habe much going in his life except work and friends before he met me. Hr claimed to want to change that as he used to be more of a hustler. I was always thinking of his needs and how I could make his life easier, but it didnt seem like he could do the same for me in the smallest way that mattered. I told him as such and he couldnt take the criticism.

What blew me over the top and sealed the deal was when he said i was too critical of him. I told him maybe it was because he wasnt actually addressing the issues I brought up. All we ever did was talk, thats all I saw from him. 

So if you are still here, please tell me. Was this relationship doomed from the start or did we stand a chance if I was more patient? I rushed things in the end and expected a lot of change within two weeks. I get that, but I feel like he was so unaware of what he was doing to me that it wasnt worth it. Was his bipolarness and adhd why he acted the way he did? Was I being reasonable in my requests?

";1;I don’t want to say it was doomed from the start, but it seems to me like there are things about y’all that just don’t click and I can’t see any amount of time changing that.  It seemed if anything that it was escalating and getting worse like you were getting more and more frustrated.  Maybe you both need to learn to compromise more in certain areas. As far as the paranoia it seems like that’s something that wasn’t going away anytime soon and I know how stressful that can be on a relationship. So I guess you have to ask yourself were you really better off dealing with that any longer?;2;2.0;[[0.96596131]];[[0.4499335]];0.9994;0.129;0.7829999999999999;0.087;-0.4363;0.13699999999999998;0.72;0.14300000000000002;0.04799999999999999;0.10256149079678488;0.1517857142857143;-0.049224223488929436
I (22F) with my ex(about to be 26,M): in need of advise on how to interpret the last few events of our spastic relationship so I can learn how to handle my anger better *SUPER LONG*;t3_8d7i81;2;"tl;dr:
Relationship with bipolar ex was a whirlwind 6 months in a transitory period of my life. He was sweet and very intelligent but tendencies that irritated me and eventually led to him crossing boundaries. I need advice on how I could have handled the situation better (as I have a tendency to be quick to anger) and if I was right to cut it off so “quick”. 

Body: 
Alright u/relationships, I’m here seeking your expertise and to be hit in the head with some truth. This sub tends to not have much tolerance for relationships lacking communication, its advice has nurtured my own skills and has motivated/directed my energy to putting work into this past relationship. I’m hoping I can learn and process the events that transpired yesterday with your guys’ collective advice. Onward to the... dilemma/event/story.

Background:
I met my ex, lets call him C, on tinder in July around my bday. whoop whoop. I initially wasn’t taken with him and actually had a small fling with someone else before meeting up with him 3 months later. C kept my interest by talking business and recommending books for me to read that I really enjoyed. 

Once the fling fizzled out, I decided to meet with him in person around October. We met twice before becoming taken with one another and shortly after got into a relationship. The second date, (now around November) C accompanied me to find a room to rent and ended up engaging the leaser and getting me the place. I saw for the first time his energy and was attracted to how he at ease he was at talking (hahahaha this becomes a problem later, read on!). The conversation lasted three hours and touched on a plethora of subjects; it was sublime. 

When we left, C asked if I would like to head to his place to continue talking and after my objection of not wanting to have sex so quick, emphasized wanting to get to know me. I agreed and from there the relationship took off.  I helped C move into a new place 2/3 days later and stayed with him for a full week before moving out to my place. Moving out of my parents to my own place is a whole other story of its own (skip next paragraph if you dont want the details).

But short version: abusive parents kicked me out of the house late November, went through my things and recorded me as I picked up my stuff for “legal purposes”. I contained my anger, but at one point I had to run out to C to calm myself. He said that the fact I could stop myself so quickly when I recognized the consequences of my anger  was a sign that we could make this relationship work. 

I met his friends really quickly and grew to love them and form my own friendships with them... which of course I no longer have. His two roommates were his best friend from college and the friend’s cousin, the three were part of a larger, tight friend group that frequently spent time together. In January, I had to temporarily stay at his place and made sure I was the best guest there was. I paid half C’s share of rent and contributed to household supplies. My OCD also made sure the place was spotless and that the boys were all fed. It was a fun time for sure. 

Things started spiraling last month in March. I got a new job that required me to work 10 hour days. My commute is an hour and a half (by public transportation) so that means I have no time to really do anything else. Conveniently, C lives 5 mins from my work, and I live 15 mins from his work. I would hop over to his place and spend the night with him to make my commute easier, or vice versa we would stay at my place so it would be easier for him to get to work.

";1;"You were with a guy who has *no business* being in a relationship.

Check out #2 and #6 -- almost identical. You cuddle with him in bed, he can't control his impulses, starts kissing you, and literally says ""I can't help it"" as his excuse. 

Remember when you spent 3 hours the first time telling him why it wasn't okay? Didn't do any good, did it?

If you were wrong for anything, it's assuming that this was an issue you could fix through ""patience"" and explanations. He lacks the tool set to deal with his emotions, and probably using weed as a crutch to help cope. 

He needs help. Like *help* help, a professional. It's above your pay grade. ";2;2.0;[[0.93936789]];[[0.52765111]];0.9994;0.129;0.7829999999999999;0.087;-0.8158;0.057999999999999996;0.802;0.14;0.12400000000000005;0.10256149079678488;0.11249999999999998;-0.00993850920321511

I would just say trust your guts. If you have/feel chemistry with each other and she doesn't hold back sexually refusing you oral and all the fun stuff (which you know she did with them) then you are just overthinking a bit.

&gt;I wonder if she dated people based on looks until she’d had her fun and she is just with me because I’ll be reliable to settle down with.

The answer is YES. Sounds like one of those chicks who date and get knocked up by the bad boy/biker/loser and then when they're used up, resentful, and suspicious they look to guys like you - Poindexter to make her feel safe and take care of her after she's ""Had her fun"". I like to take those types of women and ask them the following question ""Why should I get to be the first guy who DOESN'T get to have fun with you?"" Screw that. Wait a few years till they're divorced and in their early 40s - you'll be the king.

Found out my girlfriend was being sexually harassed in one of her classes, not sure what to do now.;t3_8dart4;6;"Hey, throwaway here.
So, my girlfriend and I have been dating for a few months now and after casually talking about school today, she brings up that her first period is super boring shes gonna be doing a bunch of homework during that class because, it's basically a study hall. She then mentions that a classmate touches her ass and boobs in that class and the whole [conversation is here](https://imgur.com/a/gJclPYg)

She has acknowledged that my reaction was normal for the circumstances and apologized, but I'm not sure what to think or do now. She chooses to not stand up for herself, I know she's very loyal. I'm not really questioning if she's cheating I know she's not, that guy is just a weirdo in the class.

any thoughts or advice for me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
";3;"I'm sorry, but if some random boy was grabbing *my* boobs and ass, he'd get sent to the hospital. She needs to stand up for herself and not let creeps do shit like that to her, boyfriend or not. What if he goes further? What if she's assaulted? Would she still not ""care""? That's unhealthy thinking, to let people take advantage and not act.

She talked about her mom making drama. Is that a big issue for her? Perhaps she would benefit from talking to her family about it, because letting this careless attitude slip into other relationships only makes things worse.

I had doubts because I'm very family oriented and my family doesn't have the money to come visit from new york and they're not the most healthy people. I worry about them being alone.

He took that as, I didnt want to go.

He didnt talk to me for 3 days. When he came back around, he said ""listen, I've decided. I want you to come with me but I'm going with or without you. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and you're not supporting me."" I asked if we would break up if I didn't go, he said we could do long distance but it probably wouldn't work out.

I feel like if you truly love someone, you would never leave them like that. I feel betrayed. I would never leave him like that, no matter what was offered to me. I feel like if he didn't come with it would be a miserable experience anyway.

Am I crazy? Am I being selfish or is he being selfish? My head is spinning. ";1;"Yes. 

You are engaged to someone who is making a choice to keep a stable job and further his career whether or not you support him. He didn’t say he wasn’t gonna marry you.

Clearly he values his career, as he re-enlisted. When the military tells you to go, you go. And if you don’t, there can be serious consequences career wise. At least he got a choice, some people don’t. 

But just to get some perspective, ask him to explain to you what happens if he denies orders. ";1;1.0;[[0.95333318]];[[0.57418016]];-0.8607;0.124;0.73;0.146;0.8671;0.162;0.774;0.064;-0.12;0.002922077922077929;0.011111111111111108;-0.00818903318903318

That being said you should both support each other but it seems like he was pretty quick (just a few days) to make peace with leaving you. He might just have a more independent personality, i dont know him. Or the other explanation is that he is REALLY passionate about living abroad /Hawaii. There are always options. When my bf talked about leaving where we live we talked about what we would do if we want to come back, Bec of family. If you’re about to get married i would think he would be trying to work out other scenarios and not just say well then if you don’t want to go, bye. I couldn’t leave my boyfriend no matter how badly i would want to, if he refused to come with me, he’s my life partner. But it doesn’t even sound like you flat out refused, more like hesitated.

You're being hypocritical here: you're basically considering ""leaving"" him because your parents can't visit you.

How early do you fall asleep? Because that’s a factor.

Here are some ideas but I’m sure you tried most of them

- Coffee that night AND the morning after.
- Change sleeping schedule.
- Talk about changing HER sleeping schedule.
- Tea also has caffeine in it.
- Try to be active in the evening (physically). It’ll train your body to be more awake at that time.
- Try cold/hot showers. (Whatever wakes you up more.)

Those are things just off the top of my head. But, like I said, it’s kind of weird she’s making it such a big deal.

She is wrong. This isn't how bodies work.

By all means, if you have concerns about how easily you fall asleep, consult a physician; you may have some form of narcolepsy, for instance, or some other issue.

But she's demanding that your relationship to her should dictate how your body operates. That's a bit like saying she shouldn't have a period when you two have sex. This isn't a planned thing; bodies don't work that way.

Instead, ask her what might help her pass the time when she's awake and you aren't. For example, maybe you could write her some letters which she can open and read when you are asleep. If you are feeling particularly creative, you can [write them in code](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/), which will help her occupy her time.

A little yellow caution flag, though: She might have unrealistic expectations, or a belief that she can manipulate things to her advantage. One way to consider if something is fair is it she would agree to it if the tables were turned; that's why I mentioned her stopping her own period. Be careful. Talk with her about what seems realistic, and how it doesn't seem fair when you think of it in the other direction.

Ex-Boyfriend Left Me Twice. Help!;t3_8d2w5q;3;"My Ex\-Boyfriend Left Me Twice

Hi everyone,

I thought I'd share my story to try and get some opinions/advice on a breakup I'm dealing with right now. It's been pretty tough, especially since the same guy has dumped me twice.

I dated this guy \(25 years old\) I was head over heels for about four months a while back. I \(19 years old\) basically self\-sabotaged and did a pretty stupid thing and I broke this guy's trust. I did not cheat or do anything extreme, but I did lie to him pretty badly and I was caught. He ended up staying with me after all and we ended up dating a couple months following, then he broke up with me in October. He said he wasn't into me anymore and he did not love me and just needed time to himself, etc. He listed a ton of excuses. But, following a couple of weeks after the breakup, I found out that he was dating his ex already. That sucked. But, I moved on.

I ended up getting over this guy and I moved on with my life. I was single and happy for around 3 1/2 months and then I got a random message from him. He was basically apologizing for the way he had handled the break up. He said he felt guilty of how harsh he was and that he should have met with me in person rather than over text. Anyways, I was indifferent by then and said it was fine. We started hanging out and things were really rocky at first. I had a lot of anger towards him and he had resentment towards me. But eventually we started dating after about a month of seeing each other. It was good. I was actually happy with this guy and yes, we had our little arguments but other than that I was genuinely happy...and he seemed like he was too.

Well, he broke up with me again randomly \(did I mention the first time he dumped me, it was totally random?\). This time he said that he ""just wasn't happy in the relationship and wasn't happy with me"". He said that he couldn't feel comfortable with me and he's tried over and over with me to feel happy, but he just isn't in it. Which sucks for me, because just a few days earlier we'd had the best day possible together and he told me how happy he was over and over again. I met with him this morning and it went awfully. I ended up losing my cool and yelling and saying hurtful things and now I feel awful because I hate ending things on a bad note. But he told me that he ""missed me when we were broken up and thought he wanted to be with me again but now he doesn't"". I sincerely tried everything for this guy. I would cook him dinners and make sure he was happy and would always be there for him no matter what.

He said he still loves me and cares so much about me, but just doesn't think we are good for each other. He also is very insecure about himself and is not happy with how he looks, his job, himself. He mentioned he didn't want a relationship with me and honestly needed to work on himself. Does anyone have any tips on how to move on? What this situation sounds like? Do guys leave even though they still love each other? And do you think that this is something he would eventually regret? He told me that after he broke up with me the first time, he had to get counseling because he felt so guilty/bad about what he'd done. Help!";1;"Brutal truth? You had an event that broke you up. You recovered rather quickly (in the scheme of things). I'm sure you saw each other differently and probably less idealistically. 

He thought you were a solid relationship to either fall back on or try again for real. 

I'll bet even money that this time he saw something that didn't work. It doesn't have to be your fault or his. I'm saying that after a bad breakup, some rocky re-getting to know each other and a little more dating, maybe he made a decision. 

I'm trying to conjure up an explanation for his behavior. If I am wrong, he has some 'splaining to do. I wouldn't hang too much on that, however. My bet is that this time it is for good.

I'm [28/m] feeling like I was coerced into marriage by [27/f] and don't know how I can express my needs without being coercive myself;t3_8d34me;2;"TL/DR:

  - How is it possible to have fully consensual sex in a caring relationship?
  - Is it possible that I was coerced into marriage?


---

I've been reading about consent and ""yes means no"" cases, and it seems to feel relevant to what I've intuitively felt.

For those not familiar, ""yes means no"" movement is telling that even if woman said ""yes"",
it doesn't necessarily mean that she consented to sex, since it may be that she was coerced into saying ""yes""
(by threatening, guilt-inducing, or other reasons).

Having low self-esteem, and being profoundly bad at empathy, I've always disbelieved when someone wants to have a conversation or spend time with me,
because I've always thought that they are doing it out of politeness or because they want to improve work relationships rather than because they
are interested in me (so their offer for conversation is not fully consensual).

So naturally, when I thought about having sex, I've always wanted to find someone who would truly want to do it with me.
Where yes actually means yes, and woman isn't agreeing due to some other factors (i.e. to stabilize the relationship).

However after meeting someone and getting into a relationship where we cared about each other,
I realized that it is impossible to have consensual sex in a relationship.

---

Let me show how I came to this idea and you can say where I was wrong. First let's list some facts:

1. I care about her
2. She cares about me
3. We are in a monogamous relationship (marriage even)
4. I have a lot of things I wanted to try in sex life
5. She doesn't care much about sex but enjoys relationship, wants it to last, wants to have children and big family

So to start with, since I care about her, I want to give her what she wants: lifetime relationship and commitment, even if it is hard for me.
Maybe at that point I should have thought about what I actually want, but I felt responsibility.

Then whenever I think about initiating sex with her, I start analyzing: what if she says ""no""? That would be hurtful. Maybe I shouldn't ask.

Then I take a step further, assuming that she knows it is important or me,
let's try to imagine what she might think about me:
*""Oh he wants sex. I know he never had anyone before me and he sacrificed his other opportunities in order to give me what I want.
If I reject him now, he'll know that he can't go anywhere else since I've asked him to be monogamous, so he'll feel sad and hopeless.
I care about him, so I should say 'yes'.""*.

So it seems that if she is caring (and she is), she'll have to say ""yes"", so it becomes a coercion and not a consent.
Hence I can't ever show my interest or have any initiative.

To generalize, I can't see how ever in caring monogamous relationship sex can be consensual.

The only pure consensual case to me seems to be when people:

 - Know that they won't see each other in the future, so there are no consequences to saying ""no""
 - Know that neither side is needy, so there is no moral obligation to say ""yes""
 
---

Stretching it further, is it fair to say that not only sex, but relationship, marriage and monogamy can be non-consensual?

I.e. if:

 - I didn't want to be in long-term relationship at that time (didn't feel ready)
 - Then I said it isn't going to work, and she cried and I felt sorry for her feelings (and also that my life is better than hers)
 - Then I proposed to her - because this is what she wanted and what society expected me to
 - At the end I'm regretting the whole thing and am feeling miserable

It seems it triggers several of flags of coercion, e.g.:

 - Person didn't want it at the beginning
 - Then they did it out of feelings of obligation or guilt (rather than giving enthusiastic consent)
 - Then they regretted doing it
 
Does it mean that my marriage was non-consensual and I was coerced into it?

If later on she wants children, and I do it because I ""owe"" it to her,
and because I can't end the relationship out of fear of being alone,
would it mean that I was coerced into having children under guilt and the threat of relationship ending?";1;Are you seeing a therapist?

&gt;She doesn't care much about sex but enjoys relationship, wants it to last, wants to have children and big family

Is this how she feels? Do you know this for a fact? Because if not, there's always an alternative: ""She enjoys sex with you and wants to have it with you."" That is a thing that can in fact happen. And, if she says Yes, you don't have to doubt it. She is ultimately responsible for making decisions about herself, and that includes consenting to sexual relations \-\- even within the context of a loving relationship.

And yes, sometimes a wife will choose to have sex with her husband even if she doesn't want to. Sometimes she will engage in these activities to please him, even though she has no real interest \(at least at that moment\) in it herself. You can look at this as coercion... or you can look at it as making a sacrifice in the name of love. Only the woman, herself, can tell you what motivated her.

As to the idea that you were coerced into marriage... Well, unfortunately, that too can happen. And it sounds like it has. If that's the case, you need to spend some time with a therapist, working on your self\-esteem and your ability to assert yourself. *You proposed when you didn't want to*. For good or ill, the buck stops there. You may have felt pressured, you may have felt obligated, but you could have stuck to your guns \-\- and if you had, well, you'd scarcely be the first man who skipped out on his responsibilities.

\(I'd say that you need to talk to your wife about this, but I think you need to talk to your therapist *first*. There's a lot going on here. It's clear you feel very, very trapped, and you need to be able to confront that in a calm and productive manner, which \-\- no offense \-\- I doubt you can do at this time.\)";3;3.0;[[0.96475707]];[[0.7307192]];0.6859;0.11199999999999999;0.79;0.098;0.9913;0.179;0.731;0.09;-0.075;-0.01802054154995332;0.16243589743589745;-0.18045643898585076

My [21F] ex [21M] keeps texting me and it’s annoying my current boyfriend [22M].;t3_8cq2pn;7;"Hi everyone!

For some background, D and I were friends that ended up dating August - November 2016 and I haven’t seen him since. We parted on okay terms, and stayed in very occasional contact.

My current boyfriend, A, and I have been together almost 8 months now. He has been very jealous, but has worked on it for this relationship. 

About a month into A and I’s relationship, we broke up for two weeks. I ended up texting D during that time period, and vented to him. It ended up getting flirty, but nothing ever came of it, and A and I got back together.

Around December, he texted me about a mutual friend’s party, and when I told him I was bringing A, he said “make sure he doesn’t step out of line, or I’ll snatch you back up.”

He says it was a joke, but I deleted him off of social media and made it clear that was inappropriate. 

D is a writer, and when we were together he would let me read and edit what he wrote. Earlier this month, he sent me some things he had written, and I edited them for him. He ended up continuing to try and text me for the next few days, although it never crossed a line.

You stop.

Im glad you are a writer who likes critiquing and helping other writers.  If only there was a system of computers that made like a network where writers all over the world could meet and do that very thing.  I would call it the internet, and it would be glorious.

Then I would use that ""Internet"" to find people who aren't people I used to bang, and do the thing I love doing with people who also love doing it all while not keeping my ex around.

You can also join 1 of probably hundreds of writing groups in your local area if you are in a city.

That will of course only work if this is actually about you liking critiquing writing, and not about you liking to talk to your ex despite it being someting most S.O's are not comfortable with.

";1;"do you have a group of friends to go to prom with? even just one friend? that’s what got me through prom. 

also, i know it doesn’t seem like it, but lots of people go through what feels like a majority of their lives without having been in a relationship/been kissed/held hands/ had sex. i’m in college, and i’ve never had any of that. (well, kind of held hands but it was contextually not romantic, and my first kiss was a good friend who asked if i wanted to kiss her because i was complaining about never having kissed anyone. i don’t count it as a real kiss because we weren’t seeing each other romantically, just platonically). 

anyways, lots of people go a really long time without having anything romantic with anyone. you’re not “less” than other girls. i felt very strongly how you feel when i was in high school, and i still do sometimes, but you just gotta keep your head up. a relationship will happen when the time is right. it’s not likely that a relationship will happen if you force it, at least not something you won’t regret. 

try practicing some self affirmations- “i am smart, i am kind, i am lovely, i am worthy of love, i deserve happiness,” etc. i’d also recommend treating yourself or pampering yourself- carve out some time to do what you enjoy! take a bubble bath! read a book! take a nap! go for a walk! whatever that means for you.

";1;"I'm an 18 guy who was in the same position as you this time last year. I was the friend who never got any ""action"". This was because I went to a school that only had 10 people in it (long story), so you're right about the small town thing being a factor. Meeting someone special is rare, but it's even rarer when you don't know many people.

I'm in university now and I have a girlfriend. I think it was worth the wait, she tells me stories of her high school boyfriends and sounds like high school boys are just super immature.

Just wait for it dude you'll make it through.

Oh and I went to prom alone too, I still had loads of fun, don't let that put you off :)

";1;"It's totally common to feel insecure about being single/not dating someone, and there's a really big culture through high school that you sort of have to date someone - especially when to comes to formals/prom. 

At the end of the day if there's someone you meet that you actually genuinely have an interest in then go for it. But the mentality of just wanting anyone in order to fill that role is ultimately going to be pretty unfulfilling.

There's going to be lots of people in your future that you will have an interest in - you meet so many people at university/college that its a no-brainer. Some might have had previous experience, so may not have, and really it won't matter. 

Personally one of the really big learning experiences I had from when I was 17 to now (24) was to separate the idea of what I felt I was 'supposed' to be doing, and what I actually wanted to do. In this case, I think there's a lot of anxiety and stress about having a boyfriend and/or having a first kiss/etc in a specific context more because it's the way in which you feel it's supposed to be or happen.

It's totally normal to have those anxieties and feel insecure about it. As silly as it may sound it can be a really great experience to just sit and reflect/think about why you feel insecure or what about it makes you feel insecure. 

If you wanna hook up/date the next random guy you meet then that's a totally okay choice to make. If you wanna wait to find someone else that's okay too. You're not going to know what an experience is like until you give it a shot, but make sure the motivation comes from what want to do - not what others say or make you feel you have to do.";1;1.0;[[0.96138876]];[[0.61781722]];0.8454;0.102;0.831;0.067;0.8390000000000001;0.071;0.8859999999999999;0.042;0.0059999999999999975;-0.10822474747474747;0.05477777777777778;-0.1630025252525253

For background: My partner and I both have advanced degrees and demanding careers. I am in no way shape or form EVER going to be a stay at home mother or a housewife, and I am unwilling to take on more than my share of household tasks for a home that we both share. He had a stay at home mom when he was growing up, and is an only child. I have siblings and my mom worked when I was growing up, so while I can't say she didn't help me, I was largely responsible for managing my own eating, laundry and calendar at a very young age. One way of doing things is not better than the other, but I think it has made me more aware and more critical of how much I am doing.

Herein lies the rub. I find that I am constantly reminding my partner to do the things that need done. We are fortunate enough to have a cleaning service come as needed for the floors and bathroom...ect. However there are still a lot of day to day things that need to get done. If he has ever gone to the grocery store without me asking him, it has been rare, and no plan was made for what we needed or what we would cook. I do the majority of the meal planning, laundry and general tidying around the house. He will sometimes wipe the bathroom down and we do about an equal amount of dishes, although I find often even when I cook I end up cleaning up as well. I also manage our shared calendar for the most part. Part of the problem is that he thinks that he is doing a lot of the household chores, but really he is doing very little, and he does almost no planning or organizing or management of our home. I think he just doesn't see how much more I do. 

So here are my questions. 1) Has anyone found a way to successfully share the emotional labor of running a home (the planning and thought that goes into running house. Things like managing a social calendar and noticing when we are low on things or when a task needs done)? 2.) Has anyone found a successful way to share the actual household labor?

Have the date the event should happen, and a magnet or marker for each of you and rotate it out. For example:

Bathroom (twice a week)  |    |you|

That way you each always end up doing the same chores, but alternating who does it, and get a nice, large-print calendar to put beside the chart and use large color-coded X's to mark the day the event should happen.

Yes, together sit down and list all of the chores and split them equally. Take the guessing out of who does what and when. If there's a disagreement on what's equal, discuss it and find a compromise you can both agree to. 

2. See above.

I disagree with this being a systematic issue. That's just minimizing yours - and his - role in this being so difficult for you. Your education or careers don't change that. If anything, it's pretentious that you feel the need to keep using that to justify both the problem and why you shouldn't have the problem. 

That being said, I've found that getting good shared apps and routines is important. My partner and I constantly are looking at ways to improve our tasks. We use Wunderlist to track tasks. We split the chores to what we think is even. We use google calendar to book our time. We take turns planning nights out or activities. 

My point is to take away all of the thought out of what needs to be done and when. Use whatever tools you can to make that easier.

Then it will pile up until he gets the picture. Just doing it for him anyway because it's easier shows him that his behavior works, and he will keep doing it. Put your foot down. 

What helps with me and my boyfriend is, we each have certain things we hate doing. For example, I hate vacuuming, my boyfriend hates doing the dishes. I'll offer to do the dishes if he vacuums. It's like an exchange that we both benefit from. We alternate sometimes too. We just do our best to make it fair, and it works. We just kinda, do it. We've never needed calendars or charts or whatever. Then again we are also both people who hate mess and clutter so that helps us get things done. There could be a conflict of interest there with you and your bf. Some people are perfectly content living in filth.

Any advice helps.";4;"He watched his mother work, and now he watches you work - no way he doesn't know the procedures, he's just disconnected himself from them, and prefers to be catered to. Learned helplessness isn't a chronic mental health disorder, it's a determination to maintain sexist boundaries.

Simple fix: Whatever it is he spends his time doing during those multiple hours every month you're managing the calendar, shopping and folding laundry? Get rid of that distraction. Seriously, begin with his agreement to end the gaming sessions or TV watching that he uses to distract himself from household needs. When you are working, he is working.

Sit down *together*, work out a checklist of daily, weekly and monthly household tasks and flowchart those suckers. Checking the pantry, planning meals -- those are weekly activities that you can walk him through *once* while he takes notes on the basics. Then he takes on those multi-step tasks like they are *HIS JOB* and becomes competent. He's an adult, he's learned on the job before, and he's capable. If he fails, its because HE WANTS TO FAIL, and the problem becomes how his determined helplessness is enforcing a sexist imbalance in your relationship and stealing your recharge time, right? 

Make a list of long-term tasks like planning vacations and dealing with insurance companies, and an honest estimate of the time you'll spend on hold, etc. 

The key here is time. You are entitled to as much down time as he gets, and right now he's taking that time away from you -- one of the reasons women visually age faster than men is that they don't have hours of relaxation to recharge. So make this about spending equal time dealing with the household, and equal time for quality recharging.

Keeping house isn't rocket science. You married an intelligent man. If he refuses to take on his share of the responsibilities, that's a decision he's made, and its up to you whether you accept being cast in the role of mother to your husband and the victim of an emotional work vampire.";4;1.0;[[0.97123078]];[[0.56624093]];0.973;0.111;0.8270000000000001;0.062;-0.3384;0.094;0.81;0.096;0.051;0.2159579772079772;0.04407936507936508;0.1718786121286121

I don't think education or career has anything to do with balancing housework. You are both in this relationship and in this household. You both have advanced degrees. Are you saying that he has an advanced degree but at the age of 29 doesn't know how to do laundry or buy groceries or meal plan? What if you got a year-long fellowship on the other side of the world? Would he wear dirty clothes to work or would he FIGURE IT OUT FOR HIMSELF? Does he just eat whatever you make, with no input? What happens if you have to stay late at work, go out last-minute with friends and aren't there to make dinner? Will he starve? Or will he figure it out for himself?

I also manage our shared calendar for the most part. Part of the problem is that he thinks that he is doing a lot of the household chores, but really he is doing very little, and he does almost no planning or organizing or management of our home.

What does it mean that you ""manage [the] social calendar"" for the both of you? Does he not have email, can he not plan activities or social events for himself or for the both of you? 

Here's something else, more tied to emotional labour than chores:

Am I [30F] being emotionally immature about how my partner [33M] opened up to me about his feelings? [X-post from relationships, because I really need advice];t3_8cwfah;45;"**The background:** I've been with my S/O for about a year and a half. Previous to me he had a girlfriend for ~1 year, that he lived with, and prior to that he was married for 4ish years.

We began dating in summer of 2016, where I knew he was casually seeing other people as well, and was okay because I had to go abroad for the winter. We kept in touch and he kept in pursuit of me, and I agreed to come back to the area when I was done and we would continue our relationship. He had almost a year, 6 months of which I wasn't even around for, to pursue other women and didn't even go on one other date while I was gone. I did not stop him. Honestly. I never once played the whole card of, ""if you start seeing someone I'll stop talking to you"" kind of card or whatever else while I was gone. I let him know I cared about him a great deal, and I was interested in making this a long-term thing. But it's important to note that he was the one actively pursuing me.

Now, I'm actually supposed to move in with him in about a month after he asked me for it many times, and we've had plans about it for the past 3ish?

**The conversation:** Things have been going pretty well for the last year and a half. Some bumps, mostly because of communication issues. However he's always told me how much he loves me. Until last week, where he said that he wasn't sure how he felt about me.

We had a big conversation about it last night, and it culminated in him saying he thinks he loves me. He gets confused between whether or not it's that he loves me or he just thinks I'm fun and wonderful and we have great sex. And that he's suffering from ""grass is greener"" syndrome, where he also sometimes thinks he wants to sleep around and date casually and be alone.

Essentially, he really wants to have the serious relationship with me, but also wants to live the ultimate bachelor life. I understand that I'm pretty much the only person he opens up to, and it's natural to have these conversations and it's natural to always wonder about the other side of things. I feel the same. 

**The issue:** I'm not sure if I can get past this one though, and I don't know if that's immature on my behalf. I know that men have a hard time expressing emotions and being put down for it, and the last thing I want to do is to be that person. 

The problem is, I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship (let alone move in with) with someone who I thought was fully in love with me. I fear it will feel like always having the Sword of Damocles hanging over our relationship, where he will just decide one day ""I'm out for greener pastures."" 

Is this immature of me? Should I bother trying to work past this? Please give me a reality check.

I don't have time to save up for first/last/security before the end of my lease at this point.";302;"He is allowed to be scared, uncertain, and avoidant. None of these feelings make him a bad person or a bad partner. He has trusted before that forever meant forever, and it hasn’t worked out as he hoped. Fear is fair; you report that he is clear eyed about it and is working to sort it out internally. 

You are allowed to draw a boundary where you don’t sacrifice your independence, your lease, your money, and your peace of mind to couple your life with ANYONE who isn’t all in. There is no maturity or immaturity in this, it’s just honoring yourself to say, ‘This is not going to happen on these terms.’ 

Both of those realities can coexist in a healthy relationship. If he’s not ready to move in together, just don’t. Keep dating, if you like him. Grow together. Work actively on expanding your communication skills together. Experience new things that will lead you both to greater security and certainty in your shared vision of a joint future. 

Don’t force a move-in. Doesn’t mean ditch him. Doesn’t mean yell and make ultimatums. Doesn’t mean shame him for telling you the truth as he experiences it. Doesn’t mean stop trusting him with your emotions. Doesn’t mean you’re dumb, or he’s dumb, or doom is on the horizon. Just slow it down, if the pace is scary to one or both of you. 

Best case scenario, in another year you’ll both have clarity and a stable, trustworthy connection that makes it easy for you both to make big changes. Worst case scenario, you still have your own home, you haven’t lost money in buying shared items that you have to replace, you’re not together, and you know that you have the relationship your most sincere effort.

Okay, first of all, a guy in his thirties who wants to move in with his girlfriend *should* be past any macho hang ups and capable of expressing his feelings by now.  Second, and more importantly, the whole point of him opening up is so you two can have a discussion about it.

Tell him you appreciate his honesty, but given the circumstance you don’t think moving in together is a wise decision at this time, because frankly it isn’t.

Why does it matter he was pursuing you so adamantly before?  Do you think that perhaps he just enjoys the chase?  Are you thinking he wants to “open up” your relationship and he is trying to prep you for that conversation?

Besides the financial side of things, what reason do you have to move in together?  Is it that you truly love him and see him as “the one” for you?  It sounds like you weren’t particularly invested until you were in the same location, and even then you only were because he was so doggedly pursuing you.  Maybe that isn’t the case, but that’s how it sounds.  Seems like kind of a push-pull relationship, if so.

Either way, moving in doesn’t seem like a smart move since you clearly harbor resentment at his commentary on being in a committed relationship, not that you shouldn’t, he’s being shitty.  Honest, but shitty.  Maybe he is afraid of moving in just yet.  He was fucking married, it isn’t as though he’s never met and dated another woman or had another relationship.  Maybe he is concerned about things going sour with you once finances are intertwined and is trying to find a less accusatory way of putting it.

Have another conversation with him and this time, be honest about what YOU are feeling.  You don’t have to be mean, but you do need to tell him his confession has given you pause, and go from there.

I can’t stress enough, though, moving in together when something like that is on the table is just the worst idea ever, do literally anything else.

Previous to me he had a girlfriend for ~1 year, that he lived with, and prior to that he was married for 4ish years.

We began dating in summer of 2016, where I knew he was casually seeing other people as well, and was okay because I had to go abroad for the winter. We kept in touch and he kept in pursuit of me, and I agreed to come back to the area when I was done and we would continue our relationship.

Now, I'm actually supposed to move in with him in about a month after he asked me for it many times, and we've had plans about it for the past 3ish?

**The conversation:** Things have been going pretty well for the last year and a half. Some bumps, mostly because of communication issues. However he's always told me how much he loves me. Until last week, where he said that he wasn't sure how he felt about me.

We had a big conversation about it last night, and it culminated in him saying he thinks he loves me. He gets confused between whether or not it's that he loves me or he just thinks I'm fun and wonderful and we have great sex. And that he's suffering from ""grass is greener"" syndrome, where he also sometimes thinks he wants to sleep around and date casually and be alone.

Essentially, he really wants to have the serious relationship with me, but also wants to live the ultimate bachelor life. I understand that I'm pretty much the only person he opens up to, and it's natural to have these conversations and it's natural to always wonder about the other side of things. I feel the same. 

**The issue:** I'm not sure if I can get past this one though, and I don't know if that's immature on my behalf. I know that men have a hard time expressing emotions and being put down for it, and the last thing I want to do is to be that person. 

The problem is, I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship (let alone move in with) with someone who I thought was fully in love with me.

I don't have time to save up for first/last/security before the end of my lease at this point.";302;"Just because he had one failed relationship and one failed marriage doesn't give him the right to have the emotional capacity of a pinhead. And I mean that in the nicest way possible. He's 33 years old. He should be able to sort out his feelings and his desires. He should also have some empathy for the situation he might possibly put you in because of how he's feeling. 

With that being said. Do NOT move in with him, under any circumstances. This conversation and his feelings are a giant elephant in the room that you guys will now try to avoid talking about and will eventually boil over if you move in together. Even if you do talk about it, tension will still boil over. My suggestion would be to either move in with family for the time being, or ask your roommate, if she's staying in the same apartment, if you can just sleep on the couch for the time being while helping with bills and such. Just do something other than move in with him.

My next suggestion would be, if you're both still really into trying this relationship, just go back to casually dating each other. Don't make it a relationship thing. Both of you play the field, and if you or one of you finds someone or decides you'd rather not date each other or someone else, than the relationship is over. Gives both of you the chance to see what else is out there while still dating each other. And go on real dates.

I personally would just end the relationship. While I might love someone dearly, I'm also not in the business of wasting my time while they figure out their feelings for me. Especially if we've already been with each for over a year. By then someone should know how they feel without serious concern. I personally do not like being strung along which is what he is doing to you.

Look, honesty is great but there was no benefit to this. If he’s going to drop these bombs he should have been more prepared to make some action. 

Basically he’s telling you that he is now unsure and looking around for a possible out (but also, maybe not!!) and yet he sat on this til it was so late in your plans, it’s going to hurt you financially to back out.

He had almost a year, 6 months of which I wasn't even around for, to pursue other women and didn't even go on one other date while I was gone. I did not stop him. Honestly. I never once played the whole card of, ""if you start seeing someone I'll stop talking to you"" kind of card or whatever else while I was gone. I let him know I cared about him a great deal, and I was interested in making this a long-term thing. But it's important to note that he was the one actively pursuing me.

Now, I'm actually supposed to move in with him in about a month after he asked me for it many times, and we've had plans about it for the past 3ish?

**The conversation:** Things have been going pretty well for the last year and a half. Some bumps, mostly because of communication issues. However he's always told me how much he loves me. Until last week, where he said that he wasn't sure how he felt about me.

We had a big conversation about it last night, and it culminated in him saying he thinks he loves me. He gets confused between whether or not it's that he loves me or he just thinks I'm fun and wonderful and we have great sex. And that he's suffering from ""grass is greener"" syndrome, where he also sometimes thinks he wants to sleep around and date casually and be alone.

Essentially, he really wants to have the serious relationship with me, but also wants to live the ultimate bachelor life. I understand that I'm pretty much the only person he opens up to, and it's natural to have these conversations and it's natural to always wonder about the other side of things. I feel the same. 

**The issue:** I'm not sure if I can get past this one though, and I don't know if that's immature on my behalf. I know that men have a hard time expressing emotions and being put down for it, and the last thing I want to do is to be that person. 

The problem is, I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship (let alone move in with) with someone who I thought was fully in love with me. I fear it will feel like always having the Sword of Damocles hanging over our relationship, where he will just decide one day ""I'm out for greener pastures."" 

Is this immature of me? Should I bother trying to work past this? Please give me a reality check.

My SO and I were in a 1.5 year relationship and I moved abroad for 6 months, although we both decided to stay committed and do the long-distance thing.  

A few months after I returned, he bought a house. He never really ""invited"" me to move in, but I was fine with that because I'm still in school/live with my mom so can't really afford it.  

Once this happened he started acting more selfish. When I called him out on it, he said the same things your SO is saying. We decided to both put more effort into the relationship.  

About 6 weeks later he drunkenly cheats on me and tells me the next day, essentially saying he took the coward way out. If your SO is feeling this way I'd say it's a red flag. Unless he's willing to be introspective and really figure out why he feels like this, then I don't think it'll work. Also my opinion is very bias.

He’s emotionally mature enough to be open and honest about his feelings, but apparently not enough to settle down with one person. 

Had he never expressed these feelings and you had moved in together then a few months down the road he decided that the grass was indeed greener on the other side, what would be your first thought? Would it be, “God... I just wish he would’ve talked to me about this before we moved in together!” And if so, why would that be it? Probably so you could’ve made a different choice. 

Also if you move in now, with the information that you have, you could be setting a precedent for the level of commitment he feels he has to give. If you don’t move in now and explain why, he may be motivated to be more dedicated. 

Neither of you did anything wrong necessarily. Neither of you is being immature. Keep the lines of communication open with him and yourself and see what happens.

Other people have made excellent points, but no one has mentioned this. There is absolutely 0 way you can really know that the above is true. It's very possible he has been sleeping and dating around while you were abroad/not living with him and now the fact you were moving in made him panic sends up red flags to me.

Get out, find any other place you can live. Thank him for being honest, tell him you are at a point in your life you are looking for true commitment. He has been married once before already and is only 33?

He sounds like someone who has always had trouble committing. When you were abroad and not living with him, commitment - or the appearance of it - is easy. Now that you were going to move in, it is a real change in his life and how he lives it.

When people tell you who they are, believe them. In this case, even if he actually has been faithful but having doubts, he has told you he is unsure.

In the matters of love, unsure is the cruelest way to say ""no, I'm not in love with you"" because it gives the other person a false sense of hope.

If he was in love with you, he would know it and there would not be this level of doubt so early on in the stages of the relationship.

Save yourself any more time and any more heartache and run while you can, before you're entangled any more financially or emotionally.

I'm so sorry he pulled this stunt last minute, putting you in a bind. He had multiple times he could have said something while planning, this is a dick move.

He is the immature one because he is so selfish he cannot empathize with others and the pain he causes them. I have a feeling this was a pattern in his prior relationships failing.

If you moved in with him, and tried to work out the differences and reassure him anyway...here's what would happen: he would begin to resent you. The time you are in the house/apartment/whatever with him and he cannot be alone, or the fact he cannot just impulsively do whatever he wants as a bachelor. You would also not trust him, because he has said this to you and cast doubt. Your resentment would grow as he stayed out late or if he seemed to be secretive about anything (even harmless things like a Christmas present, you would always wonder if it was something more...).

It's not you, it's him.

Not sure why he would ask you to move in with him if he’s unsure about his feelings for you and on top of that wanting to explore other women. He had that chance when you went abroad. Great that he’s communicating his feelings, but unfair that he’s put you in a position where it sounds like you need to depend on him for a place to stay. 

I’d say not to move in with him and figure out what’s going to be your living situation. It’s either go back home, or find a roommate who’s renting a room. If your only option is to move in with him then make it clear it’s only for a few months to have up and get your own place. Be clear that you want him to feel free to explore what he needs.

**The issue:** I'm not sure if I can get past this one though, and I don't know if that's immature on my behalf. I know that men have a hard time expressing emotions and being put down for it, and the last thing I want to do is to be that person. 

The problem is, I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship (let alone move in with) with someone who I thought was fully in love with me.

- No it is not immature at all.
- He is not ready for a committed relationship.
- I know that for the time being he want a FWB type of relationship, and I think that in many way's that could work both ways. At least until you find the right guy! 
- About being a financial pickle. Can you share an apartment with someone? (Friend, family, etc) Don't be embarrassed. Can you ask family to help you?

Good luck.

I'd just ask yourself if he does this now, will he do it again later, especially since you've been so understanding about his sex life choices in the past and might not see it as a big deal.

He gets confused between whether or not it's that he loves me or he just thinks I'm fun and wonderful and we have great sex. And that he's suffering from ""grass is greener"" syndrome, where he also sometimes thinks he wants to sleep around and date casually and be alone.

Essentially, he really wants to have the serious relationship with me, but also wants to live the ultimate bachelor life. I understand that I'm pretty much the only person he opens up to, and it's natural to have these conversations and it's natural to always wonder about the other side of things. I feel the same. 

**The issue:** I'm not sure if I can get past this one though, and I don't know if that's immature on my behalf. I know that men have a hard time expressing emotions and being put down for it, and the last thing I want to do is to be that person. 

The problem is, I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship (let alone move in with) with someone who I thought was fully in love with me. I fear it will feel like always having the Sword of Damocles hanging over our relationship, where he will just decide one day ""I'm out for greener pastures."" 

Is this immature of me? Should I bother trying to work past this? Please give me a reality check.

It always happens right before making a big commitment to someone, I say try talking to him about that insecurity. Sometimes that commitment comes with the feeling of being trapped, try to assure him that you're not trying to make him feel trapped and he's free to leave if that's how he feels. 

IMO love is supposed to make you feel empowered because you have someone to rely on, but if it feels limiting it can turn toxic real quick. Make sure to express your own feelings as well, because if it's just a temporary insecurity of his then he'll need to assuage your own insecurity that resulted from it.

I can see it from your point of view totally - ""why would I move in with someone who is expressing doubt at the last possible minute?"" It's one thing to not know if your partner ""loves"" you, but what I'm getting at is that you guys aren't even to that point. He can't delineate if *he* loves you. 

To me that's a major red flag. That tells me he's still learning about himself and what he wants out of life. Which is perfectly fine, but not on the precipice of moving in together. He's leaning more toward wanting to see other people rather than being ""scared."" A grown man who is confident and comfortable with himself should not be scared to move in with a woman he cares about.   

What this tells me is that it is planned. Maybe not consciously by him, but perhaps subconsciously due to the looming deadline of moving in together. He is subverting the process. Like as if he knows that's the end as a ""bachelor."" - Your words not mine.  

It's ok to be scared, but like you I would need to know where an individual stands in their head-space before moving in with them to be sure.

We began dating in summer of 2016, where I knew he was casually seeing other people as well, and was okay because I had to go abroad for the winter. We kept in touch and he kept in pursuit of me, and I agreed to come back to the area when I was done and we would continue our relationship. He had almost a year, 6 months of which I wasn't even around for, to pursue other women and didn't even go on one other date while I was gone. I did not stop him. Honestly. I never once played the whole card of, ""if you start seeing someone I'll stop talking to you"" kind of card or whatever else while I was gone.

Essentially, he really wants to have the serious relationship with me, but also wants to live the ultimate bachelor life. I understand that I'm pretty much the only person he opens up to, and it's natural to have these conversations and it's natural to always wonder about the other side of things. I feel the same. 

**The issue:** I'm not sure if I can get past this one though, and I don't know if that's immature on my behalf. I know that men have a hard time expressing emotions and being put down for it, and the last thing I want to do is to be that person. 

The problem is, I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship (let alone move in with) with someone who I thought was fully in love with me. I fear it will feel like always having the Sword of Damocles hanging over our relationship, where he will just decide one day ""I'm out for greener pastures.""

you are completely justified in how you feel. Anyone would find that to be troubling or even downright insulting. 

However, I think you should give this person a chance. He has opened up to you about a serious problem and confined in you, and you are the ""grass"" he chose, regardless. The fact that he has these thoughts and is still in a healthy relationship with you is a great sign. 

As for solutions, Consider looking into polyamory or open relationships. They are serious relationships which often end or begin with marriage \(since you mentioned that was important\). You could stay together while also exploring other dating options. Even if the open relationship is not what you want, you still could get a sense of his feelings from how he reacts to it or the suggestion. If you were each allowed to date openly with your consent, he might realize that you're his love and he was simply having normal self doubts. Or he might realize he just wants to be a bachelor.

**most importantly:** trust your gut. If the partner just feels wrong and incompatible, its a serious bad sign. Do you picture yourself telling stories to your kids about this person in 10 years? Does being around him make you feel good about yourself? Does he make you happy? Is he the person you want to be with?";1;0.003311258278145696;[[0.97884052]];[[0.58167796]];0.9761;0.115;0.818;0.067;0.8723;0.11800000000000001;0.7859999999999999;0.096;0.02600000000000001;0.04644491792929293;0.07738095238095237;-0.03093603445165945

When I met my current bf, he wanted something serious. He has a 4 to boy so he doesn't want to sleep around. He wants someone stable around his son.


But we didn't start as loving each others already and all.

We spent a lot of time together, I was almost every day at his place.

I also have a great relationship with his son.


We were to move together, because I had to find a new place, but we weren't bf and gf.

I told him I wasn't comfortable in that status. He wasn't comfortable being more because he was hurt.

I told him I can understand his position but that I wouldn't wait months to be officials.

It took a week, we spoke about it again. I stopped answering immediately, because I was sad. I didn't want to answer bad things, and I was too hurt that after taking care so much of his son I was still the girl he was dating.

In the hours I didn't answer, he has a conversation alone and decided he preferred being official but not losing me.


We said the I love you a few weeks later


So it will be almost a year, we're moving in together in a bigger apartment, adopted a dog and bought a car.

We even speak of having a kid within a few years.


And I'm right now taking care of his son because he works at night.

Previous to me he had a girlfriend for ~1 year, that he lived with, and prior to that he was married for 4ish years.

We began dating in summer of 2016, where I knew he was casually seeing other people as well, and was okay because I had to go abroad for the winter. We kept in touch and he kept in pursuit of me, and I agreed to come back to the area when I was done and we would continue our relationship. He had almost a year, 6 months of which I wasn't even around for, to pursue other women and didn't even go on one other date while I was gone. I did not stop him. Honestly. I never once played the whole card of, ""if you start seeing someone I'll stop talking to you"" kind of card or whatever else while I was gone. I let him know I cared about him a great deal, and I was interested in making this a long-term thing. But it's important to note that he was the one actively pursuing me.

Now, I'm actually supposed to move in with him in about a month after he asked me for it many times, and we've had plans about it for the past 3ish?

**The conversation:** Things have been going pretty well for the last year and a half. Some bumps, mostly because of communication issues. However he's always told me how much he loves me. Until last week, where he said that he wasn't sure how he felt about me.

We had a big conversation about it last night, and it culminated in him saying he thinks he loves me. He gets confused between whether or not it's that he loves me or he just thinks I'm fun and wonderful and we have great sex. And that he's suffering from ""grass is greener"" syndrome, where he also sometimes thinks he wants to sleep around and date casually and be alone.

Essentially, he really wants to have the serious relationship with me, but also wants to live the ultimate bachelor life. I understand that I'm pretty much the only person he opens up to, and it's natural to have these conversations and it's natural to always wonder about the other side of things. I feel the same. 

**The issue:** I'm not sure if I can get past this one though, and I don't know if that's immature on my behalf. I know that men have a hard time expressing emotions and being put down for it, and the last thing I want to do is to be that person. 

The problem is, I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship (let alone move in with) with someone who I thought was fully in love with me. I fear it will feel like always having the Sword of Damocles hanging over our relationship, where he will just decide one day ""I'm out for greener pastures."" 

Is this immature of me? Should I bother trying to work past this? Please give me a reality check.

**tl/dr: significant other of 1.5 years suffers from ""grass is greener"" syndrome, and I'm not sure if I'm emotionally immature for seeing it as a red flag and wanting to step out of a relationship where I thought we were working toward serious things.**

Your ability to communicate with one another even when it puts you in a place of vulnerability is pretty huge. Yes, his timing is not ideal, but it's a hell of a lot better than him telling you this after you've already moved in and developed a comfortable routine together. At least now you can approach this new living situation with prudence. If you both continue to be clear about your feelings, I don't think you need to fear living together. Try it out for awhile and in the meantime start saving some money so that if you decide it's not going to work out you can move out in a couple of months. If he was patient enough to wait for you while you were living abroad than hopefully he can be patient enough not to act on his grass is greener impulses while you are living together and figuring things out. ;0;0.0;[[0.98049231]];[[0.37940561]];0.9761;0.115;0.818;0.067;0.818;0.13699999999999998;0.785;0.078;-0.01100000000000001;0.04644491792929293;0.12818181818181826;-0.08173690025252531

I was previously married for nearly 4 years, in the relationship for 7.

It took a number of years (with a one years stint with someone during that time) to get back to a place where I was truly ready for a LTR and not just eager not to be single any longer.

I am almost solely responsible for paying for groceries, gas for the car, utility bills, etc. sometimes she doesnt have enough for even her rent so i end up covering some, if not all of that too. she works one part time job 3-4 days a week, basically on call some weeks. She does not have a license or a car and does not wish to take any form of public transportation alone. So its up to me to get her to and from work.

Furthermore, she turns around and gets upset with me if i bring any of these points up. she doesnt try to get her drivers license so she can help with driving (and help take care of her dog, which is also something i do almost exclusively) Lastly, because of all this extra stress and bills and whatnot, tensions have been higher than usual, and while i will say truthfully she is the one who treats me unfairly, i would be a liar if i said ive never responded angrily or rudely towards her like she does to me, but I think its not fair that she treats me the way she does while im the one whos putting in the extra work for the sake of both of us. am i wrong for thinking this way?

Additionally, there was a recent water damage incident in our home that we are responsible for paying for. long story short she left something on and flooded the house. ive covered the first payment toward the bill, and havent heard anything from her along the lines of ""how can i help?"" she doesnt try to find another job/more money so she can help with the finances. Furthermore, she turns around and gets upset with me if i bring any of these points up. she doesnt try to get her drivers license so she can help with driving (and help take care of her dog, which is also something i do almost exclusively) Lastly, because of all this extra stress and bills and whatnot, tensions have been higher than usual, and while i will say truthfully she is the one who treats me unfairly, i would be a liar if i said ive never responded angrily or rudely towards her like she does to me, but I think its not fair that she treats me the way she does while im the one whos putting in the extra work for the sake of both of us. am i wrong for thinking this way? 

TL;DR

I work 50 hours a week so my partner and i can live comfortably but she doesnt work enough to cover any other bills/expenses besides rent sometimes, doesnt make an effort like i am to help with these financial responsibilities and responds incredibly negatively when i try to urge her to get up and help out. Am i wrong in feeling upset and about our relationship? How do i confront her about helping me?

Nope. 

&gt;She does not have a license or a car and does not wish to take any form of public transportation alone. So its up to me to get her to and from work. 

So if you went away for the weekend or were in the hospital or any other thing happened, she'd figure out a way to get to work, right? She needs to do that now - what you're talking about is not sustainable.

THIS WHOLE ARRANGEMENT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.  ";1;1.0;[[0.95618934]];[[0.67724547]];0.8949;0.115;0.785;0.1;-0.3041;0.017;0.946;0.036000000000000004;0.034;0.010747004933051451;0.09345238095238097;-0.08270537601932951
[25/M] Feeling underappreciated by my [22/F] partner. Am i allowed to be upset?;t3_8d6z64;4;"My partner [22/F] and I [25/M] have been together for over two years and have been living together for about a year and a half now. we met at a small part time kitchen job were we were both working. At first it was great obviously with the honeymoon phase and all, and 8 months in we both were in need of a place to live so we moved in together. Lately, however, it hasnt been as fun. We live in an expensive area but our family and friends are here so I dont want to leave. Because of this, ive picked up a full time work load. monday through friday and a part time job on weekends in the kitchen i mentioned earlier to come up with the extra money we need to live comfortably (approximatley 50 hours a week) My issue and concern, and the reason for this post, is that i don't feel like my partner appreciates the hard work i put in to help make our lives comfortable. I am almost solely responsible for paying for groceries, gas for the car, utility bills, etc. sometimes she doesnt have enough for even her rent so i end up covering some, if not all of that too. she works one part time job 3-4 days a week, basically on call some weeks.

";1;"If you've tried to have a civil conversation with her about this and she isn't willing to negotiate despite the fact that she's aware this is negatively affecting you not just in terms of daily life existence, but also taking a toll on you emotionally then you need to reevaluate how this relationship is going to work out. Both partners should be contributing an equal percentage of work into the relationship in order for it to make sense, let alone thrive and this doesn't look promising. 

Have you tried budgeting with her? Is she aware of what the bills look like at all? You are absolutely not wrong to feel upset about this, because she's not doing right by you when she's simply ignoring her own responsibilities. I'd try sitting down with her and going through each of your bills, writing each of them down and doing some math so she can see what goes into your living expenses on paper. Let her know that you're supposed to work *together*, and that you're feeling a little bit let down by the fact that you're doing all the heavy lifting. Try to show her that you're wearing out, and that if things don't change soon, you might need to start making changes within your relationship in order to make your life expenses work, and that's not something you really want to do.

Dating guy with child;t3_8dbvc1;3;"Hi guys,

I really need your help here please as I am going desparated now
I met this guy 4 months ago when I was traveling to LA for my vacation. Quickly we clicked and bond together. We really enjoyed our every single moment there so we decided to keep contact and talk everyday when I came back to FL. We’re really open and transparent about our private life. I’ve never married or had a kid so everything is pretty simple from my side. He is actually still married, he and his wife submitted the divorce file and waiting for court hearing. They have 8 year old son and he’s mainly custody of the kid as his wife is flight attendant and unable to take care of the kid full time. 
So weeks ago he decided to bring his son with him to visit me. When his wife found out, she went crazy, they had fight, yelled to each other and she did everything to ruin his trip, acted like a b**** (as he said). Previously she was the one to control everything in their married life and he and his son have to do whatever she wants. Now since he’s with me, she may think that things are out of her control and therefore extremely upset about that. She tried everything to catch their attention, including putting herself in trouble (like sleeping pill overdose) and my boyfriend had to be there take care of her. 
Eventually my boyfriend still visited me 2 days ago. His son is pretty a good boy but his head is packed with all the bad things from his mother about me so he’s cold to me and dislike me. And my boyfriend is too soft to his every single request, with no rule for kids and I have feeling that he’s spoiling the kid a little too much. Whatever his son asks, he follows and I haven’t seen him say no to his son during 3 days here. He came here to visit me but we hardly hold hand, hug because his son sticks around him all the time and barely talk to me though I’ve been trying to be nice. He slept with his son as well and only came to my bed at 2 or 3am and then back to his son at 6am before he woke up. I feel like I am the person who is left out in my own house, everytime his son openly talk to me, his mom called and later on, he dislike me again.
I don’t really have experience with kid or dating a guy with kid so I am pretty lost here. I even feel a bit insecured because of my boyfriend’s enabling characteristic and the fact that his wife is having trouble with her boyfriend. I don’t know if it’s just my feeling or it’s common to all others who date a guy with kid. How could I do to get rid of this kind of feeling or what should I do to make this situation better, to make his son like me a bit more? Or will I have to run around and deal with his crazy wife if I still want to be with him in the future?
I really appreciate your advices please

In a really tough situation with a girl I like, don't know the best way to proceed;t3_8cs4e3;2;"Hello,

This is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if it's too much. I met a girl and I can tell she was really into me, but I'm very inexperienced with girls and relationships with people in general. 

We hung out a bunch of times, made out a couple of times and I can tell she was really into me - we have a bunch in common, both on very similar paths in life. But because of my inexperience, i had a hard time getting myself in a position to make a move, and consistently exude confidence and sexual energy, was always to hestiant when making a move, confused a lot by certain things (her being late to date and cutting them short, talking about other guys not making moves), didn't make my feelings apparent, and probably some other things, even though I knew this girl was into me. 

About a week ago, she gave me the ""I don't wanna date right now/don't think you wanna date me"" talk, and I didn't know how to handle it except in a very dishonest way saying I have a lot on plate too and I couldn't be fully invest, etc. But the thing is we live really close together and have a good thing going and she really likes connecting with people in any capacity so she's still wants to hang out and still texts and communicate with me, got me a small gift, and asked me to be a plus one at a wedding of a mutual friend. 

If I had to guess, I'm in the friend zone, but not 100%. I know the solution is to move on, but I know she's gonna be around and even though I know she might not feel about me that way, part of me really thinks I can change that if I don't try as hard, have fun with her at the wedding, make my feelings apparent,, and actually make a move and exude confidence, which I know I can.

Im in a really tough spot, and I should probably move on, but I'm gonna give it one more shot so I was wondering if anyone can provide any insight on how I should proceed. Naturally, I'm very to myself and I'm gonna have an instinct to be cold when I see her bc I don't wanna overstep my bounds with over communicating and still trying to reattract her and stuff- but I don't wanna completely cut her off bc I won't make it to the wedding that's in a month. So any insight on how proceed would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you";5;This might be a hard pill to swallow, but she does not seem into you when it comes to a relationship.. and that’s ok! You said you guys have similar interests, and that’s great but that doesn’t mean it will make a relationship... sure it would be nice if someone with similar interests and hobbies was into you (because those people don’t exactly fall from the sky) but that doesn’t mean she wants someone of similar interests in the way you do.. just because someone is a good fit for you doesn’t mean you’re a good fit for them;2;0.4;[[0.96722321]];[[0.5072874]];0.9914;0.11900000000000001;0.843;0.038;0.9890000000000001;0.308;0.682;0.01;-0.217;0.012670292670292668;0.2321078431372549;-0.21943755046696226

Admittedly I didn’t realize we had a class together at the time and there was only about 15 people in the class.  After the introduction she said that a group of them were going to the amusement park that weekend and extended and invite.   Looking back it was pretty genius on her part because it took the stress out of asking someone out and the pressure out of us going out for the first time.  This can be tricky though because the woman that you like may think that you just want to be friends. I’d say just introduce yourself there is nothing wrong with that.;2;2.0;[[0.97411165]];[[0.60090868]];0.9671;0.24;0.69;0.07;0.9072;0.134;0.821;0.044000000000000004;0.07999999999999997;0.041071428571428585;0.03571428571428571;0.00535714285714288
Lesbian by choice, cheater by idiocy;t3_8cps11;3;"So I have been with my gf for years now. I never exclusively dated women, but have before. For these past few years, I've been dedicated and loyal. I finally fucked up. 

First let me preface this whole situation with an explanation of the days leading up to my indiscretion... I went out of town with a friend and some of her friends as well. My gf had to work so I stayed solo for the first few nights. She came over later. 

One of the ppl staying with us is a gay guy who had invited a friend. I assumed he was gay as well and thought flirting was harmless considering. I've always been flirtatious but I don't act on it out of respect for my relationship. 

Ok so guy that I think is gay hangs out with me and we click. Everyone drinks, everyone parties. I was set up to sleep on the fold out and this guy is there as well. Its in the middle of the living room so I didn't feel too awkward about it... Plus the copious amounts of alcohol definitely blurred any lines of what would be appropriate. So I'm on the sleeper sofa and we are chatting when he mentions he recently broke up with his GF OF 8 years. I don't  know how he didn't get the memo about my gf, but he missed it. One of the things about being a lesbian and saying.gf means ppl hear "" girl who is a friend"" when that's what they want to hear. Either way, I was very sure to tell him I was in a relationship. He kept trying to make out with me and I was very adamant about being faithful. Eventually, he listened and we fell asleep. He did put his arm around me after I had fallen asleep. 

Next day, my gf is coming to hang out but not till late that night. We are all hungover so the majority of the day is spent doing nothing. He leaves and does whatever and returns later that night. I think everyone believed I had already had sex with him even though that definitely wasn't the case. 

Anyways, girls get dressed up, my gf makes it in town, I tell her about his sleeping on the sofa and how he didn't know I was gay and felt bad that I didn't make that clear. I am a very honest person. I told her I thought he was cute and flirted and initially believed he was gay too! She laughs it off and we all party again. 

At some point, my gf starts hanging with the guy and likes him too. She talks about potentially having a 3some with him. Obviously, I'm jazzed BC we clicked before and the only reason I'm not 100% happy in my relationship is due to the lack of... Well... That x factor men have. Literally everything else about our dynamic is perfection. We have a wonderful life together, but I'm not a tried and true lesbian. I love both women and men. 

Anyways, this threesome opportunity has me stoked and I'm not trying to keep distanced anymore. At some point my gf falls asleep on the couch and ppl go to bed one by one. I get in bed with her to try to wake her up. I was so excited about inviting someone into our relationship. 

Well, she doesn't wake up. I'm inebriated and in the mood. The guy gets in the bed with us. He could have slept on the other couch. I had told him he could sleep in the bed with us earlier in the night.... Along with some other not too subtle comments. 

Essentially, we start kissing and a bit of fooling around happened. Keep in mind my gf is in bed with us BC the whole threesome thing earlier and the mood from the night.

At one point, it actually happens. I didn't even remember it when first waking up the next day. Either way, it was brief and I stopped it. Being gay, I don't really need birth control either... So that's yet another thing to worry about. 

I am not innocent. I know I fucked up. I told my gf we made out and obviously she was hurt. I didn't even mention the latter part BC it was so brief and I was so out of it and didn't even remember it happened initially. At this point, should I tell her? 

He left the next morning and told me bye. When she saw that, she knew something was up. 
Everyone on vacation with us knows something happened and I'm sure this guy told them we had sex. I feel bad it happened and more bad that she's so embarrassed. We had a long lunch and left early... Probably making it more apparent that something was up. I left my shades in the room and when I went back up, he was walking in too. So I had to tell him why we were leaving and apologize. I think this guy is a nice person as well. He jokingly stated that I need to dump her to which I replied that the life I've built with her is too much to walk away from. 

Some of my friends cheat all the time. I never do. I haven't since I was very young. I just feel like I can't tell the full story to anyone. 

Thoughts? Any psychiatrists out there? What do I do? ";1;"It sounds to me like you're saying the sex wasn't actually consensual? If that is the case he raped you and therefore he is not a 'good guy'. Yes, you may have led him to believe you wanted sex by your earlier behaviour but if you didn't actually say yes when he was trying to penetrate you then it was rape.

You need to tell your girlfriend the whole story and you also really need to ask her if she is actually into the idea of a threesome when she's actually sober.

Lesbian by choice, cheater by idiocy;t3_8cps11;3;"So I have been with my gf for years now. I never exclusively dated women, but have before. For these past few years, I've been dedicated and loyal. I finally fucked up. 

First let me preface this whole situation with an explanation of the days leading up to my indiscretion... I went out of town with a friend and some of her friends as well. My gf had to work so I stayed solo for the first few nights. She came over later. 

One of the ppl staying with us is a gay guy who had invited a friend. I assumed he was gay as well and thought flirting was harmless considering. I've always been flirtatious but I don't act on it out of respect for my relationship. 

Ok so guy that I think is gay hangs out with me and we click. Everyone drinks, everyone parties. I was set up to sleep on the fold out and this guy is there as well. Its in the middle of the living room so I didn't feel too awkward about it... Plus the copious amounts of alcohol definitely blurred any lines of what would be appropriate. So I'm on the sleeper sofa and we are chatting when he mentions he recently broke up with his GF OF 8 years. I don't  know how he didn't get the memo about my gf, but he missed it. One of the things about being a lesbian and saying.gf means ppl hear "" girl who is a friend"" when that's what they want to hear. Either way, I was very sure to tell him I was in a relationship. He kept trying to make out with me and I was very adamant about being faithful. Eventually, he listened and we fell asleep. He did put his arm around me after I had fallen asleep. 

Next day, my gf is coming to hang out but not till late that night. We are all hungover so the majority of the day is spent doing nothing. He leaves and does whatever and returns later that night. I think everyone believed I had already had sex with him even though that definitely wasn't the case. 

Anyways, girls get dressed up, my gf makes it in town, I tell her about his sleeping on the sofa and how he didn't know I was gay and felt bad that I didn't make that clear. I am a very honest person. I told her I thought he was cute and flirted and initially believed he was gay too! She laughs it off and we all party again. 

At some point, my gf starts hanging with the guy and likes him too. She talks about potentially having a 3some with him. Obviously, I'm jazzed BC we clicked before and the only reason I'm not 100% happy in my relationship is due to the lack of... Well... That x factor men have. Literally everything else about our dynamic is perfection. We have a wonderful life together, but I'm not a tried and true lesbian. I love both women and men. 

Anyways, this threesome opportunity has me stoked and I'm not trying to keep distanced anymore. At some point my gf falls asleep on the couch and ppl go to bed one by one. I get in bed with her to try to wake her up. I was so excited about inviting someone into our relationship. 

Well, she doesn't wake up. I'm inebriated and in the mood. The guy gets in the bed with us. He could have slept on the other couch. I had told him he could sleep in the bed with us earlier in the night.... Along with some other not too subtle comments. 

Essentially, we start kissing and a bit of fooling around happened. Keep in mind my gf is in bed with us BC the whole threesome thing earlier and the mood from the night. At some point, he tries to get on top of me and actually have sex. I don't allow it. I turn on my side and cuddle my gf and he continues to rub and try to penetrate.

I'd talk to your girlfriend about it. Tell her everything that happened, and re prioritize her. 

He joked about you needing to dump her? Not a funny joke. To be honest I don't think you respect your girlfriend enough. She deserves all the information so she can decide if she wants to stay with you or not. Cheating really sucks and most relationships won't recover from it.

Um, yes?  Cheating aside for the moment, you had unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history it doesn't sound like you took the time to vet.  You need to get tested, and she needs to know to exercise precaution so she doesn't pick anything up from you until you come back with a clean bill of health.

As for the cheating, well, you two need to talk about that as well.  You're making a *lot* of excuses for a *lot* of bad choices here, starting with your assumption that it was ""safe"" to flirt with this guy and culminating in your continued insistence that he's really nice and totally wasn't trying to come between you and your girlfriend.  If you're going to try opening up the relationship on a more regular basis - and I wouldn't recommend that until you've fixed the damage from this incident, which is going to take a long, *long* time - everybody involved needs to know and be on board with the ground rules, and you need to proceed slowly and with sober heads.  Not get too drunk to make smart decisions and just ""let things happen"" because that's what *you* want, without thinking through the consequences or how that's going to affect your partner.";2;2.0;[[0.97434252]];[[0.57114207]];0.9967;0.14;0.7829999999999999;0.076;-0.6429;0.08;0.83;0.09;0.07400000000000001;0.09684156378600824;0.09338624338624342;0.0034553203997648163

Lost my job last year, recently got a new one, just embarking on saving a lot more money.

Give BF half the rent costs (basically paying towards his mortgage) and I buy the groceries and do all cooking and  cleaning. 

Boyfriend's Father had long term health issues, but was not in any way terminal by Medicare's definition.

Broke some bones and then developed a very serious health problem solely related to that.

Instead of continuing to recover in the hospital, BF's Mother basically got a Doctor to sign off on hospice and stop all life sustaining treatment.

Even though they had mid x,xxx,xxx in savings, BF's Mother refused to send her husband to a good hospital or top doctors. Just relied on medicare for everything. 

My boyfriend involved me in all of it and wanted my research skills to help back his case that his Dad wanted to live, not go die in a hospice.

I told him that committing Medicare fraud should be enough to scare the Doctor off.

Sadly, his Dad who was completely lucid was taken off life sustaining treatment and given morphine over a 24 hour period.

Poor man went from yelling at his wife to ""shut up"" and ""let me rest"" to dying within 24 hours.

Long story, but it is all craziness and BF will be filing a lawsuit.

BF's brother didn't have a good relationship with their Dad. He was always rude and arrogant towards their Dad.

BF told me that the last thing the Dad said to his brother was he was ""special"". 
He always said this to the brother meaning special as in mentally handicapped.  
You had to be there to get the humor.

Accordingly, he didn't put any fight when he was told his Dad would be sent to hospice.

BF's brother has always seemed like a socipath to me (trying to grab me when he was drunk, telling people he smarter than anyone he knows, bad mouthing every ex gf as crazy)

I never thought of BF's Mother as a Sociopath until she basically conspired with the Doctor to send her husband to hospice suddenly.

So after BF's Dad died, his Mother had the entire viewing, funeral and luncheon planned and scheduled. No one is Jewish, so there was no rush required to bury the body so fast.

But she called us both up to tell us to rest up because it would be a very busy week with all the people she was inviting.

WTF?

She managed not to invite a single real friend of her husband.
 She planned the funeral so quickly that his older relatives and poorer family didn;t have time to schedule cross country trips to attend.

So the viewing/funeral only consisted of her former work colleagues, neighbors and her family.

His sister just wrote a long email how she was sad she didn't get to attend her last living sibling's funeral. 
   
Since the funeral, bf pointed out to me how his brother is behaving on instagram. 

He posted a few days after the funeral.
It consisted of a post showing a bottle of booze and a long and flowing list of hashtags and @  a long list of people who gave him stuff because his Father died. It doesn;t sound that bad, but it was a basically like a thank you for winning an oscar. He ended his dumb posting by saying everyone should ""Revel in this #circleoflife"" WTH? Who says that ?
He also put his location as the cemetary itself, so now anyone looking up the cemetary will see this idiotic post. FFS.

But what my BF was really showing em is how his brother is just back to taking selfies at dinner and going to every shallow event possible.
Sure, some could say we all process grief differently, but this bozo seems to be living it up.

Back to boyfriend's Mother.
Two days after burying her Husband she let it slip how she is glad to have more time now for her Charity work. WTH?

She then went on a long beach spa holiday with friends.

When she returned she asked my BF why he hadn't filed the will for probate and gotten all the finances together. (he is the executor)

She expects him to do all the heavy lifting and in turn is acting the happiest I have ever seen her. 

Well, I wouldn't care so much about their weird behavior, but my bf is acting horrid also. I expected him to be upset and messed up since he loved his Dad.

But he is basically torturing me verbally.

He has brought up breaking up several times now.

And it got so bad that he told me I should just take my dogs and leave immediately.

I reminded him that I've given him a lot of money over the years and that I'm in a bad situation right now since I'm just starting a new job and need to get money saved up.

He then told me I am stupid and worthless and a begger would make more money than I have the last several months.

He then told me maybe I should go sell flowers on side of highway like he sees losers doing every day. 

WTH?  I'm bright as can be so insults like that make me both livid and stunned. 

He was drinking heavily, but his vitriol fueled rant went on for 15 minutes.
I even recorded half of it and uploaded it to my private server.

Yeah, it freaked me out that much. 

I don't understand how he could be so cold and hateful when I've been so loving and sweet and helpful.     

Do these sound like grief stricken people or a bunch of sociopaths?

And it got so bad that he told me I should just take my dogs and leave immediately.

I reminded him that I've given him a lot of money over the years and that I'm in a bad situation right now since I'm just starting a new job and need to get money saved up.

He then told me I am stupid and worthless and a begger would make more money than I have the last several months.

He then told me maybe I should go sell flowers on side of highway like he sees losers doing every day. 

WTH?  I'm bright as can be so insults like that make me both livid and stunned. 

He was drinking heavily, but his vitriol fueled rant went on for 15 minutes.
I even recorded half of it and uploaded it to my private server.

Yeah, it freaked me out that much. 

I don't understand how he could be so cold and hateful when I've been so loving and sweet and helpful.     

Do these sound like grief stricken people or a bunch of sociopaths?

";2;"That... is a lot to process. Even for me and I'm not the one living through it.

Honestly I don't think you should let yourself become susceptible to his verbal assault - even though he's going through a hard time, none of this falls on you.

[34/F] afraid that BF [38/M] and his family may be a bunch of sociopaths, time to run screaming?;t3_8cm5t8;4;"Together with BF 5 years, living in his house for 4 of those years.

Lost my job last year, recently got a new one, just embarking on saving a lot more money.

Give BF half the rent costs (basically paying towards his mortgage) and I buy the groceries and do all cooking and  cleaning. 

Boyfriend's Father had long term health issues, but was not in any way terminal by Medicare's definition.

Broke some bones and then developed a very serious health problem solely related to that.

Instead of continuing to recover in the hospital, BF's Mother basically got a Doctor to sign off on hospice and stop all life sustaining treatment.

Even though they had mid x,xxx,xxx in savings, BF's Mother refused to send her husband to a good hospital or top doctors. Just relied on medicare for everything. 

My boyfriend involved me in all of it and wanted my research skills to help back his case that his Dad wanted to live, not go die in a hospice.

I told him that committing Medicare fraud should be enough to scare the Doctor off.

Sadly, his Dad who was completely lucid was taken off life sustaining treatment and given morphine over a 24 hour period.

Poor man went from yelling at his wife to ""shut up"" and ""let me rest"" to dying within 24 hours.

Long story, but it is all craziness and BF will be filing a lawsuit.

BF's brother didn't have a good relationship with their Dad. He was always rude and arrogant towards their Dad.

BF told me that the last thing the Dad said to his brother was he was ""special"". 
He always said this to the brother meaning special as in mentally handicapped.  
You had to be there to get the humor.

Accordingly, he didn't put any fight when he was told his Dad would be sent to hospice.

BF's brother has always seemed like a socipath to me (trying to grab me when he was drunk, telling people he smarter than anyone he knows, bad mouthing every ex gf as crazy)

I never thought of BF's Mother as a Sociopath until she basically conspired with the Doctor to send her husband to hospice suddenly.

So after BF's Dad died, his Mother had the entire viewing, funeral and luncheon planned and scheduled. No one is Jewish, so there was no rush required to bury the body so fast.

But she called us both up to tell us to rest up because it would be a very busy week with all the people she was inviting.

WTF?

She managed not to invite a single real friend of her husband.
 She planned the funeral so quickly that his older relatives and poorer family didn;t have time to schedule cross country trips to attend.

So the viewing/funeral only consisted of her former work colleagues, neighbors and her family.

His sister just wrote a long email how she was sad she didn't get to attend her last living sibling's funeral. 
   
Since the funeral, bf pointed out to me how his brother is behaving on instagram. 

He posted a few days after the funeral.
It consisted of a post showing a bottle of booze and a long and flowing list of hashtags and @  a long list of people who gave him stuff because his Father died. It doesn;t sound that bad, but it was a basically like a thank you for winning an oscar. He ended his dumb posting by saying everyone should ""Revel in this #circleoflife"" WTH? Who says that ?
He also put his location as the cemetary itself, so now anyone looking up the cemetary will see this idiotic post. FFS.

But what my BF was really showing em is how his brother is just back to taking selfies at dinner and going to every shallow event possible.
Sure, some could say we all process grief differently, but this bozo seems to be living it up.

Back to boyfriend's Mother.
Two days after burying her Husband she let it slip how she is glad to have more time now for her Charity work. WTH?

She then went on a long beach spa holiday with friends.

When she returned she asked my BF why he hadn't filed the will for probate and gotten all the finances together. (he is the executor)

She expects him to do all the heavy lifting and in turn is acting the happiest I have ever seen her. 

Well, I wouldn't care so much about their weird behavior, but my bf is acting horrid also. I expected him to be upset and messed up since he loved his Dad.

But he is basically torturing me verbally.

He has brought up breaking up several times now.

And it got so bad that he told me I should just take my dogs and leave immediately.

How can I reconcile all of this, and how can I healthily move forward?";3;I went through a similar situation last year. I am 22 my girlfriend was 21 and we had been dating for 3 years. I loved her very much as she did I. She was my best friend for years and we didn’t get into fights very often, the ones we did get into were mostly dumb things and some jealous issues that just showed how much we cared about each other. I just couldn’t see her as the woman I would marry. We are both in college and I thought it would be best to end our relationship. Even though I didn’t want it to end yet, I knew the earlier it ended the better it would be for both of us. She would resent me if we dated for 3 more years and then ended things because I would have taken away 6 years of her life where she could have done other things while being single. I truly think I did the best thing for her and that makes me very happy because I still care about her deeply even though we haven’t spoken in about a year since the breakup. If you are having doubts now, they will not go away and things are only going to get harder in the future. I think it would be best for both of you to split up sooner rather than taking more time of each other’s lives even though the result will be the same. ;3;1.0;[[0.97625979]];[[0.70891103]];0.9864;0.161;0.7490000000000001;0.08900000000000001;0.9836;0.155;0.797;0.049;-0.03399999999999999;0.19094728800611155;0.27754285714285715;-0.0865955691367456

She means the world to me, and I’ve hurt her by not being up front about how I’ve felt for too long. She saw me as her forever partner and I’m confident that she would take me back, but I know can’t be with her at least until I’m positive about what I want and know whether she’s a part of that. What is difficult and confusing for me, is that I’ve always longed for a life-long relationship, and in terms of the kind of person I would want to share that with, she fits the bill in every way, and so it feels illogical to let her go. But I can’t shake these feelings, which are riddled with feelings of wanting to explore this life changing time single as well. I feel like what I feel contradicts what I’ve always said I’ve wanted, and so I feel lost and confused and like I don’t quite know myself anymore. What makes these twice as difficult is that while she is hurt and angry, she’s also still understanding, loving, and supportive of the fact that I have some soul searching to do, even at her detriment. 

How can I reconcile all of this, and how can I healthily move forward?";3;You’re 23.  Keep moving forward. Keep growing.  Date more women.

I [22m] was talking to a girl [18f] for a while before things broke off. But lately she seems to be reengaging?;t3_8dbd0q;2;"TL;DR at the bottom

We flirted for just over a month and hung out a few times before going on a short date. The date was fine, but a few days later we got into an argument over some misunderstandings and that continued for a few weeks for one reason or another. It ended on a bitter note and I accepted it was dead, so I apologized and wished her well.  

A week after saying goodbye through text, I noticed she was reading our conversation on Snapchat on a Saturday night (it said that she was typing). I removed her on Snap, which removes the conversation from her chat, so she had to intentionally look me up to reread the conversation. She's always busy during the weekdays with school, and she works long hours most evenings. So I'm not sure why she was rereading the conversation that late unless she was at home.

I texted her about it that night and she played dumb at first, but then she admitted she accidentally did it. I asked if she was okay, and then she said she was and asked why. I waited till the following night to respond, and that's when she seemed to be interested in maintaining a conversation with me all of a sudden. And it wasn't just a blunt conversation - she made sure I knew she was preoccupied and wouldn't respond right away. The tone was more positive than it had been recently, and we had a good talk about random things before she said she was going to bed. I said goodnight, and then she tried to continue the conversation again. It was clear to me that she had missed talking to me in some fashion, and the peculiarity didn't stop there. 

She then sent me pictures of a few things she got the day before and asked me for my opinion, including a stuffed animal. I asked her where they came from and she said a friend bought the stuffed animal for her because she had ""been wanting it forever."" I thought it was weird for her to bring this up because one of the things we had a rough conversation about was gifts. She would always seem flustered whenever I would mention getting or making her something before. But before I really had a chance to react, she changed the conversation and asked me if my phone wasn't working. I asked why, and she said she tried to call me but it went straight to voicemail....

**This girl has never called me...**

In fact, I would say she avoided phone calls whenever I suggested it before. And my phone didn't even ring. I said there was nothing wrong with it, so I tried to call her. She then abruptly said ""well it doesn't matter anymore goodnight.""

At this point, a flag went off, and I saw that interaction two ways: Either she was talking to someone - the one who got her the stuff - and was unsure about him, so she wanted to see how things were with me still. Or she was just being friendly because she missed talking to me...which is weird, because we had spent more time fighting with each other by the time we stopped talking. Hell, maybe she just wanted attention.

The mistake I made before was assuming the worst. Things changed completely when I even implied that she was leading me on, and she got really upset that I overthought everything, so right now I'm keeping my distance and giving her space. I've been assuming a duck is a duck, but her unusual behavior has me cautious.

Anyway, she didn't message me for a week after that, when she suddenly sent a ""sup bud"" around the same time on a Saturday night. She has male siblings/cousins, so it's not too unusual for her to talk like that, but then she asks me how my day was - which she almost never did either. Apparently she fell asleep soon after that, and about 24 hours later, she apologized for falling asleep on me. She then asked me to guess what she got again. That was 3 days ago and she hasn't told me what it is yet.

I'm not expecting a response until the weekend again, so I'm trying to figure out what to say, or if I should say anything to her first before that. She's admitted to being way too busy for a relationship right now and her best friend described her as ""a guy magnet wherever she works"", so I don't think she really has any reason to talk to me anymore, even if she wanted attention. And yet, here we are. Why has she been acting strange lately? And why the abrupt delay between messages? And more importantly, do I keep going at her once a week pace, or do I bare minimum initiate a conversation or phone call? I'm assuming I should let her make all the moves, but I'm not certain.

Any thoughts are appreciated.

My [18M] Ex-Fiance [18F] just asked for a break 2 weeks ago and I'm having a hard time and she really isn't;t3_8cuppq;5;"Some backstory before I get to the actual advice asking.
I had a major bout with depression in high school where I was completely unsure of where my life was going. I started homeschooling and started talking to this girl who had just lost her mom and also homeschooled. We talked for 9 months and finally saw each other for the first time in years on December 3, 2016. 23 days later we became official. I honestly couldn't tell you why but things moved very fast. I ended giving her a promise ring in June of 2017 and then 6 months later on December 2, 2017 I proposed and we got engaged. About a month earlier I got a job that I intended on making my career and gained a sense of pride and then was laid off the day after Christmas. That really crushed me and I became pretty depressed again. My fiance was really the only one holding me afloat. She had been moved out and on her own for a while so I moved in with her and at the point life was good. I had everything going for me I had the girl, the job, and I was already moved out unlike everyone else my age I knew. Then it all went downhill. I got laid off December 26th. I did everything I could to get my job back over the next few months and then March 31st rolled around. I had been depressed because of the job and the only person I wanted to be by my side was her, but the morning of March 31st, she asked me if we could take a break. She wanted to focus and herself and move closer to her job but wanted me to stay and pursue the job that gave me so much pride and happiness. I was absolutely crushed. Its been two weeks and I've cried every day. My family is there for me and I know they love me but I'm in so much pain. My mother and grandmother were literally on their knees in front of my while I was sitting on the couch begging me not to hurt myself the day it happened. Everything that was going for me crumbled right under my feet. The job, the girl, and moving out. All gone. I'm right back to the lost place I was in back in high school. Her and I are still going to be friends but we're moving out of our apartment in about 2 weeks. She will be moving two hours away and I will move back in with my parents. We're going to stay in contact and try to re kindle what we once had over time while we grow individually. Sorry for the long backstory but I felt that is was necessary for you guys to know. I'm finally getting to the part about asking for advice lol. She is currently on a work related trip and shes having a great time. Shes posting all over social media and she looks so happy while I'm sitting alone in an apartment suffering. I can't help but notice how happy she is without me. She has seemed fine since it all happened and to be honest I don't think I've even seen her shed a tear. My question/questions are: why is her happiness making me so sad? Why do I feel so alone even though I have my whole family who I know loves and supports me? I'm in so much pain and I need some major advice on how to get over it. 

tl;dr My fiance asked for a break and I'm having a really hard time getting over it. She seems to be perfectly with the whole situation and I'm suffering. ";1;"

My [18M] Ex-Fiance [18F] just asked for a break 2 weeks ago and I'm having a hard time and she really isn't;t3_8cuppq;5;"Some backstory before I get to the actual advice asking.
I had a major bout with depression in high school where I was completely unsure of where my life was going. I started homeschooling and started talking to this girl who had just lost her mom and also homeschooled. We talked for 9 months and finally saw each other for the first time in years on December 3, 2016. 23 days later we became official. I honestly couldn't tell you why but things moved very fast. I ended giving her a promise ring in June of 2017 and then 6 months later on December 2, 2017 I proposed and we got engaged. About a month earlier I got a job that I intended on making my career and gained a sense of pride and then was laid off the day after Christmas. That really crushed me and I became pretty depressed again. My fiance was really the only one holding me afloat. She had been moved out and on her own for a while so I moved in with her and at the point life was good. I had everything going for me I had the girl, the job, and I was already moved out unlike everyone else my age I knew. Then it all went downhill. I got laid off December 26th. I did everything I could to get my job back over the next few months and then March 31st rolled around. I had been depressed because of the job and the only person I wanted to be by my side was her, but the morning of March 31st, she asked me if we could take a break. She wanted to focus and herself and move closer to her job but wanted me to stay and pursue the job that gave me so much pride and happiness. I was absolutely crushed. Its been two weeks and I've cried every day. My family is there for me and I know they love me but I'm in so much pain. My mother and grandmother were literally on their knees in front of my while I was sitting on the couch begging me not to hurt myself the day it happened. Everything that was going for me crumbled right under my feet. The job, the girl, and moving out. All gone. I'm right back to the lost place I was in back in high school. Her and I are still going to be friends but we're moving out of our apartment in about 2 weeks. She will be moving two hours away and I will move back in with my parents. We're going to stay in contact and try to re kindle what we once had over time while we grow individually. Sorry for the long backstory but I felt that is was necessary for you guys to know. I'm finally getting to the part about asking for advice lol. She is currently on a work related trip and shes having a great time. Shes posting all over social media and she looks so happy while I'm sitting alone in an apartment suffering. I can't help but notice how happy she is without me.

It seems you've posted a huge wall of text.
This is a bit daunting for users browsing reddit, so they're unlikely to read the whole thing.

It's ok to write a lot if you've got a lot to say. But perhaps you could insert some empty lines into your post, to break it into smaller, more palatable paragraphs?

I moved in with my boyfriend and I’ve moved down on his priority list?;t3_8da1on;4;"I moved in with my long distance boyfriend about a month ago. Since then, he’s joined THREE recreational sports leagues with practice or games 1-2 nights per week each (3-6 nights per week), and now is joining a boxing class once a week. I communicated to him that I feel neglected - I just moved to a new city to be with him, expecting to be with him more often and to try to make a life together. It seems he’s making a life without me and just has me to go to sleep with, and clean and cook etc. when I expressed this, he said “i guess I’ll have to miss a night or two a week.” And I replied by asking if he wanted to or not and that I didn’t want to feel guilty for wanting to be with him. He told me he didn’t want to, he likes doing these things, but sarcastically said “this is my life, it is what it is” . I feel like it’s a chore for him to hang out with me or want to be with me. 
Also, we were supposed to go away in July, and he told me he no longer could go because he couldn’t afford it (several bachelor parties have come up and he’s choosing to go to them. He told me “we live together we can do anything whenever” when I told him I was upset about it).

Any thoughts on this? I’m pretty upset and not sure where to turn for advice. ";2;"Hello there, I am in a relationship too and I have moved with my girlfriend this year. I think I can understand your story pretty well since my girlfriend and I already discussed about it. As we are both studying, we have very few time at home ( I use to come back home only at 19 o clock) and the remaining time is dedicated to do the odd jobs like cooking, cleaning and of course homeworks. One day my girlfriend told me that our relationship was truly different than before and almost ""dead"", and that affected me a lot but I realised many things too. 

I think that your reaction is absolutely normal and human. I think sometimes boys need a warning because they may not perceive things like you. Now I definitively advice you to have a serious discussion with your friend, you can tell him that you feel alone for instance and see how he reacts. If he absolutely doesn't care, believe me this guy is not worth it. You must feel safe and listened in a relationship, if any of this two pillars is absent I am almost sure you are in a toxic situation. 
Now another thing : you should definitively try to find common interests, if you haven't already. I used to make a lot of music before, and I understood this could endanger our relationship. After talking to my girlfriend, we made some choices : I would spend less time on my ""personnal"" hobbies and she would stay at home some week ends instead of going back to her parents. Trust me, this may seem like a pretty small change but it has completely changed our relationship. And it is pretty easy ! We have watched so many movies, we have bought a Nintendo Switch to play together, we went to the cinema...And this is when I understood how precious she was to me : by spending time with her. So I see you've made many efforts to be able to spend time with your boyfriend, and you should really convinve him to do the same thing. 
I think that if he really loves you he will inderstand very easily, and this is the key point. However if he insists on saying that his personnal hobbies are more important than you, you have to react. Moreover you must feel confident, or at least makes it look like you won't change your mind. You can't spend your life with someone that treats you like a ""hobby"". Can you imagine creating a family this way ? 

Eventually I think that all of your thoughts are absolutely human. Then I want to warn you that living together may be a bit difficult at first, and this is why you have to adapt. Test him, but do it seriously, you can even go to sleep in another home without telling him so as to make him know you're serious. If he doesn't react you are in a very risky relationship : even if you are in love you have think about it seriously because one day it may be too late.

I hope this will help you, and of course feel free to ask me anything !
Have a nice day :)";3;1.5;[[0.98077536]];[[0.70972016]];-0.0754;0.07200000000000001;0.855;0.073;0.9979;0.179;0.773;0.048;-0.132;0.06548821548821547;0.1297569444444445;-0.06426872895622901

I was hesitant at first because I know he was going to be overseas for a good part of the summer but he talked me about the positive things of making it official so I agreed in the end.

We sort of agreed one sleepy night that we’ll take a break once he goes away. So I asked him recently about breaking up. He said we should take a break and then reconnect once he gets back. I told him that maybe ending the relationship now would be better because he’s decided to take a break when he goes away anyway. 

He doesn’t want to end things now. He says we should keep in contact when he’s away and he doesn’t want to be put in a position where he will be cheating on me. 

I feel hurt and pained. I told him if we break up there will be no reconnecting happening and he asked why? Why can’t we reconnect? Why can’t we just pick it up where we left? 

In the end, we couldnt agree on anything so we decided to take a step back and just pick it up some other time. He then gave me a hug and said “You do know I like you right? I like you. I really do.” 

Help! Should I just break up with him now or just go with what he says. Is taking a 2 months break and picking things up where we left off really a thing?";2;Are you in high school?

ONE person decides they are done with the relationship and says, ""I'm done."" And there you are, single again. No matter what the other person feels, suggests, wants, demands, cries for -- the relationship no longer exists. YOU DO NOT NEED PERMISSION OR AGREEMENT TO BREAK UP WITH HIM. You don't need him to agree with you, you don't need to explain your reasons, you don't have to comfort him. You've done all the talking, and he refused to accept your decision. HE DOESN'T GET A VOTE. He can decide what flavor of ice cream he dives into while listening to Patsy Cline and watching Bollywood films, but he can't overrule your decision to break up. 

He's refused to listen to you in person, so send him an email or text. ""Yeah, listen, I thought about our discussion and I'm still not interested in continuing this relationship. I'm not available for any further discussions about this, I'm comfortable with my decision. Good luck overseas, I hope you have a great summer."" Send it and BLOCK HIM on all social networks. He doesn't get in the house. You don't agree to meet him here, there or anywhere. He's steamrolled over you once, you're still vulnerable to that tactic, so you hold onto your autonomy by NOT meeting with him or discussing YOUR decision any further.

I [20/f] need some advice about my feelings or actions towards my crush [21m];t3_8d2xg5;4;"I know this is a bit silly, and deep down inside, I might actually know the answer.

That being said, here is some background info: I met my crush (let's call him T) in a mmorpg game where building a community and guilds are what makes the game fun. Along the way, I became the 3rd in command of a guild that I stayed with for around 1 or 2 years. During this time period, I met T. He was someone who was funny, someone who I could joke and talk with for a few hours without being bored. He was someone I've come to like. However, I don't believe we are meant to be. I began to notice some changes, or rather.... the difference in treatment I get from him. I felt that he liked my friend J, as he asked her to marry him in the game (usually people don't marry often just because of how expensive it is for a simple marriage). Knowing this.... I decided to back off. It was clear to me that he only viewed me as a friend, nothing more and nothing less. I've actually confessed to him.... in another language because I was too shy and I felt that by getting it out, even if he doesn't understand, I could let go and move on. This was not the case, since I'm still here today aha. 

Eventually, I stopped playing the game for a while, as well as stopping communication except for a few messages every few months. It was nothing long, nothing serious... but either way, I hoped that I moved on. Nope... I came back to the game and he did as well. Not sure if we came back at the same time, but I found him today and we talked for a long time, catching up. This made me realize how much I missed him and how I wanted to keep talking with him. Deep down, my gut is telling me that he isn't someone that would be actually compatible with me. How can I just move on from this?

I also signed up for a $10 monthly makeup subscription box. I know that sounds counterproductive, but then I get my monthly “fix” of fun new stuff, while still keeping myself from spending a lot of money. It’s my one “treat” for the month. 

Also, make a savings jar for the big thing she’s saving up for. Put a label on it that says “spring break trip!” Or “new laptop!” Or whatever she’s saving up for. Then duct tape it shut (with a slit to put money in) so she can’t get into it easily to take money out. This will be a visual reminder of what she’s saving up for.

He said as time went on in the relationship, he could see I wasn't what he wanted.

Well, but that raises the question: is he really capable of loving anyone?  As you yourself point out, he couldn't even be bothered to treat you with baseline respect, which is kind of a necessary component for a healthy relationship.  And he didn't exactly get things off to a good start with the new girl, either, considering he didn't think she needed to know about you.  Finish getting him out of your life for good and focus on undoing the damage he's done.

Do not let this guy make you feel like this. I imagine the “good times” were just him kinda acting like a decent person. The good does not outweigh the bad, yes? He is using you. He is an emotional vampire. The best thing you can do is move on and be happy. 

He will say whatever he thinks will benefit him. You do not want this guy in your life, do you? I mean, he can’t even take responsibility. His actions are his. You could scream at him everyday about whatever and his actions would still be his fault. You can’t make him do anything. He is shifting the blame to you, because he isn’t mature enough to act like a decent person. Hell, if you caused his problems do you know what a normal person would do? Break up. But he didn’t do that, because he is abusive. He gets off on emotionally and mentally controlling people. And he is still trying to do it to you even now. 

Do not be his friend. It is more manipulation. One day his new girl will see him for who he is and leave him. Don’t be his fall back plan.

Girlfriend feels empty and I try to help her;t3_8cis5p;5;"Hello


Me and my SO have been together for over a year and these past months have been getting worse. She constantly feels empty, alone and without motivation. We even broke up february 2018 but got together two weeks after because we were not ready to go on without each other. 


One of the problems is how she can't get over my ex (not really an ex but to not make it confusing there you go) after I told her about us. I know it's a terrible idea however, I really did believe she would seek my current SO and tell her what happened. I felt it was necessary to tell her. My ex became an obsession to her where she stalked her social media and even drew pictures of her. 


I have done wrong too. Sometimes I ignored her, was irratated and mad at her when I really shouldn't. I told her everytime I would change that way and how I regret it however, we still broke up because she felt she needed to be alone to fix her problems.


After we got together it seems worse. Maybe it's just my perspective but it seems like I am the one to try to things together. The other day we decided to sleep at my place but she changed her mind because she wanted to be able to sleep well for a test next day. After a fight that ended with me telling her no busses would take her there she said she wanted to stay at my place. This makes me feel manipulated even though I don't want to believe. There has been other instances too where I feel just used because she wants to fix her problem, not because she wants to be with me


Any advice is appreciated


TL;DR Girlfriend feels empty, I try to help her but it seems she wants to have me only because she wants to fix her problems after we got together again.";5;"I genuinely think she is going through depression.

The fact that you want to help her is amazing but you also have to set boundaries. She is ill and she have to recognise it and seek help, regarding her state you can support her if you choose to but at the end of the day there is very little you can do (and that’s also why it is heartbreaking and hard to accept).

A relationship is always a choice, you can choose to stay and going through it with her which is not gonna be an easy thing. But you can also choose no leave that relationship because it is hard and you have to keep in mind that it is okay too ! In this case it is not being selfish, it is important to tell yourself that maybe you don’t have the strength to go through it and to protect yourself.

This illness is a hell of a burden, it is insidious, change people and if often perceived as a mood like you can shake it off.

Now you have to communicate with her, knowing where she is standing at, where she “think” she is as well because depression change a lot the perceptions. 


I wish you all the best of luck, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need to ...


Edit : seeking help is often see as seing a therapist which can be effective, but it doesn’t work for everyone. She will have to find what suit her it can be group talk, counselling, medication (even tho it can’t be a long term solution it can help to find the “kicker”, the strength to face the real problem), but also “parallel medicine” such as hypnotherapy, magnetizer (these last ones can be hard to find because you have to find truly skilled people)

If she's hard to carry, then you have to tell her that and possibly end it for real, the reason you got back together is because once you broke off, you both felt empty, because you still somewhat fill each others' holes, but sometimes it's better to feel empty than to be in a toxic relationship, at this point i think you realize that she's beyond fixable and if you both keep this up it won't end well..

 Sometimes solutions aren't enough and walking away is the only option";1;0.2;[[0.93055465]];[[0.62318035]];-0.9943;0.043;0.7659999999999999;0.192;0.4098;0.053;0.882;0.065;-0.13699999999999998;-0.0827380952380952;-0.009166666666666679;-0.07357142857142851
Girlfriend feels empty and I try to help her;t3_8cis5p;5;"Hello


Me and my SO have been together for over a year and these past months have been getting worse. She constantly feels empty, alone and without motivation. We even broke up february 2018 but got together two weeks after because we were not ready to go on without each other. 


One of the problems is how she can't get over my ex (not really an ex but to not make it confusing there you go) after I told her about us. I know it's a terrible idea however, I really did believe she would seek my current SO and tell her what happened. I felt it was necessary to tell her. My ex became an obsession to her where she stalked her social media and even drew pictures of her. 


I have done wrong too. Sometimes I ignored her, was irratated and mad at her when I really shouldn't. I told her everytime I would change that way and how I regret it however, we still broke up because she felt she needed to be alone to fix her problems.


After we got together it seems worse. Maybe it's just my perspective but it seems like I am the one to try to things together. The other day we decided to sleep at my place but she changed her mind because she wanted to be able to sleep well for a test next day. After a fight that ended with me telling her no busses would take her there she said she wanted to stay at my place. This makes me feel manipulated even though I don't want to believe. There has been other instances too where I feel just used because she wants to fix her problem, not because she wants to be with me

TL;DR Girlfriend feels empty, I try to help her but it seems she wants to have me only because she wants to fix her problems after we got together again.";5;"Her mental health doesn't sound great if I'm honest. In my most recent relationship, I actually had a period where I got obsessed with my partner's ex (who was emotionally abusive to him), although not to the point where I was drawing pictures of her... I reckon the obsession is either likely coming from a place of insecurity or of protectiveness (like how it was for me), but it's not healthy. I think maybe she needs to be alone right now to focus on working on herself, going to therapy and improving her mental health...

I'm in a similar-ish situation to you rn, except my partner is the one suffering from severe depression rn and we're currently broken up because he feels unable to be in a relationship right now. Believe me I know how much depression can affect a relationship, but remember the person you love is still in there, they're just not very well right now and the illness is making it hard for them to find their sense of self!

Depression is a common cause of feeling empty and alone, even if someone is showing you love. It could also be an explanation for the low self esteem that's causing her to get obsessive over your ex. I would say don't give up on her just get, but try to take a step back - if she is depressed (as I suspect she is from what you're saying), but you still want to be in a relationship with her, reassure her that you still care for her but you need to take a step back so that you can sort out how you're feeling while she focuses on getting better - if she refuses to see a doctor and get professional help dealing with what sounds like a deep rooted self esteem problem, then it's better for you to leave and not give her the option on pinning it on you to fix her problems. Only she can get past what's going on in her head right now.";1;0.2;[[0.96589169]];[[0.76079265]];-0.9943;0.043;0.7659999999999999;0.192;-0.9708;0.111;0.708;0.18100000000000002;-0.07900000000000003;-0.0827380952380952;0.08171393557422968;-0.16445203081232487

I would think if you're in a truly wonderful relationship and start to feel the beginnings of a crush - just cut it off with the crush. Do not pursue any kind of contact (other than professional if you work together). If you pursue any kind of contact, the feeling will probably become stronger and then it's basically just self-sabotage.";1;0.5;[[0.91801256]];[[0.59054783]];0.6397;0.154;0.7909999999999999;0.055999999999999994;0.9163;0.18600000000000003;0.7190000000000001;0.095;0.007000000000000006;0.43333333333333335;0.2577426046176046;0.17559072871572873
